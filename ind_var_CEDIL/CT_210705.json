In cross-age tutoring, an older learner takes the tutoring role and is paired with a younger tutee or tutees. Peer-assisted learning is a structured approach for mathematics and reading with sessions of 25-35 minutes two or three times a week. In reciprocal peer tutoring, learners alternate between the role of tutor and tutee. The common characteristic is that learners take on responsibility for aspects of teaching and for evaluating their success. Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools).

Approaches differ in how performance is measured and how closely those measures are linked to outcomes for learners.

In cross-age tutoring, an older learner takes the tutoring role and is paired with a younger tutee or tutees. Peer-assisted learning is a structured approach for mathematics and reading with sessions of 25-35 minutes two or three times a week. In reciprocal peer tutoring, learners alternate between the role of tutor and tutee. The common characteristic is that learners take on responsibility for aspects of teaching and for evaluating their success. Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools).

Approaches differ in how performance is measured and how closely those measures are linked to outcomes for learners.

Family Rewards, launched by the Center for Economic Opportunity in the Mayor's Office of the City of New York in 2007 and codesigned and evaluated by MDRC, offered cash assistance to low-income families conditioned on family investments in three areas: children's education, family preventive health care, and parents' employment. Results that rely on a random assignment design find that Family Rewards resulted in statistically significant increases in parental spending and saving on education for all students, and increased savings for those students most academically prepared at baseline and for girls, as well as statistically significant increases in academic time use and achievement outcomes for these same academically prepared students. There were no impacts on student motivations and self-beliefs. Implications are discussed for conditional cash transfer programs as well as for interventions targeting high-risk children and families.","Comments":"Accession Number: EJ1106495; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

Conditional Cash Transfer program in Turkey is a targeted social assistance program that is designed to provide support to the poorest 6 percent of the Turkish population. CCT is a sub-component of the Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP) of the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Solidarity (SYDGM). The specific objectives of the CCT in Turkey are to increase school attendance rates for the poor, decrease dropout rates, increase immunization coverage, and enhance the utilization of health facilities for the 1.1 million target beneficiaries. The program uses an indicator-based administrative targeting method to identify ultrapoor households with children aged 0-6 years, school-aged children 6-17 years, and childbearing-age women. The main purpose of this interim impact evaluation report is to provide rapid feedback on program implementation and estimates of impacts of the CCT program. The study is based on a large-scale quantitative household survey of beneficiaries of the education and the childhealth components of the CCT program, and the comparison group of nonbeneficiaryapplicants. The survey was carried out in 26 provinces of Turkey from December 2005 to March 2006.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Ahmed Akhter U; Gilligan Daniel ; Kudat Ayse ; Colasan Refik ; Tatlidil Huseyin ; Ozbilgin Bulent ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ahmed Akhter U, Gilligan Daniel, Kudat Ayse, Colasan Refik, Tatlidil Huseyin, and Ozbilgin Bulent (2006) Interim Impact Evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer Program in Turkey: A Quantitative Assessment.

An early evaluation of the program shows that the enrollment of eligible girls in middle school increased in the short term by nearly 9 percentage points. This paper uses regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference analyses to show that five years into the program implementation positive impacts do persist. Beneficiary adolescent girls are more likely to progress through and complete middle school and work less. There is suggestive evidence that participating girls delay their marriage and have fewer births by the time they are 19 years old. Girls who are exposed to the program later, and who are eligible for the benefits given in high school, increase their rates of matriculating into and completing high school. The persistence of impacts can potentially translate into gains in future productivity, consumption, inter-generational human capital accumulation and desired fertility. Lastly, there is no evidence that the program has negative spillover effects on educational outcomes of male siblings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Alam Andaleeb ; Baez Javier E; Del Carpio Ximena V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1596/1813-9450-5669","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alam Andaleeb, Baez Javier E, and Del Carpio Ximena V (2011) Does Cash for School Influence Young Women's Behavior in the Longer Term?

They do so by providing regular cash payments to families on the condition that they fulfill basic obligations, which are typically related to the usage of health and education services. The Government of Indonesia launched its own household conditional cash transfer program, Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH or Hopeful Family Program), in order to improve lagging health and education outcomes among extremely poor households. The program delivers quarterly cash transfers to very poor households with children or lactating/pregnant women provided that they fulfill a range of health and education-related obligations. PKH has emerged as one of the government's strategies to reduce poverty and reach its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Government of Indonesia is currently considering expanding coverage to 3 million households by 2014. This report presents the main findings from the impact evaluation of the PKH pilot. Chapter two describes the design of the household CCT program and a description of quality of implementation at the time of the impact evaluation. Chapter three summarizes the findings from the implementation assessments of the pilot. Chapter four reviews the design of the impact evaluation and provides an explanation about the research methodologies used. The main findings of the evaluation are presented in Chapter five. Chapter six presents a brief analysis of the costs of implementing the PKH program and PKH's cost-effectiveness. Finally, Section seven provides recommendations to policy-makers, applying findings from the evaluation to formulate next steps that should be considered during the planned expansion of the program.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Alatas V ; Cahyadi N ; Ekasari E ; Harmoun S ; Hidayat B ; Janz E ; Wai-Poi M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alatas V, Cahyadi N, Ekasari E, Harmoun S, Hidayat B, Janz E, and Wai-Poi M (2011) Program Keluarga Harapan : impact evaluation of Indonesia's Pilot Household Conditional Cash Transfer Program.

Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC) is a national child-protection programme that provides a flat monthly transfer of Ksh 1500 to ultra-poor families with orphans and vulnerable children aged 17 years and younger. A cluster randomised social experiment was conducted in 2007-2009 to evaluate the impact of this programme. We use these data to provide an in-depth analysis of the effects of the programme on children's human capital development. Because basic schooling is free in Kenya and enrolment rates are relatively high, the scope of an unconditional programme such as the CT-OVC may be small. We use data from the evaluation baseline as well as national survey data to make ex-ante predictions about where the programme is most likely to have a big impact. We compare these predictions with actual programme impacts as a way of assessing whether the programme has had the expected impact on children's human capital development given the institutional environment. We find that the programme has had an impact on the margins we would expect, and the size of the impact on secondary school enrolment of this unconditional programme is comparable with those from conditional programmes in other parts of the world. The ex-ante analysis is crucial to understanding where to look to appropriately assess the impact of the programme.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alviar Carlos ; Davis Benjamin ; Handa Sudhanshu ; Hurrell Alex ; Hussein Ahmed ; Musembi Daniel ; Ochieng Samuel ; Pearson Roger ; Pellerano Luca ; Visram Aly ; Ward Patrick ; Team Kenya CT-OVC Evaluation; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/19439342.2011.653578","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alviar Carlos, Davis Benjamin, Handa Sudhanshu, Hurrell Alex, Hussein Ahmed, Musembi Daniel, Ochieng Samuel, Pearson Roger, Pellerano Luca, Visram Aly, Ward Patrick, and Team Kenya CT-OVC Evaluation (2012) The impact of Kenya's Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children on human capital.

migrants matching funds for educational remittances, which are channeled directly to a beneficiary student in El Salvador chosen by the migrant. The matches lead to increased educational expenditures, higher private school attendance, and lower labor supply of youths in El Salvador households connected to migrant study participants. We find substantial \"crowd-in\" of educational investments: for each $1 received by beneficiaries, educational expenditures increase by $3.72.

Using data from the PROGRESA program in Mexico, we exploit information on the paternal and maternal surnames of heads and spouses in conjunction with the Spanish naming convention to identify the inter- and intra-generational family links of each household to others in the same village. We then exploit the randomized research design of the PROGRESA evaluation data to identify whether the treatment effects of PROGRESA transfers on secondary school enrolment vary according to the characteristics of extended family. We find PROGRESA only raises secondary enrolment among households that are embedded in a family network. Eligible but isolated households do not respond. The mechanism through which the extended family influences household schooling choices is the redistribution of resources within the family network from eligibles that receive de facto unconditional cash transfers from PROGRESA, towards eligibles on the margin of enrolling children into secondary school. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Impact.pdf","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"This report evaluates the impact of the Conditional Cash Transfer for Secondary School Education program in the Republic of Macedonia, and compares alternative designs of this program at the end of its second and third years. The progrtam provides cash transfers to poor households (those eligible for social assistance) if they have children of the secondary school age who attend secondary school at least 85 per cent of the time. The total amount of the subsidy is 12,000 Macedoniandenars (MKD) per year paid in quarterly instalments. The program was first implemented at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year. Different variants of the payment scheme were implemented from the start of the program. Firstly, the quarterly payments could be MKD 3000 each or there could be a bonus at the end of the school year. In the latter scheme, the first three payments are of MKD 2000 each and the last payment is of MKD 6000. Secondly, the identity of the transfer recipient could be either the child's mother or the head of the child's household. The comparison of different designs of the program is experimental, with different schemes implemented in different municipalities. There was random assignment of alternative payment designs to municipalities, through a lottery. We first randomized the 84 municipalities in Macedonia into two groups. In one group of 42 municipalities, the mother receives the payment. In the other group of 42 municipalities, the household head receives the payment, regardless of gender. We then conducted a secondary lottery, again dividing the municipalities into two equal groups of 42. One group receives the payment in equal installments and the other receives a graduation or end of year bonus. These two lotteries ensure that the municipalities receiving different payment mpdalities are very similar, and therefore comparable. Measuring the overall impact of the program (rather than comparing different designs) is more difficult since the program is implemented simultaneously in the whole country, so the choice of a control group to evaluate the program is not straightforward. We use a difference-in-differences strategy in this study. The group of eligible households comprises social financial assistance recipients with children of secondary school age. The comparison group (slightly better off group) consists of child allowance recipients with children of secondary school age. Although the two groups are different and therefore not immediatly comparable, the assumption of this method is that the trend in outcomes experienced by child allowance households is the same as what would be experienced by social financial assistance households in the absence of the conditional cash transfer. In order to evaluate the program and its different modalities, we collected three waves of a rich household survey that we matched with school records on school attendance and performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Armand Alex ; Carneiro Pedro ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Armand Alex, and Carneiro Pedro (2018) Impact evaluation of the conditional cash transfer program for secondary school attendance in Macedonia: Impact Evaluation Report 69.

The analysis relies on data from the Living Standards Measurement Survey of 2008. It uses a propensity score matching technique to identify the impact of the program by replicating the selection criteria followed by the government. Our results show that the program increased school enrollment and was able to reduce child labor in both areas. In rural areas, the impact of the program on education outcomes was restricted to enrollment in middle school where we estimated an increase of 10.2 percentage points (pp). The program also increased the proportion of children that completed elementary school by 13.8 pp, although it did not have an impact on enrollment in elementary or high school. In indigenous areas, the impact of the program on education outcomes was restricted to enrollment in elementary school where we estimate an increase of 7.9 pp. Additionally, the results show that the program reduced child labor in children ages 12 to 15 in both areas: by 10.1 pp in rural areas and 15.8 pp in indigenous areas. With regard to preventive health care services, we found no evidence of impact on the numbers of visits to health care providers or the number of vaccines that children received. However, we estimated that the proportion of women who had a Papanicolau test screening because of the program increased by 11.7 pp in rural areas and 14.7 pp in indigenous areas. Sadly, we found that the program might also have led to an increase in the number of pregnancies in rural areas: the proportion of pregnant women in 2008 was 3.2 pp higher in the beneficiary group than in the control group, and the number of pregnancies since the beginning of the program increased by 0.44 among beneficiaries – despite the fact that the number of children ages 3 to 6, who were born before the implementation of the program, was not statistically different between the groups.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Arraiz Irani ; Rozo Sandra ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.1847124","Keywords":"Conditional Cash Transfer\r\nImpact Evaluation\r\nIrani Arraiz\r\nPanama\r\nSSRN\r\nSame Bureaucracy\r\nSandra Rozo","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arraiz Irani, and Rozo Sandra (2012) Same Bureaucracy, Different Outcomes in Human Capital?

Such conditional cash transfers have been particularly popular in education and nutrition policies – that is, in policies whose aim is to foster the accumulation of human capital among young children. In the case of the nutrition interventions, the conditions are often that the mother of the children, who receives the transfers, enrols them to development and growth check-ups and/or attends hygiene, vaccination and contraception courses. Much of the attention on conditional transfer programmes originated from the perceived success of a large programme of this nature started in rural Mexico in 1998 and evaluated scientifically with semi-experimental methods. Since the evidence on PROGRESA, as the Mexican programme was known, has received much attention, several international organisations have been promoting similar interventions in many developing countries and in particular in Latin America. It should be stressed that while PROGRESA has been widely branded as a success and has surely improved the nutritional and development outcomes of very young children and enrolment for secondary school, the reasons behind this success are not entirely obvious. In particular, it is not completely clear whether the conditionalities imposed by the programme played a role in determining the outcomes and what that role was.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Attanasio O ; Syed M ; Vera-Hernandez M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"book chapters\r\nconference proceedings\r\ndigital web resources\r\ndiscovery\r\njournal articles\r\nopen access\r\nopen access repository\r\nresearch\r\ntheses\r\nucl\r\nucl discovery\r\nucl library\r\nucl research","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Attanasio O, Syed M, and Vera-Hernandez M (2004) Early evaluation of a new nutrition and education programme in Colombia.

Using a difference‐in‐difference framework, our results show that the program increased school participation of 14–17‐year‐old children quite substantially, by between 5 and 7 percentage points and had lower effects on the enrollment of younger children, in the region of 1–3 percentage points. The effects on work are largest in the relatively more urbanized parts of rural areas and particularly for younger children, whose participation in domestic work decreased by around 13 percentage points after the program, as compared to a decrease of 10 percentage points for older children in these same areas. The program had no discernible impacts on children’s work in more rural areas. Participation in income‐generating work remained largely unaffected by the program. We also find evidence of school and work time not being fully substitutable, suggesting that some, but not all, of the increased time at school may be drawn from children’s leisure time.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Attanasio Orazio ; Fitzsimons Emla ; Gomez Ana ; Meghir Costas ; Mesnard Alice ; GutiéRrez Martha Isabel; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1086/648188","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Attanasio Orazio, Fitzsimons Emla, Gomez Ana, Meghir Costas, Mesnard Alice, and GutiéRrez Martha Isabel (2010) Children's schooling and work in the presence of a conditional cash transfer program in rural Colombia.

school participation. We show the usefulness of using experimental data to estimate a structural economic model as well as the importance of a structural model in interpreting experimental results. The availability of the experiment also allows us to estimate the program's general equilibrium effects, which we then incorporate into our simulations. Our main findings are (i) the program's grant has a much stronger impact on school enrolment than an equivalent reduction in child wages; (ii) the program has a positive effect on the enrollment of children , especially after primary school; this result is well replicated by the parsimonious structural model; (iii) there are sizeable effects of the program on child wages, which, however, reduce the effectiveness of the program only marginally; and (iv) a revenue neutral change in the program that would increase the grant for secondary school children while eliminating for the primary school children would have a substantially larger effect on enrollment of the latter, while having minor effects on the former.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Attanasio Orazio P; Meghir Costas ; Development Bank ; Interamerican  ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1093/restud/rdr015","Keywords":"C52\r\nD04\r\nDynamic models\r\nEducation choices\r\nImpact evaluation JEL Codes: I20","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Attanasio Orazio P, Meghir Costas, Development Bank, and Interamerican  (2011) Education Choices in Mexico: Using a Structural Model and a Randomized Experiment to Evaluate PROGRESA and ANA SANTIAGO.

cash transfers are programs under which poor families get a stipend provided they keep their children in school and take them for health checks. Although there is significant evidence showing that they have positive impacts on school participation, little is known about the long-term impacts of the programs on human capital. This paper investigates whether cohorts of children from poor households that benefited up to nine years from Familias en Acción, a conditional cash transfer program in Colombia, attained more school and performed better on academic tests at the end of high school. Identification of program impacts is derived from two different strategies using matching techniques with household surveys, and regression discontinuity design using a census of the poor and administrative records of the program. The authors show that, on average, participant children are 4 to 8 percentage points more likely than nonparticipant children to finish high school, particularly girls and beneficiaries in rural areas. Regarding long-term impact on tests scores, the analysis shows that program recipients who graduate from high school seem to perform at the same level as equally poor non-recipient graduates, even after correcting for possible selection bias when low-performing students enter school in the treatment group. Although the positive impacts on high school graduation may improve the employment and earning prospects of participants, the lack of positive effects on test scores raises the need to further explore policy actions to couple the program's objective of increasing human capital with enhanced learning.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Baez Javier E; Camacho Adriana ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1596/1813-9450-5681","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baez Javier E, and Camacho Adriana (2013) Assessing the Long-Term Effects of Conditional Cash Transfers on Human Capital: Evidence from Colombia.

The program featured two distinct interventions: unconditional transfers (UCT arm) and transfers conditional on school attendance (CCT arm). Although there was a modest decline in the dropout rate in the UCT arm in comparison with the control group, it was only 43% as large as the impact in the CCT arm at the end of the 2-year program. The CCT arm also outperformed the UCT arm in tests of English reading comprehension. However, teenage pregnancy and marriage rates were substantially lower in the UCT than the CCT arm, entirely due to the impact of UCTs on these outcomes among girls who dropped out of school.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baird S ; McIntosh C ; Özler B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baird S, McIntosh C, and Özler B (2011) Cash or condition?

Policies that enable them to reach their full potential can have a strong impact not only on their own wellbeing, but also on that of future generations. This paper summarizes the short-term impacts of a cash transfer program on the empowerment of adolescent girls in Malawi during and immediately after the two-year intervention. We find that the program, which transferred cash directly to school-age girls as well as their parents, had effects on a broad range of important domains - including increased access to financial resources, improved schooling outcomes, decreased teen pregnancies and early marriages, better health - and generally enabled beneficiaries to improve their agency within their households. Underlying these overall impacts, the experiment revealed important differences in program effects between young women who were in school at the start of the intervention and those that were not, as well as between young women who received cash transfers conditional on regular school attendance and those who received cash unconditionally. The results point to the potential role that cash transfer programs can play in improving the lives of adolescent girls in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the heterogeneity of effects under different program designs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Baird Sarah ; Chirwa Ephraim ; de Hoop Jacobus ; Özler Berk ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3386/w19479","Keywords":"Berk Özler\r\nEphraim Chirwa\r\nJacobus de Hoop\r\nSarah J.

This paper presents one-year schooling impacts from a conditional cash transfer experiment among teenage girls and young women in Malawi, which was designed to address these shortcomings: conditionality status, size of separate transfers to the schoolgirl and the parent, and village-level saturation of treatment were all independently randomized. The authors find that the program had large impacts on school attendance: the re-enrollment rate among those who had already dropped out of school before the start of the program increased by two and a half times and the dropout rate among those in school at baseline decreased from 11 to 6 percent. These impacts were, on average, similar in the conditional and the unconditional treatment arms. Although most schooling outcomes examined here were unresponsive to variation in the size of the transfer to the parents, higher transfers given directly to the schoolgirls were associated with significantly improved school attendance and progress - but only if the transfers were conditional on school attendance. There were no spillover effects within treatment communities after the first year of program implementation. Policymakers looking to design cost-effective cash transfer programs targeted toward young women should note the relative insensitivity of these short-term program impacts with respect to conditionality and total transfer size.","Comments":"This study has 3 conditions: conditional cash trasnfer (CCT), unconditional cash transfer (UCT), control.

We present one-year schooling impacts from a CCT experiment among teenage girls and young women in Malawi, which was designed to address these shortcomings. The program features four independently randomized dimensions of contract variation: the conditionality, transfer size, schoolgirl/parent transfer splits, and village-level saturation of treatment are all experimentally varied. Despite this rich heterogeneity in contract terms, we find large program impacts that are surprisingly binary. While the re-enrollment rate among those who had already dropped out of school before the start of the program increased by two and a half times and the dropout rate among those in school at baseline decreased from 11% to 6%, these impacts were generally similar regardless of the specific contract terms. If the one-year impacts were to persist, they would indicate that a bare-bones unconditional cash transfer program using low monthly transfers, at least some of which are directly transferred to the children would be the most cost-effective way to increase enrollment in this population.","Comments":"This study has 3 conditions: conditional cash trasnfer (CCT), unconditional cash transfer (UCT), control.

Numerous evaluations, often based on rigorous experimental designs, leave little doubt that such programs can increase enrollment and grades attained--in the short term. But evidence is notably lacking on whether these short-term gains translate into longer-term educational benefits needed to fully justify these programs. This paper uses the randomized phase-in of the RPS CCT program in Nicaragua to estimate the long-term effects on educational attainment and learning for boys, measured 10 years after the start of the program. We focus on a cohort of boys aged 9-12 years at the start of the program in 2000 who, due to the program's eligibility criteria and prior school dropout patterns, were likely to have benefitted more in the group of localities that were randomly selected to receive the program first. We find that the short-term program effect of a half grade increase in schooling for boys was sustained after the end of the program and into early adulthood. In addition, results indicate significant and substantial gains in both math and language achievement scores, an approximately one-quarter standard deviation increase in learning outcomes for the now young men. Hence in Nicaragua, schooling and achievement gains coincided, implying important longterm returns to CCT programs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Barham T ; Macours K ; Maluccio J A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barham T, Macours K, and Maluccio J A (2012) More schooling and more learning?

Just looking at the changes in the enrollment rates between 1997 and 1998/1999\nfor treatment children (penultimate columns in Tables 2.1-3) is not informative about the enrollment\nquestion because there were secular upward trends in enrollments independent of PROGRESA, as is\nreflected in the increased enrollment rates for the control children in 1998 and 1999 (second and third\nsets of estimates in Tables 2.1-3). The difference-in-difference estimates in the last columns of Tables\n2.1-3 control for such common secular trends by subtracting the change in the control enrollment rates\nover time from the change in the treatment enrollment rates over time. These estimates indicate\nsignificant enrollment rate increases for the treatment group beyond those for the control group between\n1997 and 1999 of 6.9% for 12 year olds, 7.7% for 13 year olds, and 8.9% for 14 year olds (and\npositive, though not significant at the 5% level increases for all other ages in the 10-17 range). For each\nof these ages for which the estimates are significant the differences in the differences are larger for\nfemales than are those for males -- 11.9% versus 2.1% for 12 year olds, 8.8% versus 7.2% for 13 year\nolds, and 13.2% versus 5.8% for 14 year olds – and only the differences-in-the-differences for females,\nnot for males, are significantly nonzero at the 5% level.

One possibly important channel through which such investments may have such impacts is through increasing cognitive achievement of children. Previous literature suggests that improved cognitive achievement has payoffs in terms of greater wages and perhaps productivities in labor markets in developing countries. This paper evaluates the short-run effects on children’s cognitive achievements of PROGRESA. One major component of PROGRESA is transfer payments to poor families with children enrolled in grades 3-6 of primary school and grades 1-3 of secondary school. Other components of PROGRESA include general transfers to such families and explicit nutrition supplements and health support for infants and small children. PROGRESA might have impact on children’s cognitive achievement through a number of channels, some of which are relatively short run and others are relatively longer run. Previous IFRPIPROGRESA Evaluation Project papers have considered some aspects of possible changes induced by PROGRESA that may have led or may eventually lead to improved cognitive achievement. But none of these studies consider the effects on child achievement test scores. Section 1 introduces the topic. Section 2 describes the PROGRESA program, with emphasis on the features directly related to schooling, which focus on enrollment and attendance. The payment schedule for transfers for school attendance is presented and discussed, with reference to the increasing payments with grade level because of perceived increasing opportunity costs with grade levels and higher payments for females than for males atthe secondary level because of perceived lower enrollment rates for females than males at those levels. Section 3 outlines methods for estimating the impact of PROGRESA on test scores. These include methods to control to the extent that the data permit for changing composition of those who take the tests. If, for example, PROGRESA induces greater enrollments of marginal students, the change in composition of the students taking the tests in itself will cause test scores to fall. Section 4 presents data on enrollments and summarizes the patterns in enrollment because the program is directly conditional on enrollment, as well as patterns in age-specific schooling attainment gaps. These estimates address three general points: 1. The Relation Between Pre-program Enrollments and Differential Incentives by Age and Sex in the Payment Structure: (i) In the pre-PROGRESA 1997 data, enrollment rates averaged over 90% for the 7-11 age range, and then fell by about 10 percent for every added year of age. This is consistent with the general pattern of incentives from transfers becoming positive for later grades of primary school and increasing with the grade level But itsuggests that the incentives could have little effect for primary grades 3, 4 and possibly 5 because most children in these grades are in the 8-11 age range and over 90% of this age range were enrolled prior to PROGRESA. Thus, from looking at the pre-program data alone, it would appear that the same resources could have been used more effectively to increase enrollments by directing them more to higher grades and older children. (ii) In the pre-PROGRESA 1997 data, enrollment rates fell substantially for ages right above those at which most children finished primary school – ages 12-14, which relates to the rationale for the large percentage increase in the transfers for secondary grade 1. But enrollments continued to fall fairly sharply for still older ages, at which ages many children who are still in school are in secondary grade 2 or higher. So it is not clear that such a sharp increase in the transfer between primary grade 6 and secondary grade 1 compared to the increases for advancing in secondary school beyond grade 1 is warranted as is embodied in the program. (iii) In the pre-PROGRESA 1997 data, there was not a systematic difference in enrollment rates between females and males for the 6-10 age range. For ages 11 and older enrollment rates were higher for males than for females. These data, thus, prima facie seem consistent with the rationale for higher transfers for femalesthan for males because the former have lower enrollment rates for secondary school ages that are embodied in the PROGRESA transfer schedule. But part of this gender difference in age-specific enrollment rates does notreflect that females are receiving less schooling, but that males lag behind the standard grade progression rate more than do females because of lower grade progression rates. The average gaps in schooling attainment were in fact generally larger for males than for females. Thus there seems to be no basis in terms of schooling gaps or schooling attainment prior to PROGRESA for favoring females relative to males. Males apparently had higher enrollment rates in the age range 11-18 because they were on the average behind the females in age-specific schooling attainment, not ahead. So if it were desirable to have differential incentives by gender, it would seem that they should have favored males, not females. 2. Whether Enrollments and Schooling Gaps Were Different Between the Treatment and Control Samples Prior to PROGRESA: There was random assignment of localities between treatment and control groups. But that does not mean that households or individuals are randomly assigned between treatment and control groups. In fact, a previous project study finds that although on the locality level characteristics appear to be random between control and treatment samples, on the household and individual levels they differ systematically more oftenthan would be expected were there random assignment by household or individuals. But prior to PROGRESA enrollment rates and schooling gap rates indeed were not different between the control and treatment groups at the individual level. 3. The Impact of PROGRESA on Enrollments and Schooling Gaps: These estimates indicate significant enrollment rate increases for the treatment group beyond those for the control group between 1997 and 1999 for 12-14 year olds. For each of these ages for which the estimates are significant the estimates are larger for females than are those for males -- 11.9% versus 2.1% for 12 year olds, 8.8% versus 7.2% for 13 year olds, and 13.2% versus 5.8% for 14 year olds – and only the estimates for females, not for males, are significantly nonzero. Therefore PROGRESA seems to have been effective basically in increasing enrollments of females in the 12-14 age range. This success is consistent with the intent to focus on the ages related to the transition from primary to secondary school and the initial grades of secondary school for which previous dropout rates were high and with the intent to favor females. This latter success, however, may have exacerbated the gender gap in schooling attainment because, as noted above, even though age-specific enrollment rates prior to the program were lower for females than for males, age-specific schooling gaps were higher (and schooling attainment lower) for males than for females apparently because females had higher promotion rates than males. The lack of significant impact on enrollments of individuals younger than 12 is not surprising given the observation above about the high enrollment rates for such individuals in the pre-PROGRESA data – but it reinforces the point made above about whether the resources for transfers currently used for enrollment in primary 3 and 4 and perhaps 5 could be more effective if they were used for higher grades of school. With regard to the schooling gap, the overall estimates indicate significant reductions of this gap in the treatment relative to the control group of -0.15 grades for 11 year olds and of -0.31 grades for 15 year olds. Thus the latter provides some evidence of effects on teenagers, but for fewer ages than for enrollments. This is plausible both because the program is focused more on enrollments than attainment and because enrollments reflect shorter-run decisions and outcomes at the start of the year rather than for the whole year as for grade completion. The suggestion of an impact on 11 year olds is interesting because there is no evidence of significant impact on enrollments for that age or younger individuals. That means that any effect on the schooling gap for that age was due to a higher grade progression rate. The magnitudes of the estimates for females and malesseparately for these two ages, finally, indicate that the effects are the same by gender (though only those for 15 year olds are significantly nonzero at the 5% level). This contrasts with the enrollment results and also means that for the limited time period for which schooling gap estimates can be made, so far PROGRESA does not seem to have exacerbated gender gaps despite the results for a longer period for enrollment that suggests that it may have done so. Section 5 presents data on achievement and estimates of the impact of the program on achievement test scores. To permit evaluation of the impact of PROGRESA on achievement test scores, PROGRESA arranged for the Secretary of Pubic Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública, SEP) to administer the same tests for students in schools attended by individuals in the PROGRESA Evaluation Sample as SEP administers annually to a national sample of schools. These tests were administered to students in about 500 primary and secondary schools in the localities in the PROGRESA Evaluation Sample plus schools close to these localities. These test data have some important limitations for the analysis ofthis paper: (1) Only the shorter-run effects -- basically for the first year -- can be investigated even though some of the more important impact of PROGRESA on cognitive achievement,","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Behrman J ; Sengupta P ; Todd P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Behrman J, Sengupta P, and Todd P (2000) The Impact of Progresa on Achievement Test Scores in the First Year: Final Report.

Program Oportunidades (formerly PROGRESA) has been operating in small rural communities since 1997, providing cash grants to families in exchange for regular school attendance of children and youth as well as regular health clinic attendance and nutritional supplements for infants and very young children and for pregnant and lactating women. This paper provides estimates of the medium-term impacts on education for rural children aged 0 to 8 in 1997 just prior to the initial rural intervention, or those aged 6 to 14 in the 2003 Rural Evaluation Survey. The education of the oldest children within this age range would have been expected to have been affected primarily by the scholarship component of the program. The education of the youngest children within this age range, in contrast, would not have been affected directly by the scholarship component of the program by 2003 because they were too young to have advanced by then to the third grade at which the scholarships begin (though there may have been indirect effects through expectations about scholarships in the future). But on the other hand, these children were beneficiaries of the infant nutritional supplements, which may have improved their educational performance when they became of school age. The results in this paper extend those of previous evaluations based on the Rural Evaluation Surveys between 1998 and 2000 and are complementary to the concurrent evaluation for rural children aged 15-21 in 2003. Our analysis is based on new information provided in the 2003 Rural Evaluation Survey (ENCEL), which is linked with earlier data, in particular the 1997 pre-program Survey of Household Socio-economic Characteristics (ENCASEH) data. The ENCEL2003 provides another round of information on the original evaluation treatment and control households who began receiving Oportunidades benefits in 1998 and 2000 respectively. The original program evaluation was characterized by a random experiment with households from 320 communities with less than 2,500 inhabitants being assigned to receive benefits (T1998) and households from 186 being assigned to receive benefits approximately 18 months later (T2000). Given the incorporation of the original control group to receive benefits in 2000, the ENCEL2003 also included a new comparison group (C2003), constructed through the matching of communities to the communities of the original ENCEL evaluation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Behrman Jere R; Parker Susan W; Todd Petra E;

antipoverty program in Mexico, PROGRESA, provides monetary transfers to families that are contingent upon their children’s regular attendance at school. The benefit levels vary with the grade level and gender of the child and are intended to offset the opportunity costs of not sending children to school. The initial phase of the program was implemented as a randomized social experiment. This article uses a Markov schooling transition model applied to the experimental data to assess the impact of the subsidy program on schooling attainment and on the underlying behaviors that determine schooling attainment, including ages of matriculation, dropout rates, grade repetition rates, and school reentry rates. Results show that the program increases schooling attainment effectively by reducing dropout rates and facilitating grade progression, particularly during the transition from primary to secondary school. Many of these effects would not be clear if attention were limited to enrollments as in much of the previous literature. A simulation evaluating the effects of longer terms of exposure to the program indicates that, if children were to participate between ages 6 to 14, there would be an increase of 0.7 years in average educational attainment levels and an increase of 21% in the proportion of children attending junior secondary school, with somewhat larger effects for boys than for girls.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Behrman Jere R; Sengupta Piyali ; Todd Petra ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1086/431263","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Behrman Jere R, Sengupta Piyali, and Todd Petra (2005) Progressing through PROGRESA: An impact assessment of a school subsidy experiment in rural Mexico.

It analyzes data from a social experiment, which randomly phased-in the program in rural Mexican villages. In 1997, 320 villages (the treatment group) were randomly selected for early incorporation into the program and 186 villages (the control group) were designated as a control group to be incorporated eighteen months later. This paper examines whether differential exposure to the program significantly impacted educational attainment, labor market outcomes, marriage, migration and cognitive achievement of youth. The results show positive impacts of longer exposure on grades of schooling attained, but no effects on achievement tests. With respect to work, we find an overall reduction in work for male youth.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Behrman J R; Parker S W; Todd P E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Behrman J R, Parker S W, and Todd P E (2005) Long-Term Impacts of the Oportunidades Conditional Cash Transfer Program on Rural Youth in Mexico. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067971,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":585989,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs\"\n\"Mexico’s PROGRESA/Oportunida-\ndes[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Behrman_2010.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067980,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":585989,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"CCT programs aim, in addition to\nmoderating current poverty, to alleviate future poverty by increasing human capital\naccumulation of children and youth from poor families and thereby increasing their\nincome when they become adults.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Behrman_2010.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067979,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":585989,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"PROGRESA/Oportunidades began operating in small rural commu-\nnities in 1997.

Previous evaluations of CCT programs focus mainly on rural settings, and little is known about their effects in urban areas. This paper studies the short-term (1- and 2-year) effects of the Mexican Oportunidades CCT program on urban children/youth. The program provides financial incentives for children/youth to attend school and for family members to visit health clinics. To participate, families had to sign up for the program and be deemed eligible. Difference-in-difference propensity score-matching estimates indicate that the program is successful in increasing school enrollment, schooling attainment and time devoted to homework for girls and boys and in decreasing working rates of boys. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Behrman Jere R; Gallardo-García Jorge ; Parker Susan W; Todd Petra E; Vélez-Grajales Viviana ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/09645292.2012.672792","Keywords":"Conditional cash transfers\r\nMatching methods\r\nMexico\r\nOportunidades\r\nSchooling","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Behrman Jere R, Gallardo-García Jorge, Parker Susan W, Todd Petra E, and Vélez-Grajales Viviana (2012) Are conditional cash transfers effective in urban areas?

The per household transfer was much larger than an earlier experiment, but it yielded smaller short-run effects on school enrollment, child labor participation, and use of health services. One explanation is that Bono 10,000 did not apply conditions to all children: only one school-age child in participating households was subject to the education condition, and young children and mothers were only subject to the health conditions in the absence of school-age children. Consistent with this, we find a large enrollment increase (and offsetting decrease in labor participation) among households with one eligible child and smaller and insignificant effects on children in larger households. We only find significant effects on health service use among children and mothers in the absence of a school-age child (despite a smaller household transfer). The heterogeneity is not driven by variables correlated with the number of children such as household size, child age, birth order, or poverty.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Benedetti Fiorella ; Ibarrarán Pablo ; McEwan Patrick J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1086/686583","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Benedetti Fiorella, Ibarrarán Pablo, and McEwan Patrick J (2016) Do education and health conditions matter in a large cash transfer?

We use a large randomized experiment in Morocco to estimate an alternative government-run program, a \"labeled cash transfer\" (LCT): a small cash transfer made to fathers of school-aged children in poor rural communities, not conditional on school attendance but explicitly labeled as an education support program. We document large gains in school participation. Adding conditionality and targeting mothers made almost no difference in our context. The program increased parents' belief that education was a worthwhile investment, a likely pathway for the results.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Benhassine Najy ; Devoto Florencia ; Duflo Esther ; Dupas Pascaline ; Pouliquen Victor ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1257/pol.20130225","Keywords":"Housing\r\nHuman Development\r\nIncome Distribution\r\nInfrastructure\r\nLabor Productivity, Economic Development: Human Resources\r\nMigration, Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis\r\nOccupational Choice\r\nProvision and Effects of Welfare Programs, Human Capital\r\nRedistributive Effects\r\nSkills\r\nTaxation and Subsidies: Externalities","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Benhassine Najy, Devoto Florencia, Duflo Esther, Dupas Pascaline, and Pouliquen Victor (2015) Turning a shove into a nudge?: A \"labeled cash transfer\" for education.

outcomes vary by key characteristics associated with families' propensity to earn the rewards offered by the program. We utilize an experimental study of Opportunity NYC-Family Rewards, a comprehensive CCT program in New York City in which low-income families were offered rewards for outcomes in health, education, and work. Building from a technique in propensity score research but used here to assess subgroup impacts in experimental studies, we use multiple baseline characteristics to predict the amount of rewards earned as a means to identify theoretically important, multivariate-defined groups of children for whom program effects might be more concentrated. Fourth-grade children in families with higher likelihood to earn rewards experienced more positive impacts of the program on academic outcomes. By contrast, no program impacts were found among 7th- or 9th-graders whose families were most likely to earn rewards. Differences across age groups are discussed in terms of their different developmental periods and the differing way the children experienced the intervention.","Comments":"Accession Number: EJ1024067; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

Targeting income discontinuities are not observed around the thresholds to participate in the program and this result invalidates the use of regression discontinuity designs for evaluating causal effects of the intervention. We apply the propensity score matching estimator to account for the endogeneity of program participation. We find that the program has no impact on school attendance but reduces female child labor in Montevideo. In addition negative effects are detected on the labor market in the rest of the urban areas.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Borraz Fernando ; González Nicolás ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.4067/S0717-68212009000200006","Keywords":"Conditional cash transfer program\r\nPropensity score matching\r\nTargeting method","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Borraz Fernando, and González Nicolás (2009) Impact of the uruguayan conditional cash transfer program.

It was expected that many families would find it difficult to keep their children in school and that dropout rates would be high, as they were during a recession in the 1980s. But dropouts did not increase markedly and enrollment rates remained relatively steady. The author examines the role the scholarship program played in producing this result. She found the scholarships to have been effective in reducing dropouts in the lower secondary school (where students are more susceptible to dropping out) by about 3 percentage points. They had no discernible impact in primary and upper secondary schools. The author also examines how well the program adhered to its documented targeting design and how effective that design was in reaching the poor. Committees that allocated the scholarships followed the criteria diligently, but a significant percentage of scholarships did go to students from households with high reported per capita expenditures, if household expenditure data are reliable. It is unclear how targeting can be improved, giving the scarcity of accurate local household data in most countries. Using local monitoring could help but then monitoring for accountability would be more difficult. Preliminary evidence favors focusing safety net scholarships--designed to reduce dropout rates during an economic crisis--on lower secondary schools, continuing to target children (especially older students) from large families, scaling back scholarships to private schools at the lower secondary level, or targeting the households hurt most by the crisis.\"","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Cameron Lisa ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"no DOI","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cameron Lisa (2002) Did Social Safety Net Scholarships Reduce Drop-Out Rates During The Indonesian Economic Crisis?. : ,  DOI: no DOI"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067973,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"The report describes multiple cash transfer and social assistance programs, and the treatment group is described as families where 'parents receive transfers from social programs'.

It describes Brazil's transfer programs and presents statistics on school attendance and child labor. In the second half of the 1990s, many municipalities had adopted the \"Bolsa Escola\" (a cash transfer conditional on school attendance) and/or the federal minimum income program (in place during 1999 and 2000 and replaced by the \"Bolsa Escola Federal\" in 2001). Although conditional cash transfer programs in Brazil have been in place since 1996, studies on their ex-post impact are very few. Micro household level data from the 2000 Census allows the use of propensity score methods to estimate the impact of income transfers on child labor and school attendance. The paper finds that income transfer programs had no significant effect on child labor but a positive and significant impact on school attendance. These preliminary results suggest that these programs have not been effective in fighting child labor in Brazil. They increase the chance of a poor child going to school but do not reduce her labor activity perhaps because she prefers to combine school and labor, considering that the transfers are too small to provide an incentive to forgo the labor income.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Cardoso Eliana ; Souza Andre Portela; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Brazil\r\nChild labor\r\nincome transfer programs\r\nschool attendance","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cardoso Eliana, and Souza Andre Portela (2004) The Impact of Cash Transfers on Child Labor and School Attendance in Brazil. : Vanderbilt University Department of Economics, 1-51"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067971,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"The South African Child Support Grant","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586138,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"the South African Child Support Grant[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Case_2005.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067979,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586138,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"a non-\nconditional means-tested cash transfer targeted at poor children under the age of 7 in\nSouth Africa.

investments in child education and health as well as use of maternal health services. The objective of the program is to promote investments in the education and health of children to help break the intergenerational transmission of poverty, while providing immediate financial support to the household. Poor households are identified by the National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR) based on a transparent poverty targeting mechanism, using a statistical model 1 to estimate income. Households with estimated income below the poverty line are classified as poor. From that database of poor households, Pantawid Pamilya identifies and selects eligible households who have children 0-14 years of age and/or a pregnant woman. These households then receive cash grants every two months ranging from PhP 500 to PhP 1,400 per household per month, depending on the number of eligible childrenThis report presents the findings from an analysis that assessed program impact by comparing outcomes in areas that received Pantawid Pamilya with outcomes in areas that did not receive the program.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Chaudhury N ; Friedman J ; Onishi J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in

mean-tested conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs, some countries have implemented gender-targeted CCTs to explicitly address intra-household disparities in human capital investments. This study focuses on addressing the direct impact of a female school stipend program in Punjab, Pakistan: Did the intervention increase female enrollment in public schools? To address this question, the authors draw on data from the provincial school censuses of 2003 and 2005. They estimate the net growth in female enrollments in grades 6-8 in stipend eligible schools. Impact evaluation analysis, including difference-and-difference (DD), triple differencing (DDD), and regression-discontinuity design (RDD) indicate a modest but statistically significant impact of the intervention. The preferred estimator derived from a combination of DDD and RDD empirical strategies suggests that the average program impact between 2003 and 2005 was an increase of six female students per school in terms of absolute change and an increase of 9 percent in female enrollment in terms of relative change. A triangulation effort is also undertaken using two rounds of a nationally representative household survey before and after the intervention. Even though the surveys are not representative at the subprovincial level, the results corroborate evidence of the impact using school census data.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Chaudhury Nazmul ; Parajuli Dilip ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1596/1813-9450-4102","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chaudhury Nazmul, and Parajuli Dilip (2013) Conditional Cash Transfers And Female Schooling : The Impact Of The Female School Stipend Program On Public School Enrollments In Punjab, Pakistan.

decade, the most popular policy tool used to increase human capital in developing countries has been the conditional cash transfer program. A large literature has shown significant mean impacts on schooling, health, and child labor. This paper examines heterogeneous effects using random‐assignment data from the Red de Proteccion Social in rural Nicaragua. Using interactions between the targeting criteria and the treatment indicator, estimates suggest that children located in more impoverished localities experienced a larger impact of the program on schooling in 2001, but this finding is reversed in 2002. Estimated quantile treatment effects indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of the program on the distribution of food expenditures, as well as total expenditures. In particular, households at the lower end of the expenditure distribution experienced a smaller increase in expenditures. This study also presents evidence of the rank invariance assumption to help clarify the interpretation of the quantile treatment effect in the development literature context.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dammert Ana C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1086/605205","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dammert Ana C (2009) Heterogeneous impacts of conditional cash transfers: Evidence from nicaragua.

this paper, we examine how the design of cash transfer schemes influences household welfare outcomes with particular reference to the influence of transfers on conditioned outcomes, such as schooling, health and investment. We do this by examining two innovative cash transfer schemes initiated by the Mexican government in the last decade: PROGRESA, which is a national antipoverty scheme directed at chronic rural poverty, and PROCAMPO, which is a scheme designed to compensate farmers for the negative price effects of NAFTA. The schemes differ in that PROGRESA is targeted at women and conditioned on schooling and health outcomes and PROCAMPO is generally targeted at men and conditioned on land use. The analysis of data collected for an evaluation of PROGRESA suggest that the overall effects of the programs, as measured by total and food consumption expenditure, are not different. However, PROGRESA leads to greater schooling expenditure and school attendance as well as increased health outcomes. On the other hand, PROCAMPO is found to lead to increased investment in agriculture. The results suggest that conditionality may have little effect in terms of short-term welfare outcomes, but do influence both longer-term (human capital) and medium term (productive) investment. Policy makers must consider both whether or not conditions should be placed on a program, and the type of condition, depending on what they perceive to be the desirables outcomes of the transfer scheme.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Davis B ; Handa S ; Ruiz-Arranz M ; Stampini M ; Winters P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davis B, Handa S, Ruiz-Arranz M, Stampini M, and Winters P (2002) Conditionality and the impact of program design on household welfare: Comparing two diverse cash transfer programs in rural Mexico. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067971,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586255,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Bolsa Famı´lia\nconditional cash transfer program[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"de brauw_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067979,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586255,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Bolsa Fami´lia, which began in 2003, is now the largest CCT\nprogram in the world, with more than 12 million bene?ciary\nhouseholds in 2012.\"\n\"aged 6–15 years\"\n\"aged 16–17 years[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"de brauw_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":586255,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"a con-\nditional variable payment per child aged 0–15 years, for up to\nthree children, to “poor” households below a per capita\nincome threshold, and (2) an additional unconditional transfer\nto “extremely poor” households below a lower per capita\nincome threshold.

Família conditional cash transfer program on schooling outcomes of children aged 6-17. years. Weak aggregate effects mask considerable heterogeneity. Among girls, the program significantly increases school participation (by 8 percentage points) and grade progression (by 10 percentage points), with large, significant effects across both younger and older girls in rural areas but concentrated among girls aged 15-17. years in urban areas. Few significant impacts are found among boys. We discuss implications and potential mechanisms for differential impacts by sex, age, and location.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Brauw Alan ; Gilligan Daniel O; Hoddinott John ; Roy Shalini ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.02.001","Keywords":"Bolsa Família\r\nBrazil\r\nConditional cash transfer programs\r\nEducation\r\nGirls' schooling","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Brauw Alan, Gilligan Daniel O, Hoddinott John, and Roy Shalini (2015) The Impact of Bolsa Família on Schooling.

to') - on the school participation of displaced Syrian children in Lebanon. An initiative of the government of Lebanon, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme (WFP), the programme provided cash for the benefit of children enrolled in afternoon shifts at public primary schools. It was designed to cover the cost of commuting to school and to compensate households for income forgone because children were attending school instead of working. Commuting costs and forgone income are two critical barriers to child school participation. The analysis relies on a geographical regression discontinuity design to identify the impact halfway through the first year of programme operation, the 2016/2017 school year. The analysis finds substantive impacts on school attendance among enrolled children, which increased by 0.5 days to 0.7 days per week, an improvement of about 20 per cent relative to the control group. School enrolment among Syrian children rose rapidly across all Lebanon's governorates during the period of the evaluation, resulting in supply-side capacity constraints that appear to have dampened positive enrolment impacts.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"de Hoop Jacobus ; Morey Mitchell ; Seidenfeld David ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00220388.2019.1687875","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"de Hoop Jacobus, Morey Mitchell, and Seidenfeld David (2019) No Lost Generation: Supporting the School Participation of Displaced Syrian Children in Lebanon.

monthly stipend if their children ages 6 to 15 attended school on a regular basis. The program was implemented across all of Brazil between the years 2001 and 2003, until it was folded into the broader Bolsa Familia program (Lindert, 2005). An original feature of the program is that it was decentralized at the municipal level, entrusting the municipality with roles in the selection of beneficiaries and implementation of the transfers. Expectedly, with decentralization, there can be considerable variation in the quality of implementation of the program and the magnitude of its impact on school outcomes according to municipal characteristics, due in particular to elements of local political economy in decision making. This paper follows on a 2005 report that analyzed the role of municipalities in implementing the Bolsa Escola program (de Janvry, Finan, Sadoulet, Nelson, Lindert, de la Brière, and Lanjouw, 2005, subsequently referred to as the 2005 Report). The analysis was based on a survey of 261 municipalities in four states of the Northeast. In that report, analysis was conducted at the municipal level, focusing on four municipal roles: beneficiary identification, beneficiary selection, monitoring-verification-enforcement of the school attendance conditionality, and implementation of accountability mechanisms through both a short route via a local council and a long route via electoral rewards on incumbent mayors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"De Janvry Alain ; Finan Frederico ; Sadoulet Elisabeth ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"De Janvry Alain, Finan Frederico, and Sadoulet Elisabeth (2006) Evaluating Brazil's Bolsa Escola program: Impact on schooling and municipal roles.

The programme was first piloted in a number of areas in England from September 1999. Evaluating such interventions is of course critical to the shaping of education policy and the effectiveness or otherwise of a conditional cash transfer to 16 and 17 year olds on school dropout rates is of general policy interest to policy makers worldwide. The authors find that the impact of the subsidy is quite substantial, especially for those who receive the maximum payment. The subsidy increases the initial education participation of eligible males by 4.8 percentage points and eligible females by 4.2 percentage points. In the second year this increases to 7.6 percentage points for eligible males and 5.3 percentage points for females, suggesting that the effect of the policy is not only to increase participation, but also retention in full-time education. The initial effects are largest for those who receive the maximum payment although the retention effects are concentrated among individuals who are only partially eligible. The authors estimate that just over half of individuals who stayed in education were drawn from inactivity rather than work. The overall impact of the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) was not diminished when it was paid to the mother rather than to the child, though there is some weak evidence that paying to the child is more effective for those fully eligible whereas the opposite is true for those who are partially eligible. The authors also find that the effect of EMA is largest for children coming from a poorer socio-economic background. Both girls and boys coming from low-income families who qualify for the full EMA payment have very high drop out rates and the EMA has proved especially effective in plugging the dropout gap for this vulnerable group. Appended are: (1) Indicators used in each deprivation score; (2) Sample characteristics; (3) Covariate balancing indicators (best specification): before and after matching; (4) Attrition between wave 1 and wave 2; and (5) Identifying assumptions and Estimation method.

Less evidence exists on the impact on learning and cognitive skills formation. This article contributes by evaluating the impacts of the CCTJuntosin Peru on school progression and performance in standardized test scores. Purpose We investigate the overall impact ofJuntosupon educational outcomes of beneficiary children. Specifically, we address two questions: doesJuntoshave an impact on school participation? Can programme participation be linked to impacts upon cognitive skills? Approach and methods We use a quasi-experimental design that combines kernel matching with difference-in-difference estimation. We rely on data from the Young Lives panel survey and focus on a sample of 3,130 children aged 6-18 years old. Findings The article reports three main findings: (a)Juntosincreases the chances of school enrolment and finishing primary school among children aged 12 to 18 years; (b) there is a positive effect on the transition to secondary school among the same age group, which is, however, only weakly significant at the 10% level; and (c) there is no positive impact on test scores of maths and language development among primary or secondary school-aged children. Policy implications The traditional demand-side focus of CCTs risks neglecting supply factors related to service infrastructure and quality. The article suggests that policy-makers need to study the structural mechanisms behind educational inequalities and integrate CCTs with measures to enhance skills formation for targeted households.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gaentzsch Anja ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/dpr.12468","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gaentzsch Anja (    ) Do conditional cash transfers (CCTs) raise educational attainment?

We develop a theoretical framework of the dynamics of the educational process including endogeneity and uncertainty of school performance. Using a randomized experiment implemented under Progresa, we identify the effect of the program on enrollment and performance in the first year of the program. We find that the program had a positive impact on school enrollment at all grade levels, whereas for performance it had a positive impact at the primary school level but a negative impact at the secondary level. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

examines the impact of Superémonos, a conditional transfer program in Costa Rica, which provides poor families with a subsidy for the purchase of food conditional upon children regularly attending school. Using three different empirical techniques -simple comparison of mean outcomes, regression analysis and propensity score matching- the authors examine the program's impact on school attendance, performance in school and child labor. The authors found strong evidence that the program achieves its goal of improving school attendance and much weaker evidence regarding school performance. The program does not reduce the likelihood that youth will work. These findings are discussed in the context of the results from impact evaluations of other conditional transfer programs.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Duryea Suzanne ; Morrison Andrew ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"academic achievement\r\nchild labor\r\nconditional cash transfers\r\nhuman capital","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Duryea Suzanne, and Morrison Andrew (2011) The Effect of Conditional Transfers on School Performance and Child Labor: Evidence from an Ex-Post Impact Evaluation in Costa Rica. : Inter-American Development Bank, 1-28"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067971,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8068015,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586278,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Argentina[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Edo_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586278,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Child Allowance,\nAUH)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Edo_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067979,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586278,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Child Allowance, AUH), a program implemented in Argentina in late 2009,\"\n\"The AUH is a massive conditional cash transfer program (CCT) targeted at children under 18 years old living in poor families with no registered workers in the formal employment sector.\"\n\"The benefit consists of monthly cash transfers per child, and it is paid up to a maximum of five dependent children\"\n\"ash transfers are conditional on\ncomplying with children’s health checkups and school attendance at all compulsory levels.\"\n\"ca[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Edo_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067980,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586278,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"the goal of the AUH is twofold: to provide social\nprotection to the more vulnerable families while promoting the formation of human capital to break\nthe intergenerational transmission of poverty[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Edo_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067983,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8067991,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586278,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"We use microdata from the Permanent National Household Survey (EPH) carried out by the\nArgentinian national statistical office (INDEC).

Schooling of older children, however, still shows room for improvement especially among the more vulnerable. Fortunately, during the last years a sizeable improvement in attendance rates for children aged 15 through 17 took place. This could be related to the 2006 National Education Law that made upper-secondary education compulsory. In this paper, instead, we claim that the Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Child Allowance, AUH) --a massive conditional cash transfer program implemented in 2009 in Argentina-- may be mostly responsible for this improvement. Using a difference-in-difference strategy we estimate that the program accounts for a 3.9 percentage point increase in the probability of attending secondary school among eligible children aged 15 through 17. The impact seems to be led by boys and is more relevant for children living in larger families where the head of household has a lower educational level.

Although the program is not expressly designed to promote a child's cognitive and non-cognitive development, the set of actions carried out by the program could eventually facilitate improvements in these domains. Previous studies on the Oportunidades program have found little impact on children's cognition but have found positive effects on their non-cognitive development. However, the majority of these studies use the average outcome to measure the impact of the program and thus overlook other \"non-average\" effects. This paper uses stochastic dominance methods to investigate results beyond the mean by comparing cumulative distributions for both children who are and children who are not aided by the program. Four indicators of cognitive development and one indicator of non-cognitive development are analyzed using a sample of 2595 children aged two to six years. The sample was collected in rural communities in Mexico in 2003 as part of the program evaluation. Similar to previous studies, the program is found to positively influence children's non-cognitive abilities: children enrolled in the program manifest fewer behavioral problems compared with children who are not enrolled. In addition, different program effects are found for girls and boys and for indigenous and non-indigenous children. The ranges where the effect is measured cover a large part of the outcome's distribution, and these ranges include a large proportion of the children in the sample. With regard to cognitive development, only one indicator (short-term memory) shows positive effects. Nevertheless, the results for this indicator demonstrate that children with low values of cognitive development benefit from the program, whereas children with high values do not. Overall, the program has positive effects on child development, especially for the most vulnerable, who are at the bottom of the distribution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Figueroa José Luis; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.04.044","Keywords":"Child development\r\nDistributional effects\r\nMexico\r\nOportunidades","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Figueroa José Luis (2014) Distributional effects of Oportunidades on early child development.

However, little is known about what features of program design account for the observed outcomes. In this paper we analyze the impact of a program in Cambodia that made payments of varying magnitude to otherwise comparable households. The identification is based on a sharp regression discontinuity design. We find that a modest cash transfer, equivalent to approximately 2% of the consumption of the median recipient household, had a substantial impact on school attendance, approximately 25 percentage points.

Transfers in Rural Nicaragua.pdf","OldItemId":"","Abstract":"This paper will examine the difference in household schooling decisions in agricultural versus other households in rural areas in Nicaragua. The hypothesis is that families involved only in agriculture will experience higher costs and lower perceived returns to schooling than other families and therefore demand less education overall than other families. This paper with also investigate the differences between agricultural and non-agricultural households in the context of the education incentives offered by Nicaragua's Red de Protección Social (RPS). Data analysis indicates a lower initial demand for education but a greater effect of the RPS program on school outcomes among households involved only in agriculture. This suggests that the RPS program created adequate incentives to compensate for the lower perceived net benefits to schooling among agricultural households to change their allocation of resources to increase investments in education.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Ford Deanna B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ford Deanna B (2007) Household Decisions and Conditional Cash Transfers in Rural Nicaragua. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586334,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Conditional Cash\nTransfers[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Galiani_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":586334,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Honduran PRAF experiment[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Galiani_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":586334,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Programa de Asignación Familiar (PRAF)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Galiani_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067986,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586334,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"randomly assigned conditional cash transfers to 40 of\n70 poor municipalities,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Galiani_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067998,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586334,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"randomly assigned conditional cash transfers to 40 of\n70 poor municipalities[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Galiani_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8068077,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586334,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"of a Honduran CCT[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Galiani_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8068300,"AdditionalText":"per child per year","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586334,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"an education\ntransfer of about US$50 per year, for each child between 6 and 12 who enrolled in and regularly[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Galiani_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8068312,"AdditionalText":"strictly speaking is not school tests, possibly school records.

The effects were much larger in the two poorest strata, and statistically insignificant in the other three (the latter finding is robust to the use of a separate regression-discontinuity design).

Despite evidence of these programmes' positive impact on school enrolment, little is known about their impact on school achievement. This study estimated the effect of Familias en Acción on school achievement. It found that the programme has a positive effect on school achievement for children aged seven to 12 living in rural areas. However, the study found a negative effect on the school achievement of adolescents, particularly those living in rural areas. Possible mechanisms of these effects are explored and discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Garcia Sandra ; Hill Jennifer ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/19439341003628681","Keywords":"academic achievement\r\nconditional cash transfers\r\ninternational education\r\nprogramme evaluation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Garcia Sandra, and Hill Jennifer (2010) Impact of conditional cash transfers on children's school achievement: evidence from Colombia.

Micronutrient deficiency and inadequate stimulation are major causes of impaired child development in poor countries. Transfers to households linked to preschool participation may improve cognitive and non-cognitive development in early childhood, but there is limited evidence, and all of it only from Latin America. Using a randomized controlled trial design in Karamoja, Uganda, we examined the impacts of two transfer modalities - cash transfers or multiple-micronutrient-fortified food transfers - linked to preschool enrollment, on a child's cognitive and non-cognitive development. We found that food transfers had no significant impact, but cash transfers led to a significant increase in cognitive measures - about 9 percentage points (and about 0.33 standard deviations) - relative to the control group. We also explored mechanisms and found plausible evidence of the cognitive impacts of cash through both a nutrition pathway (cash improves diet and hygiene, leading to reduction in anemia and improved cognition) and a stimulation pathway (cash increases contributions to preschool teachers, leading to improved preschool capacity and higher preschool attendance, thus resulting in higher quantity and quality of exposure to stimulation). We found that food had no significant impact on these intermediate outcomes. We also considered which contextual factors might lead to its limited effects in relation to cash.</div>\"","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Gilligan Roy ; Shalini  ; Daniel O ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"No DOI","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gilligan Roy, Shalini , and Daniel O (2016) The Effect Of Transfers And Preschool On Children's Cognitive Development In Uganda. : ,  DOI: No DOI"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Programa de Asignacion Familiar (PRAF)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067979,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"PRAF was initiated in 1990 as a social safety net to compensate the poor for lost purchasing power brought about by macroeconomic adjustment\"\n\"It was restructured in 1998, and now includes a reformulated project known\nas PRAF/IDB - Phase II (henceforth referred to as PRAF II)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067980,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The objective of this project\nis to encourage poor households to invest in their family's education and health by\nproviding incentives to increase primary school enrollment, the use of preventive health\ncare services, and the quality of both education and health-care services.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"PRAF II has the following specific objectives: (i) boost the demand for education\nservices; (ii) encourage the “education community” to take part in children's learning\ndevelopment; (iii) instruct mothers in feeding and hygiene practices; (iv) ensure that\nsufficient money is available for a proper diet; (v) promote demand for, and access to,\nhealth services for pregnant women, nursing mothers and children under age 3; and (vi)\nensure timely and suitable health care for PRAF beneficiaries.\"\n\"More generally, the\nobjective of PRAF II is to increase the health and education of Honduran children in poor\nrural communities.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067982,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"To estimate the impacts of both the supply side and the demand side\ninterventions, IFPRI designed an evaluation procedure in which the 70 municipalities\nwere assigned randomly to four different groups, designated as G1 – G4:\nG1 = Demand side intervention only (20 municipalities)\nG2 = Demand and supply side interventions (20 municipalities)\nG3 = Supply side intervention only (10 municipalities)\nG4 = Control group without intervention (20 municipalities).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067986,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"the 70 municipalities\nwere assigned randomly to four different groups[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8067998,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"in which the 70 municipalities\nwere assigned randomly to four different groups,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8068077,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Honduras.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8068292,"AdditionalText":"2 years between baseline and post-test ","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"and the interventions began in 2000.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Glewwe_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":586346,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"The baseline data were collected in 2000 from mid-August to mid-\nDecember.

Bolsa Escola/Familia program on Brazilian children's education outcomes.. Bolsa provides cash payments to poor households if their children (ages 6 to 15) are enrolled in school. Using school census data to compare changes in enrollment, dropping out and grade promotion across schools that adopted. Bolsa at different times, we estimate that the program has: increased enrollment by about 5.5% (6.5%) in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8); lowered dropout rates by 0.5 (0.4) percentage points in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8); and raised grade promotion rates by 0.9 (0.3) percentage points in grades 1-4 (grades 5-8). About one third of Brazil's children participate in. Bolsa, so assuming no spillover effects onto non-participants implies that. Bolsa's impacts are three times higher than these estimates. However, simple calculations using enrollment impacts suggest that Bolsa's benefits in terms of increased wages may not exceed its costs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Glewwe Paul ; Kassouf Ana Lucia; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jdeveco.2011.05.008","Keywords":"Brazil\r\nConditional cash transfer programs\r\nEducation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Glewwe Paul, and Kassouf Ana Lucia (2012) The impact of the Bolsa Escola/Familia conditional cash transfer program on enrollment, dropout rates and grade promotion in Brazil.

paper aims to investigate the influence the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) in Indonesia, on the academic performance of poor students in elementary and junior high school. The design of this impact assessment was based on Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Data was drawn from panel surveys conducted in six provinces in 2007, 2009 and 2013, covering approximately 3,360 villages. Evaluation of the PKH found that it has been able to increase net enrolment rate by 7.1% and the gross participation rate for junior high school students by 7.6%. Nonetheless, PKH has yet to yield significant increases in enrolment and gross participation rate at the primary school level. PKH significantly improves student attendance at the elementary level but, contrarily, has not shown a significant impact on junior high school attendance. PKH delivers significant results in terms of school examination achievement at the junior high school level for Bahasa Indonesia, Mathematics and English, as well as national examinations for Mathematics. However, the basic education in Indonesia is still unable to address issues of the teacher absenteeism (in both elementary and junior high schools) and the lack of quality educational facilities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hadna Agus Heruanto; Kartika Dyah ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/23311886.2017.1295548","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hadna Agus Heruanto, and Kartika Dyah (2017) Evaluation of poverty alleviation policy: Can conditional cash transfers improve the academic performance of poor students in Indonesia?.

Over this 24-month evaluation period households received only 20 months’ worth of payments. There was a long gap in cash payments to households in 2011, followed by a triple payment in February 2012 to settle arrears. Thus, LEAP households did not receive a steady flow of predictable cash with which to smooth their consumption. However the implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) coverage among LEAP households was impressive, with 90 percent of LEAP households having at least one member enrolled in NHIS at the follow-up. Positive impacts on children’s schooling: LEAP has increased school enrollment among secondary school aged children by 7percentage points (pp), and reduced grade repetition among both primary and secondary aged children. Among primary aged children LEAP has reduced absenteeism by 10 percentage points. Despite increased NHIS coverage mixed results on health utilization and morbidity: Despite the large increase in NHIS coverage, LEAP has not had an impact on curative care seeking but has increased preventive care for children age 0-5 in male headed households. Results on morbidity are mixed, increasing for children 0-5 but decreasing for children 6-17. Gender impacts on children: There are some gender differentiated impacts of LEAP on children. Secondary school enrollment impacts are limited to boys, but attendance impacts are bigger for girls. At the household level, impacts on food security and happiness are larger among female headed households. No impacts on consumption: The impact of LEAP on household consumption is essentially zero, likely due to the irregular payments, the lumpy nature of payments when made, and the low level of benefits. Positive impacts on non-consumption: LEAP has led to a significant increase in the likelihood of holding savings (11 pp) and a significant increase in gifts received. LEAP has also had an impact on debt repayments and reduced loan holdings, particularly among female headed households. There are some productivity impacts of LEAP. Among households with four members or less there are positive impacts of own labor supplied to the farm by men and women, and on expenditure on seeds. On the other hand, there are reductions in labor hired in by households though this reduction is lower than the increase in own labor. LEAP appears to be strengthening social networks: The pattern of impacts of LEAP suggests that the program is allowing beneficiaries to re-establish or strengthen social networks. LEAP has had a positive impact on both the value of gifts received and the amount of credit extended to others. LEAP household heads are happier: LEAP has led to a 16 pp increase in household heads who feel happy about their life, especially among female-headed and smaller households. Alignment of results with qualitative study: The qualitative study by OPM (2013) corroborates the positive impacts of LEAP that we find from the quantitative study. These include the findings on increased consumption of fats (palm oil), strengthening of social networks through gifts and transfers, debt repayment, savings, and overall self-esteem, aspirations and happiness. The pattern of impacts revealed here is consistent with the implementation of LEAP. The overall low level of LEAP benefits coupled with sporadic payments and the large lump-sum in February 2012 explains the lack of impacts on consumption and the increase in nonconsumption activities such as savings and reductions in debt. These activities appear to have strengthened the social networks of LEAP households. Implication of results: There are three key issues that arise from the results presented here. First is the low value of the LEAP transfer—this issue has been partially resolved by a tripling of the transfer level from January 2012. Second is the irregular payment cycles which do not allow households to smooth their permanent consumption. This is a key operational bottleneck for LEAP. The third issue is the somewhat inconsistent finding of a strong increase in NHIS coverage among LEAP households but no commensurable impact on utilization of health services or reductions in out-of-pocket health expenditure. This suggests there are weaknesses in linking LEAP beneficiaries to health services which requires further attention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Handa Sudhanshu ; Park Michael ; Osei Darko ; Robert  ; Osei-Akoto Isaac ; Davis Benjamin ; Daidone Silvio ; Alviar Carlos ; Lindsey Julianna ; Mwangi of UNICEF; Jane  ; Gass Graham ; Booth Lucy ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Handa Sudhanshu, Park Michael, Osei Darko, Robert , Osei-Akoto Isaac, Davis Benjamin, Daidone Silvio, Alviar Carlos, Lindsey Julianna, Mwangi of UNICEF, Jane , Gass Graham, and Booth Lucy (2014) Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty Program Impact Evaluation.

the effects of a gender-targeted conditional cash transfer program for girls in classes 6 to 8. It finds that the program is successful in increasing the enrollment of girls in classes 6 to 8 as intended. It also finds evidence to suggest that the program generated positive spillover effects on the enrollment of boys. This success does, however, appear to be poised to come at a cost. The student-teacher ratio in treated districts is also climbing. This suggests that in the absence of active steps to address these increasing student-teacher ratios, instructional quality is likely to suffer. The success of the program appears to be driven by enrollment increases in urban schools. This suggests the need for a reassessment of the targeting criteria in rural schools.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Hasan Amer ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education For All\r\nEducation Reform and Management\r\nPrimary Education\r\nTeaching and Learning\r\nTertiary Education","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hasan Amer (2010) Gender-targeted conditional cash transfers: enrollment, spillover effects and instructional quality.

Programa Nacional de Becas Estudiantiles is a conditional cash transfer program designed to promote human capital accumulation and reduce poverty among Argentine youth. This study follows a 1999 cohort of students for five years and uses matching methods with a comparison group of students excluded due to quotas to estimate average and marginal program impacts. Multilevel methods are used to explore the role of program management and execution in explaining variation between schools in student outcomes.

Estudiantiles is a conditional cash transfer program designed to promote long-term human capital accumulation among Argentine youth and to reduce poverty. This study follows a 1999 cohort of students from 24 schools for five years. Propensity score matching methods are used with a comparison group of students who were excluded due to quotas to estimate the average and marginal impacts of the Becas program. Multilevel methods are also used to estimate the contributions of Becas program management and school characteristics in explaining variation between schools in student outcomes. The results show significant effects of the Becas program in increasing attendance, reducing grade repetition and improving students' performance. The impacts were largest for students who received the scholarship for more than one year, suggesting a dynamic incentive may have been established by linking receipt of the scholarship in subsequent years to students' academic performance in the first year of participation. The multilevel analysis suggested that efforts to strengthen institutional capacity and conditions for learning in the schools and to promote better management and communication also contributed to student performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Heinrich Carolyn ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Heinrich Carolyn (2011) Demand and Supply-Side Determinants of Conditional Cash Transfer Program Effectiveness: Improving the First-Generation Programs.

kindergarten attendance allowance program in Hungary, a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program introduced in 2009 that aimed to increase kindergarten enrolment of disadvantaged children aged 3 and 4. The administration of the program was decentralised, and we make use of the substantial regional variation in program take-up across municipalities to estimate the program's effect on enrolment rates. We show modest, but non-negligible effects, despite problems related to the manner of the program's implementation.

outcomes using experimental data from an unconditional cash transfer program in Malawi. Since households receive the cash and parents are responsible for making spending decisions, we also examine the intervening pathways between cash transfers and child schooling. Data comes from a cluster-randomized study of Malawi's Social Cash Transfer Program (SCTP). After a baseline survey, households in village clusters were randomly assigned to treatment and control arms with treatment villages receiving transfers immediately and control villages assigned a later entry. We test for treatment impacts on a panel of school-aged children (6–17) using a differences-in-differences model. After a years’ worth of transfers, we find the Malawi SCTP both improves enrollment rates and decreases dropouts. The main intervening pathway between the program and schooling is education expenditures, suggesting that the cash improves the demand for education by reducing financial constraints.

However, some sources of income may be more beneficial to children than others. The effects of child support payments from absent fathers on children's achievement test scores and home environments are evaluated using 3 methods to control for heterogeneity among families. The results provide evidence that increased child support payments may improve the academic achievement of elementary school-age children even more than income from other sources. While overall family income appears to affect levels of cognitive stimulation available in children's homes, child support does not have larger effects than other sources of income. Findings suggest that increasing the financial contributions of absent fathers through improved child support enforcement or other interventions may be a particularly beneficial income support strategy for children in single mother families.","Comments":"Copyright - Copyright University of Wisconsin Press Fall 1996 Last updated - 2020-11-18 CODEN - JHREA9 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - United States--US","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Knox Virginia W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"1200:Social policy\r\n9130:Experimental/theoretical treatment\r\n9190:US\r\nAcademic achievement\r\nChild development\r\nChild support\r\nChildren & youth\r\nElementary school students\r\nEmployment\r\nFathers\r\nSociology\r\nStudies\r\nUnited States--US","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Knox Virginia W (1996) The effects of child support payments on developmental outcomes for elementary school-age children.

These programs vary by country but typically make cash transfers conditional upon children meeting certain healthcare and educational standards. While previous research finds that these programs are effective at increasing school enrollment and attendance, there is little evidence that it actually increases academic achievement. This paper examines the impact of Familias en Acción, a CCT in Colombia, on the academic achievement of students from households receiving the subsidies, and the impact of the program on school quality. Program evaluation data is used to conduct a logistic regression to measure the programs effects on literacy and grade retention, and national standardized test results are used to conduct an Ordinary Least Squares Regression on academic performance at the school level. The results show that Familias en Acción increases literacy and decreases grade retention amongst the students receiving the subsidy. While the students participating in the program are not found to have no impact on schools, the overall increase in enrollment does have a negative impact on school level math scores. These findings support the growing use of CCT strategies to increase human capital and alleviate poverty. However, the program still allows for geographic and socio-economic differentials in academic attainment to persist. Additional program options should be investigated to address these concerns.

The main objectives of the initiative, which is operated by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security (MLSS), are to achieve better targeting of welfare benefits to the poor and to increase human capital by conditioning receipt of the benefits on participants meeting certain requirements for school attendance and health care visits. Under the programme, PATH eligibility is determined using a scoring formula which draws on detailed information about household circumstances. Benefits to eligible households are disbursed through the postal system. The conditioning requirements to increase human capital are enforced, based on information which is obtained through schools and health care centres.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Levy Dan ; Ohls Jim ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Levy Dan, and Ohls Jim (2007) Evaluation of Jamaica's PATH Program: Final Report Ministry of Labour and Social Security 14 National Heroes Circle Kingston 4 Jamaica West Indies Project Officer.

Evaluation of Jamaica's PATH conditional cash transfer programme This paper summarizes the findings of an evaluation of the Programme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH), a conditional cash transfer programme implemented by the Government of Jamaica. We find that PATH was generally implemented as intended; exhibited better targeting to the poor than other similar social assistance programmes in Jamaica; and had positive and statistically significant impacts on school attendance and number of preventive health care visits for children. We find no evidence, however, that PATH was able to affect longer-term outcomes such as marks, grade progression, or health care status.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Levy Dan ; Ohls Jim ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/19439342.2010.519783","Keywords":"Jamaica\r\nconditional cash transfer\r\neducation\r\nhealth\r\npoverty","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Levy Dan, and Ohls Jim (2010) Evaluation of Jamaica's PATH conditional cash transfer programme.

paper presents the main findings of a quantitative evaluation of the Red de Protección Social (RPS), a conditional cash transfer program in Nicaragua, against its primary objectives. These included supplementing income to increase household expenditures on food, reducing primary school desertion, and improving the health care and nutritional status of children under age 5. The evaluation design is based on a randomized, community-based intervention with measurements before and after the intervention in both treatment and control communities. Where possible, we erred on the side of assessing effects in conservative manners, for example, in the calculation of standard errors and the treatment of possible control group contamination. Overall, we find that RPS had positive (or favorable) and significant double-difference estimated average effects on a broad range of indicators and outcomes. Where it did not, it was often due to similar, smaller improvements in the control group that appear to have been stimulated indirectly by the program. Most of the estimated effects were larger for the extreme poor. The findings presented here played an important role in the decision to continue this effective program","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Maluccio J A; Flores R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Maluccio J A, and Flores R (2004) Impact Evaluation of a Conditional Cash Transfer Program: The Nicaraguan Red De Proteccion Social. : (FCND Discussion P.

evaluations of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs show positive short-term impacts, but there is only limited evidence on whether these benefits translate into sustained longer-term gains. This paper uses the municipal-level randomized assignment of a CCT program implemented for five years in Honduras to estimate long-term effects 13 years after the program began. We estimate intent-to-treat effects using individual-level data from the population census, which allows assignment of individuals to their municipality of birth, thereby circumventing migration selection concerns. For the non-indigenous, we find positive and robust impacts on educational outcomes for cohorts of a very wide age range. These include increases of more than 50 percent for secondary school completion rates and the probability of reaching university studies for those exposed at school-going ages. They also include substantive gains for grades attained and current enrollment for others exposed during early childhood, raising the possibility of further gains going forward. Educational gains are, however, more limited for the indigenous. Finally, exposure to the CCT increased the probability of international migration for young men, from 3 to 7 percentage points, also stronger for the non-indigenous. Both early childhood exposure to the nutrition and health components of the CCT as well as exposure during school-going ages to the educational components led to sustained increases in human capital.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Millan Teresa Molina; Macours Karen ; Maluccio John A; Tejerina Luis ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/j.jdeveco.2019.102385","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Millan Teresa Molina, Macours Karen, Maluccio John A, and Tejerina Luis (2020) Experimental long-term effects of early-childhood and school-age exposure to a conditional cash transfer program.

The purpose of this project is to experimentally evaluate the effects of this three-year innovative holistic conditional cash transfer (CCT) initiative. This paper presents initial findings from an ongoing and comprehensive evaluation of Family Rewards. It examines the program's implementation in the field and families' responses to it during the first two of its three years of operations, and early findings on the program's impacts on children's educational processes and outcomes. More specifically, this paper addresses the following questions: (1) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on family income, poverty, and financial hardship?; (2) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on use of health care and health insurance?; (3) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on parents' employment and educational attainment?; and (4) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on children's educational outcomes? Overall, this study shows that, despite an extraordinarily rapid start-up, the program was operating largely as intended by its second year. Although many families struggled with the complexity of the program, most were substantially engaged with it and received a large amount of money for meeting the conditions it established. Specifically, nearly all families (98 percent) earned at least some rewards in both program years, with payments averaging more than $6,000 during the first two program years combined. The program reduced current poverty and hardship; increased savings; increased families' continuous use of health insurance coverage and increased their receipt of medical care; and increased employment in jobs that are not covered by the unemployment insurance (UI) system but reduced employment in UI-covered jobs. The program has had mixed success in improving children's academic performance specifically. Contrary to expectations, Family Rewards did not affect school attendance or annual standardized test scores in Math and English Language Arts (ELA) for either group of youngest children, but did lead to notable gains for a group of more academically prepared high school students. The program also had important effects on several key proposed mediators of the intervention. However, these effects vary by parents with different age groups of children.

It conducts a randomised community trial, with baseline and endline surveys of intervention and control households; verifies school enrolment; and completes key-informant interviews and focus-group discussions. Compared with non-beneficiaries, intervention children experienced a 5 percentage point difference in enrolment, higher educational expenditures, fewer absences, and a 10 percentage point decrease in labour outside the home. Qualitative data confirm the quantitative findings. Transfers to poor households had a positive impact.

The program offered cash assistance to low-income families, provided that they met certain conditions related to family health care, children's education, and parents' work. The first version of Family Rewards, called Opportunity NYC--Family Rewards (\"Family Rewards 1.0\"), was evaluated in New York City beginning in 2007 using a randomized controlled trial, in which families were randomly assigned to a program group that was offered the program or a control group that was not. Family Rewards 2.0, the subject of this report, was launched in July 2011 in the Bronx, New York, and Memphis, Tennessee. While still offering rewards in the areas of children's education, family health, and parents' work, Family Rewards 2.0 refined the original model in several ways: it offered fewer rewards in each domain, paid those rewards more frequently, offered the education rewards only to high school students, and offered proactive and personalized guidance to help families earn rewards. The addition of guidance from staff members, who actively helped families develop strategies to earn rewards, represented the biggest change from the original model. This report examines whether those changes led to bigger impacts and whether the program had similar effects in a context different from New York City. The findings show that the new program achieved many of the same effects as the original model, but fell short in other, important ways. Family Rewards 2.0 met its short-term goals of increasing income and reducing poverty, although the effects were smaller, given that less money was transferred overall. The program also increased dental visits and adults' self-reported health status, particularly for those in poorer health at study entry. Similar to the earlier program, the new model led to reductions in work and earnings for some participants. However, the new program did not affect students' school progress through Year 4, neither for the full sample of students nor for a more academically prepared subgroup. Overall, the findings indicate that Family Rewards 2.0 did not lead to bigger or more widespread effects. In addition, the failure to replicate the positive effects on school progress for more academically prepared students suggests that the model's effects on education were not very robust. The following are appended: (1) Rewards Offered in Family Rewards 1.0 and 2.0; (2) Parents' Understanding of and Experience with Family Rewards; (3) Impacts on Public Benefit Receipt; and (4) Impacts on Education Outcomes, by Math Proficiency. [Additional support for the evaluation was provided by the Benificus Foundation, the City of Memphis, and the Women's Foundation of Greater Memphis.]","Comments":"Accession Number: ED569137; Sponsoring Agency: Corporation for National and Community Service; Acquisition Information: MDRC. 16 East 34th Street 19th Floor, New York, NY 10016-4326.

overall goal of this study is to examine if there is a dropout problem in rural China and to explore the effectiveness of a Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programme on the rate of dropping out. To meet this goal, we conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the impact of the CCT using a sample of the poorest 300 junior high school students in a nationally-designated poor county in Northwest China. We find that the annual dropout rate in the study county was 7.8 per cent and even higher, 13.3 per cent, among the children of poor households. We demonstrate that a CCT program reduces dropout by 60 per cent. The programme is most effective among students with poor academic performance, and likely more effective among girls and younger students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mo D ; Zhang L ; Yi H ; Luo R ; Rozelle S ; Brinton C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mo D, Zhang L, Yi H, Luo R, Rozelle S, and Brinton C (2013) School dropouts and conditional cash transfers: evidence from a randomised controlled trial in rural China's junior high schools.

transfer (CT) policy is promoted as an important financial vehicle to address household poverty and bring positive societal development. This study investigates the impact of an unconditional CT policy on children's education outcomes focusing on both the primary and secondary phases of education. We also examine the spillover effect of CT policy on parents' employment. To identify these effects we focus on South Africa and exploit the changes in age eligibility requirements of the CT policy to build credible control and treatment groups based on birth cohort. Our results show that CT policy improves reading and writing abilities at both the primary (by 3.7% and 3.3% respectively) and secondary education levels (by 10.2% and 10.1%, respectively) but it fosters school attendance only in secondary education. We also provide evidence that, for primary education students, the effects are only significant for boys. Notably, the positive effects of CT programs are also confirmed by the presence of spillover effects to other members of the family in our observance of increases in both mothers' and fathers' employment outcomes (by 35% and 34%, respectively). Therefore, in this paper we provide robust evidence that unconditional CT policy supports resilient development of the country's population in several dimensions that go beyond the educational achievement of targeted children.

The evaluation design consists of a randomized experiment for families around the first quintile of the poverty index and of a regression discontinuity design for families around the second quintile of this index, which is the program's eligibility threshold. This allows us to compare results from two different credible identification methods, and to investigate whether the impact varies with families'poverty level. Around the first quintile of the poverty index the impact is positive while it is equal to zero around the second quintile. This suggests that for the poorest families the program lifts a credit constraint while this is not the case for families close to the eligibility threshold.","Comments":"This record includes 2 studies, please focus on the second study, regression discontinuity (RDD), sampling around the 2nd quartile of index of poverty, N=2384 for treatment + control.

The evaluation design consists of a randomized experiment for families around the first quintile of the poverty index and of a regression discontinuity design for families around the second quintile of this index, which is the program's eligibility threshold. This allows us to compare results from two different credible identification methods, and to investigate whether the impact varies with families'poverty level. Around the first quintile of the poverty index the impact is positive while it is equal to zero around the second quintile. This suggests that for the poorest families the program lifts a credit constraint while this is not the case for families close to the eligibility threshold.","Comments":"The study reports on 2 different studies.

This paper presents the first experimental evidence on the effectiveness of conditionality in cash transfer programs for schooling. Using data from an intervention in Malawi that featured randomized conditional and unconditional treatment arms, the authors find that the program reduced the dropout rate by more than 40 percent and substantially increased regular school attendance among the target population of adolescent girls. However, they do not detect a higher impact in the conditional treatment group. This finding contrasts with previous non-experimental studies of conditional cash transfer programs, which found negligible \"income\" effects and strong \"price\" effects on schooling. The authors argue that their findings are consistent with the very low level of incomes and the high prevalence of teen marriage in the region. The results indicate that relatively small, unconditional cash transfers can be cost-effective in boosting school enrollment among adolescent girls in similar settings.","Comments":"The following study has 2 treatment arms: 1) conditional cash transfer, 2) unconditional cash transfer and a control group.

This paper presents the first experimental evidence on the effectiveness of conditionality in cash transfer programs for schooling. Using data from an intervention in Malawi that featured randomized conditional and unconditional treatment arms, the authors find that the program reduced the dropout rate by more than 40 percent and substantially increased regular school attendance among the target population of adolescent girls. However, they do not detect a higher impact in the conditional treatment group. This finding contrasts with previous non-experimental studies of conditional cash transfer programs, which found negligible \"income\" effects and strong \"price\" effects on schooling. The authors argue that their findings are consistent with the very low level of incomes and the high prevalence of teen marriage in the region. The results indicate that relatively small, unconditional cash transfers can be cost-effective in boosting school enrollment among adolescent girls in similar settings.","Comments":"The following study has 2 treatment arms: 1) conditional cash transfer, 2) unconditional cash transfer and a control group.

Using instrumental variable techniques, it estimates the overall impact of Juntos five years after its initial rollout and explores the differential impacts among beneficiaries according to the length of time they spent in the program. In so doing, the analysis explores whether it takes time for the program to make significant and sizable impacts; and whether some impacts change in magnitude the longer the beneficiaries spend in the program. The results seem to confirm both hypotheses: almost all indicators of interest are significantly higher among beneficiaries with longer treatment spells. However, in many cases these improvements are too small to be picked up in the analysis of overall effects, when beneficiaries are compared to non-beneficiaries. These findings suggest that while the program has a non negligible impact on welfare, there is room for improvement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Perova Elizaveta ; Vakis Renos ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Peru JEL Classification: H53\r\npoverty\r\ntransfers","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Perova Elizaveta, and Vakis Renos (2012) 5 Years in Juntos: New Evidence on the Program’s Short and Long-Term Impacts. : , 53-82"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067973,"AdditionalText":"Discussion Papers","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586510,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Discussion Papers,\"\n\"Suggested Citation: Ponce, Juan; Bedi, Arjun S.

These programs aim to influence the accumulation of human capital, as well as reduce poverty. In terms of educational outcomes, a number of impact evaluation studies have shown that such programs have led to an increase in school enrollment, ensured regular school attendance and led to a reduction in child labor. Theoretically, such cash transfer programs may also be expected to exert a positive impact on students' test scores, but related empirical evidence is scarce. Accordingly, this paper evaluates the impact of a cash transfer program, the Bono de Desarrollo Humano of Ecuador, on students' cognitive achievements. The paper uses a regression discontinuity strategy to identify the impact of the program on second grade cognitive achievement. Regardless of the specification and sample used, we find no impact of the program on test scores, suggesting that attempts at building human capital, as measured by cognitive achievement, require additional and alternative interventions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The per grade gains in reducing drop outs cumulate in an additional half a year in total schooling. Progressive impacts are found along three dimensions: degree of poverty, parents’ education and distance to school. The children of uneducated fathers living far from school gain twice as much as their counterparts with an educated father or close to a school. The intervention successfully closes the schooling gap along the wealth dimension but falls short of achieving the same in the other dimensions of parents’ education and school distance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Raymond Melanie ; Sadoulet Elisabeth ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"children\r\neducation\r\nrural poverty","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Raymond Melanie, and Sadoulet Elisabeth (2003) Educational Grants Closing the Gap in Schooling Attainment between Poor and Non-Poor.

In the first year of implementation, I find an increase in attendance among the 16-year-olds of 6 percentage points, with urban boys responsible for most of this, raising their attendance rates by 16 percentage points. I find no change in attendance for the 17-year-olds who had a gap year in treatment: though they had previously had received Bolsa Familia until age 15, they were not eligible as 16-year-olds in 2007 and once again became eligible in 2008. My findings suggest this expansion of Bolsa Familia was sufficient to maintain youth in school who were already attending, but not powerful enough to reclaim drop-outs. Additionally, I find little evidence that Bolsa Familia impacts the adolescents’ time devoted to work and chores.

Cash-transfer programmes can improve the wellbeing of vulnerable children, but few studies have rigorously assessed their effectiveness in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the effects of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) on birth registration, vaccination uptake, and school attendance in children in Zimbabwe. Methods We did a matched, cluster-randomised controlled trial in ten sites in Manicaland, Zimbabwe. We divided each study site into three clusters. After a baseline survey between July, and September, 2009, clusters in each site were randomly assigned to UCT, CCT, or control, by drawing of lots from a hat. Eligible households contained children younger than 18 years and satisfied at least one other criteria: head of household was younger than 18 years; household cared for at least one orphan younger than 18 years, a disabled person, or an individual who was chronically ill; or household was in poorest wealth quintile. Between January, 2010, and January, 2011, households in UCT clusters collected payments every 2 months. Households in CCT clusters could receive the same amount but were monitored for compliance with several conditions related to child wellbeing. Eligible households in all clusters, including control clusters, had access to parenting skills classes and received maize seed and fertiliser in December, 2009, and August, 2010. Households and individuals delivering the intervention were not masked, but data analysts were. The primary endpoints were proportion of children younger than 5 years with a birth certificate, proportion younger than 5 years with up-to-date vaccinations, and proportion aged 6-12 years attending school at least 80% of the time. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00966849. Findings 1199 eligible households were allocated to the control group, 1525 to the UCT group, and 1319 to the CCT group. Compared with control clusters, the proportion of children aged 0-4 years with birth certificates had increased by 1•5% (95% CI -7•1 to 10•1) in the UCT group and by 16•4% (7•8-25•0) in the CCT group by the end of the intervention period. The proportions of children aged 0-4 years with complete vaccination records was 3•1% (-3•8 to 9•9) greater in the UCT group and 1•8% (-5•0 to 8•7) greater in the CCT group than in the control group. The proportions of children aged 6-12 years who attended school at least 80% of the time was 7•2% (0•8-13•7) higher in the UCT group and 7•6% (1•2-14•1) in the CCT group than in the control group. Interpretation Our results support strategies to integrate cash transfers into social welfare programming in sub-Saharan Africa, but further evidence is needed for the comparative effectiveness of UCT and CCT programmes in this region.","Comments":"There are three treatment arms in this study: Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT), Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) and Control.

of vulnerable children, but few studies have rigorously assessed their effectiveness in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the effects of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) on birth registration, vaccination uptake, and school attendance in children in Zimbabwe. Methods We did a matched, cluster-randomised controlled trial in ten sites in Manicaland, Zimbabwe. We divided each study site into three clusters. After a baseline survey between July, and September, 2009, clusters in each site were randomly assigned to UCT, CCT, or control, by drawing of lots from a hat. Eligible households contained children younger than 18 years and satisfied at least one other criteria: head of household was younger than 18 years; household cared for at least one orphan younger than 18 years, a disabled person, or an individual who was chronically ill; or household was in poorest wealth quintile. Between January, 2010, and January, 2011, households in UCT clusters collected payments every 2 months. Households in CCT clusters could receive the same amount but were monitored for compliance with several conditions related to child wellbeing. Eligible households in all clusters, including control clusters, had access to parenting skills classes and received maize seed and fertiliser in December, 2009, and August, 2010. Households and individuals delivering the intervention were not masked, but data analysts were. The primary endpoints were proportion of children younger than 5 years with a birth certificate, proportion younger than 5 years with up-to-date vaccinations, and proportion aged 6-12 years attending school at least 80% of the time. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00966849. Findings 1199 eligible households were allocated to the control group, 1525 to the UCT group, and 1319 to the CCT group. Compared with control clusters, the proportion of children aged 0-4 years with birth certificates had increased by 1•5% (95% CI -7•1 to 10•1) in the UCT group and by 16•4% (7•8-25•0) in the CCT group by the end of the intervention period. The proportions of children aged 0-4 years with complete vaccination records was 3•1% (-3•8 to 9•9) greater in the UCT group and 1•8% (-5•0 to 8•7) greater in the CCT group than in the control group. The proportions of children aged 6-12 years who attended school at least 80% of the time was 7•2% (0•8-13•7) higher in the UCT group and 7•6% (1•2-14•1) in the CCT group than in the control group. Interpretation Our results support strategies to integrate cash transfers into social welfare programming in sub-Saharan Africa, but further evidence is needed for the comparative effectiveness of UCT and CCT programmes in this region.","Comments":"There are three treatment arms in this study: Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCT), Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) and Control.

educational investments. • Proportion of school-age children with uniforms increased by 42 percentage points. • Even after 3 years, more beneficiaries reported school uniforms for children. • The cash transfer did not lead to changes in school attendance. Abstract This paper explores the short and medium term impacts of unconditional cash transfers on school-related choices for children of beneficiary households in Rwanda. We draw on an independent evaluation of the Concern Worldwide Graduation Programme, which supported beneficiaries with monthly cash transfers and livelihood training. Our study finds that the programme enabled poor households to overcome income constraints and, consequently, allowed them to make investments in education. However, since school attendance already exceeded 80 percent at baseline due to the government's focus on universal access to basic education, the programme was unable to induce additional educational access.

There is relatively little evidence, however, of ongoing effectiveness several years after they have begun. Such evidence is particularly relevant for policymakers because programme effects may become larger or smaller over time. We analyse whether children exposed since birth to a CCT in El Salvador have better schooling outcomes at initial school ages. The results demonstrate that exposure significantly increased school enrolment and attainment for five-year-olds in preschool. The pattern of impacts suggests continued programme exposure might be improving primary school readiness or shifting norms around child investment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sanchez Chico ; Ana  ; Macours Karen ; Maluccio John A; Stampini Marco ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/19439342.2020.1773900","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sanchez Chico, Ana , Macours Karen, Maluccio John A, and Stampini Marco (2020) Impacts on school entry of exposure since birth to a conditional cash transfer programme in El Salvador.

The empirical analysis uses the exogenous variation in the program's age eligibility to evaluate the impact of the grant on school attendance employing cross sectional difference-indifference estimation. The results suggest that grants received by women had a higher impact in children's school attendance than when man received the grant. There is also evidence of a change in gender preference in favour of girls as children get older, when the mother is the caregiver. This suggests that boys face a rising opportunity cost of attending school and that the money received by the grant is not enough to forgo the income of boy's labour activities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Santana Maria Isabel; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Santana Maria Isabel (2008) An Evaluation of The Impact of South Africa's Child Support Grant on School Attendance. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8067971,"AdditionalText":"this is the same data and analysis reported to word bank in 5390131 Schady (2006) this paper is the peer review journal version of the analysis reported to the world bank","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8067978,"AdditionalText":"bono de desarrollo humano (BDH)","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":8067979,"AdditionalText":"cash transfer originally planned to be conditional upon school attendance and other requirements and communicated as conditional by local politicians in town hall meetings and media advertisement -

In country after country, governments have sought to devise effective policies to increase school enrollment. This paper evaluates the impact of a cash transfer program in Ecuador, the Bono de Desarrollo Humano (BDH), on school enrollment. This is a large program -- in 2004, the BDH budget was approximately 0.7% of gross domestic product. Estimates show that program effects on enrollment are only significant among conditioned households. In Ecuador, schooling requirements were announced, but never enforced. The authors conclude that differences in the response to the BDH program between conditioned and unconditioned households are likely to have a causal interpretation. The results for Ecuador suggest that such a strategy may work in the short term -- at least, for that fraction of households that can be convinced there is an enrollment requirement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schady Norbert ; Araujo Maria Caridad; Peña Ximena ; López-Calva Luis F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schady Norbert, Araujo Maria Caridad, Peña Ximena, and López-Calva Luis F (2008) Cash Transfers, Conditions, and School Enrollment in Ecuador [with Comments].

It is the biggest program of this kind in the world, reaching more then 13 000 000 families. The BFP awards grants to eligible poor families, allowing increased consumption in the short term, while building human capital in the long term through setting requirements for school attendance and health care. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of these transfers on educational outcomes in 2004 and 2006, as well as heterogeneous treatment effects over age, region, gender and area (rural/urban). Using Propensity Score Matching (PSM), we find that the probability of school enrollment rises by around 4 percentage points for recipients' children. The effect is higher for younger children, as well as children living in less developed regions (north and north east) and rural areas. Our results also point to a positive impact on school attendance; recipients miss less school than non-recipient children. However, we also find that this result slightly fades over time.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Schaffland E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schaffland E (2012) Conditional Cash Transfers in Brazil: Treatment Evaluation of the “Bolsa Família” Program on Education. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8934337,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":586528,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"This paper analyzes the impact on school enrollment of a school subsidy program in poor rural\ncommunities in Mexico called Progresa.

Poor children who reside in communities randomly selected to participate in the initial phase of the Progresa are compared to those who reside in other (control) communities. Pre-program comparisons check the randomized design, and double-difference estimators of the program's effect on the treated are calculated by grade and sex. Probit models are also estimated for the probability that a child is enrolled, controlling for additional characteristics of the child, their parents, local schools, and community, and for sample attrition, to evaluate the sensitivity of the program estimates. These estimates of program short-run effects on enrollment are extrapolated to the lifetime schooling and the earnings of adults to approximate the internal rate of return on the public schooling subsidies as they increase expected private wages. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

PROGRESA is a new program of the Mexican government aimed at alleviating extreme poverty in rural areas. It combats the different causes of poverty by providing cash benefits that are targeted directly to households on the condition of children attending school and visiting health clinics on a regular basis. Some of the questions addressed are as follows: Does the program reduce child labor? Does it increase participation in school activities? Does the latter occur at the expense of children's leisure time? And how do the effects of the program vary by age group and gender? Our empirical analysis relies on data from a quasi-experimental design used to evaluate the impact of the program involving a sample of communities that receive PROGRESA benefits (treatment) and comparable communities that receive benefits at a later time (control). We estimate the effect of “treatment on the treated” using both double-difference and cross sectional difference estimators. Our estimates show significant increases in the school attendance of boys and girls that are accompanied by significant reductions in the participation of boys and girls in work activities. We also find that the program has a lower impact on the incidence of work for girls relative to boys.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Skoufias Emmanuel ; Parker Susan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Children Mexico.\r\nFCND\r\nIncome Mexico.\r\nPoverty.\r\nPublic health.\r\nTransfer payments.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Skoufias Emmanuel, and Parker Susan (2001) Conditional cash transfers and their impact on child work and schooling.

While numerous rigorous impact evaluations have shown that they have been successful in increasing school enrollment and attendance, the evidence on learning achievement is still mixed, and there are no studies that analyze the effect on school placement. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that the Programme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH), Jamaica’s CCT program, contributes to breaking the intergenerational poverty cycle by placing its urban beneficiaries on a higher educational trajectory. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that PATH urban male beneficiaries who sat the Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) over the period 2010–14 performed better on the test (scoring 22.48 points, or 5.1%, higher than non-beneficiaries); consequently, they were placed in better secondary schools (7.2 percentiles higher in a national school ranking based on preprogram GSAT scores). In contrast, we find no significant impact on aspirations or on any outcome indicators for urban girls. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first in the literature to take a comprehensive look at the impacts of a CCT program on educational aspirations, school performance, and placement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Stampini Marco ; Martinez-Cordova Sofia ; Insfran Sebastian ; Harris Donna ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.08.015","Keywords":"Jamaica\r\nProgramme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH)\r\nconditional cash transfers (CCTs)\r\neducational aspiration\r\nschool performance\r\nschool placement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Stampini Marco, Martinez-Cordova Sofia, Insfran Sebastian, and Harris Donna (2018) Do Conditional Cash Transfers Lead to Better Secondary Schools?

paper uses exogenous variation in eligibility and grant take-up to evaluate the impacts of the Child Support Grant, an unconditional cash transfer program in South Africa, over the period 2002-2005. I find that increased probability of receiving a Child Support Grant is associated with increased school attendance, decreased child hunger, and increased broad labor force participation, while it has no identifiable effect on narrow labor force participation or employment. The magnitude of these effects is economically significant: most notably, grant receipt appears to decrease the probability that a schoolage child is not attending school by over half. Although not strictly comparable, this effect is actually larger than Skoufias (2001) measures for Progresa transfer program in Mexico, which conditions grant payment on child school attendance. These results are robust across different specifications, but the CSG’s effects appear to be most positive among mothers living in informal dwellings and mothers and household heads with less education. Although the grant’s impact on school attendance is the same for boys and girls, the effect is much larger for children that are living with their mother. The CSG has its effect on school attendance almost entirely on the child who receives the grant, rather than being spread equally among all children in the household, which suggests that grant income is not pooled with other household income sources, contrary to previous studies conducted on the Old Age Pension","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Williams M J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Williams M J (2007) The Social and Economic Impacts of South Africa's Child Support Grant. : , "}]}
