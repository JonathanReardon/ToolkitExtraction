A control group recieved no instruction in the traits of idea and content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency and conventions while the experimental group did receive instruction. Writing samples were taken from both groups prior to instruction. Instruction lasted approximately one semester. Another sample was taken in January. Students at Wichita State University scored all of the samples, and then pre and posttest scores were compared for the two groups.

All students in this class were brought to an 85% correct level of achievement in each unit (85ML Class). The second strategy was a mastery learning strategy (see above) in which all students were brought to a 75% correct level of achievement in each unit (75ML Class). The third strategy was a conventional teaching-learning strategy in which students read the programmed text on each unit, were given a test over that unit, and moved on to the next unit (CONV Class). Students learned three sequential units of matrix arithmetic in a programmed text format. The material was developed by Block (1970). Prior to the experiment, students were administered a pre-test on matrix arithmetic. Further, prior to each learning unit students were asked how interesting they thought the unit would be and how well they thought they would do on the unit. The experiment proceeded as follows. All three classes read unit one of their programmed texts. After they had finished they took a formative test. After the formative test was corrected, those students in the 75ML and 85ML classes who did not attain their appropriate per cent correct were given additional time and help in order to correct their mistakes. The conventional class, on the other hand, was finished with that particular unit. After the students in the two mastery classes corrected their mistakes, they were given a review test over the number of problems that they had incorrect initially which, when done correctly, would bring them up to the criterion level. The learning proceeded in the same manner for all three units. Each day one, and only one, unit was covered. Following the experiment, a summative post-test was given to all three classes. In both the naturalistic and the experimental study achievement was measured by tests based on the content which was covered during the period of time during which the study was conducted. When corrected multiple correlations were used to investigate the relationship of the composite of the antecedent variables and time-on-task, the antecedent variables account for between 25% and 67% of the variation in time-on-task. Since, however, only one, or at most two, of the three antecedent variables could be corrected for attenuation before being placed in the multiple regression analysis it is believed that the findings represent an underestimate of the relationship between the antecedent variables and time-on-task.

Subjects were 89kindergarten students whose primary language was English, and whose performance on the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts was within the average range chosen from classes in a predominantly low income NewYork City school district. Nine relational concepts were selected forCAI over a six-week period, and three conditions of computer-generated feedback--textual, symbolic, and pictorial--were presented to the experimental groups. A control group participated in a color matching game on the computer. Motivational effects were measured by time and trials-to-criterion on the computer, and the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts was used to measure the immediate and delayed effects of CAI on the children's level of knowledge of basic relational concepts. Results indicated that, although children's performance across experimental groups was significantly better than the performance of the control group, there were no significant differences in performance among the feedback groups.

The six traits are  (1) ideas  (2) organization  (3) voice  (4) word choice  (5) sentence fluency  and (6) conventions. For the last 4 years, the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory has been training teachers to teach students to be assessors of writing using the same six traits. This study was conducted to investigate the usefulness of this approach. Six classrooms of fifth graders participated, 67 in the treatment (integration) group and 65 in the control (observation) group. Teachers were taught scoring strategies and were visited by project staff to assist in implementing them. Pretest scores were very similar for both groups. The treatment group gained the most on those traits receiving the most emphasis in instruction, in proportion to the amount of time spent on them and in the order in which they were introduced  their performance on other traits improved slightly.

Students involved in the study were third graders from a typical elementary school. Students who were identified special education students or who achieved an eighty percent mastery of the learning task as of the fourth, and last, posttest were excluded from the study. The computerized drill and practice was provided to the students over a two month period after regular classroom teachers instructed the students in multiplication facts based on addition skills already possessed by the students. Commercially available software was modified to provide the experimental treatments. Three levels of informational feedback  no feedback, knowledge of results only, and knowledge of results plus a corrective procedure leading the student to the correct response, were crossed with two levels of social reinforcement  no reinforcement and twenty percent variable ratio praise following correct student responses. A posttest-only experimental design employed a four minute, ninety item speed test given after each set of two iterations of the three hundred item drill and practice program. Learning progressed steadily throughout the experiment for all six treatment groups, and learning curves generally had low probabilities that their slopes could be zero. Inspection of these learning curves showed the feedback treatments clustered by levels while the reinforcement treatments did not. Analysis of variance revealed that a main effect developed for the feedback variable by the fourth posttest, which was reanalyzed using only feedback levels in the model. No such effect appeared for the reinforcement variable and there were no significant interactions. Planned comparisons of group means revealed that both knowledge of results in combination with the corrective procedure and no feedback produced significantly superior achievement than knowledge of results alone. While knowledge of results plus corrective procedure was superior to no feedback, the results did not reach significance.

However, students often encounter reading difficulties due to the lack of background knowledge and proper reading strategy. Unfortunately, print text provides very limited assistance to one's reading comprehension through its static knowledge representations such as symbols, charts, and graphs. Integrating digital materials and reading strategy into paper-based reading activities may bring opportunities for learners to make meaning of the print material. In this study, QR codes were adopted in association with mobile technology to deliver supplementary materials and questions to support students' reading. QR codes were printed on paper prints to provide direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questions. Smartphones were used to scan the printed QR codes to fetch pre-designed digital resources and scaffolded questions over the Internet. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of direct access to the digital materials prepared by the instructor using QR codes and that of scaffolded questioning in improving students' reading comprehension. The results suggested that direct access to digital resources using QR codes does not significantly influence students' reading comprehension  however, the reading strategy of scaffolded questioning significantly improves students' understanding about the text. The survey showed that most students agreed that the integrated print-and-digital-material- based learning system benefits English reading comprehension but may not be as efficient as expected.

Previous models of the effects of feedback account for lower-order learning outcomes but do not adequately describe experimental findings for higher order learning. Aims. Based on a connectionist model of feedback effects, this investigation aims to show that feedback that allows only one learner response facilitates proposition specific verbatim encoding, while feedback that requires the learner to try again on error facilitates relational fuzzy encoding. Sample and methods. Volunteer high school students were randomly assigned to one of 5 print-based lesson treatments that consisted of four science expository texts with adjunct inference-level questions covering science principles. The five treatments included delayed feedback, single-try immediate feedback, multiple-try immediate feedback, and two control treatments, questions without feedback, and text only. A post-test given 5 days after instruction was designed to measure both verbatim and fuzzy outcomes. Results. Multiple-try immediate feedback was best for paraphrased post-test questions (fuzzy) and worse for verbatim post-test questions. Conclusions.

37092576,Coe (2011),2011,Report,,"The 6+1 Trait Writing model (Culham 2003) emphasizes writing instruction in which teachers and students analyze writing using a set of characteristics, or ""traits,"" of written work  ideas, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, conventions, and presentation. The Ideas trait includes the main content and message, including supporting details. The model has not been adequately studied using experimental methods. In order to provide evidence on the effectiveness of this approach, the study reported here was designed as a large-scale effectiveness trial (Flay 1986). The study addressed the following confirmatory research question  What is the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement in writing? It also investigated two exploratory research questions  (1) What is the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement in particular traits of writing?  and (2) Does the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement vary according to student gender or ethnicity? Data for the cluster-randomized experimental study were collected from participating grade 5 teachers and students in 74 Oregon schools. The benchmark estimates indicate that use of the 6+1 Trait Writing model significantly increased student writing scores during the year in which it was introduced to schools. After controlling for baseline writing scores, the estimated average score of students in the treatment group was 0.109 standard deviations higher (p = 0.023) than the estimated average score of students in the control group. An intervention with this effect size would be expected to increase the average level of achievement from the 50th to the 54th percentile. The findings remained stable when tested using alternative choices for the analytic sample and the model specification. In addition to the analysis of holistic writing scores, exploratory analyses found statistically significant differences between control and treatment group students on three of the six specific outcome measures of particular writing traits--organization, voice, and word choice-- with effect sizes ranging from 0.117 to 0.144 (p = 0.031 to 0.018). For the other three traits  ideas, sentence fluency, and conventions, the mean outcome score of students in the treatment condition was higher than that of students in the control condition, but these differences were too small to be considered statistically significant given the size and sensitivity of the experiment.

This study was conducted in 1978 on a group of 120 subjects who were identified as special education students and on another group of 180 subjects who were identified as regular education students. In the special education population 60 subjects were treated using precision teaching procedures. An additional 90 subjects in the regular education group received the treatement. These students were compared to control groups of 60 and 90 students for the special and regular education populations respectively. Procedures included  (1) screening and identification using standardized tests and one-minute probes, (2) remediation utilizing the building of basic tool skills with one-minute practice sheets and, (3) the employment of direct and daily measurement as a technique for monitoring student performance. The experimental and control students in both populations were compared on a pre, post 1 and post 2 design to determine program effectiveness over the regular school year and the summer vacation period. The results of the study indicated a significant difference in favor of the experimental group over the control group on the variable of math probes on the post 1 testing for the special education population. No significant differences were observed for the auditory and visual areas. The results of the study also indicated that student self-concept and anxiety levels between the experimental and control groups were not significantly different for either the special and regular education population.",['Feedback'],NA,,"['Page 10:\n[¬s]""The sample included a total of 186 first and sixth grade students in regular education[¬e]""']",186,,['Mixed gender'],NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,['No SES/FSM Information Provided'],,NA,96,,NA,90,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,96,,NA,90,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['Yes'],NA,table 10,,NA,at post test 2 11 out of 96 or 11%,,NA,5% Posttest 1 11% posttest 2,

40294902,Ehlinger (1988) FB,1988,Dissertation,,"Research in reading comprehension and reading strategies suggests that cognitive modeling by teachers is an effective instructional tool to teach reading comprehension processes. However, despite evidence suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach, little is known about how teachers most effectively model these processes and how students are influenced by modeled strategies. A Social Cognitive Theory of Learning was used as a theoretical basis for this investigation which was designed to address two major questions  (1) What are the relative merits of characteristics of general modeling when applied to cognitive modeling of reading comprehension processes? (2) How do the characteristics of modeling, when applied to cognitive modeling of reading processes, influence the comprehension and comprehension monitoring of eighth grade readers? One hundred average eighth grade readers were randomly assigned to one of four modeling conditions  (1) Passive Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling only. (2) Active Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling with statements to explain the functional value of the modeled strategy and to foster self-efficacy in the students. (3) Full range Cognitive Modeling. Modeling same as ""active"" group with feedback, (4) Control. No modeling. Students met with the researcher in small groups for three sessions. Each session consisted of the researcher's verbal cognitive modeling of a passage being read, followed by the students individually applying the modeled strategy to another passage, followed by an oral retelling of the passage and comprehension questions. Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance for oral retelling scores and for comprehension question scores, and with a chi-square for strategy use. Strategies were predetermined or emerged from qualitative analysis of the think-aloud protocols. Results revealed  (1) There were significant differences among groups for use of reading comprehension monitoring strategies (p $<$.05). The modeling conditions did significantly more monitoring of their comprehension by applying the modeled strategies and by using their own un-modeled strategies. (2) There were significant differences among groups for reading comprehension based on oral retellings (p $<$.05).

37061114,Elliot (1986),1986,Dissertation,,"The purpose of this study was to investigate use of the microcomputer to enhance poor readers' comprehension of text. The study focused on two text-centered comprehension strategies, questions interspersed in text and immediate feedback, which were used in conjunction with computer-presented passages. The feedback capability of the computer was of primary interest, and was demonstrated by providing feedback regarding students' answers to interspersed questions. Poor readers were used as subjects because of indications from prior research that they are less able to organize text and to monitor their performance during reading than are good readers, suggesting that poor readers may benefit from externally-provided comprehension aids. There were three experimental groups  (a) a text-only group which read computerized text without interspersed questions or feedback, (b) a group reading the text with interspersed questions, but without feedback, (c) a group receiving feedback in addition to interspersed questions. Subjects were 66 sixth and seventh graders reading one to two years below grade level, who were randomly assigned to treatments. All subjects read 250-word expository passages, one science-related and one social studies-related. Re-reading of relevant portions of passages after answering interspersed questions was permitted. A cloze test and multiple-choice test consisting of factual and inferential questions were administered after each passage. The following relationship among groups was predicted for each of the four dependent variables (cloze, multiple-choice test, factual questions, inferential questions)  Group 1 < Group 2 < Group 3. A series of four 3 (type of presentation) x 2 (type of passage) ANOVAS with repeated measures on passages was performed. Study results failed to confirm the predicted relationships, as no significant differences were found among treatment groups for any of the dependent variables. Additional results showed that subjects did little re-reading of text and spent about half the time reading feedback as was expected. The latter finding may have contributed to the lack of significant results. It was concluded that poor readers will not necessarily be motivated to read all material presented to them on a microcomputer.

Two hundred forty students were randomly selected out of four randomly selected schools. Within each school the subjects were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. Four teachers were randomly selected to teach six consecutive English units. The students in each school were instructed together, then they returned to three separate classrooms where they were assigned identical work sheets. Group 1. When all questions were answered the correct answers were read immediately. Group 2. When all questions were answered, the group leader read the correct answers, then he checked the worksheets. While collecting the sheets the group leader dispensed tokens whose number depended on the number and value of correct responses. Students were then allowed to exchange tokens/or reinforcers. Group 3. After the questions were answered, the students were allowed to leave. A criterion referenced test was developed and validated (Pophan, 1978). The test was analyzed with a 2 x 3 factorial analysis of variance design. When appropriate the Tukey method (Winer, 1971) was used. In both settings (rural and urban) immediate knowledge of results groups achieved significantly higher than the control groups. The combination of immediate knowledge of results and a token economy group, achieved significantly higher than both the immediate knowledge of results and the control groups. No significant differential effects on English language achievement of urban and rural students as a function of their participation in different reinforcement strategies was found.

37092584,Holman (2011),2011,Dissertation,,"In an ex post facto causal-comparative research design, this study investigated the effectiveness of Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) programs on raising the student writing achievement. Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) writing achievement scores from the 2010 administration were utilized for this study. The independent variable for the study was the usage of an AWE program. The dependent variable for the study was TCAP writing achievement scores. In this study, the TCAP writing achievement scores of two groups of eighth grade students from each school were analyzed and compared. School A was the experimental group that received AWE as a treatment, and School B was the control group that did not utilize AWE as part of its writing instruction. Both schools were from similar demographic backgrounds. This study took place in rural, upper middle Tennessee. Four research questions with corresponding null hypotheses guided this study. The first three null hypotheses related to the following variables  comparison of control group and experimental group, economically disadvantaged students, and gender. For these three null hypotheses, an ANCOVA test was performed at the 0.05 level of significance. The covariate for these tests was pre-test data. The first null hypothesis dealt with the comparison of the experimental group and the control group and was rejected due to the statistically significant difference in TCAP writing scores. The second and third null hypotheses dealt with economically disadvantaged students and the gender of students, respectively, with the use of AWE. Both of these null hypotheses were retained due to no statistically significant difference in TCAP writing scores between the comparison groups. The last null hypothesis pertained to special education students and the use of AWE. Nonparametric tests were utilized for this subgroup with no statistically significant difference being found between these two groups. Therefore, the fourth null hypothesis was retained. From the study, one may conclude that students who participate in AWE programs do increase in writing achievement more than students who do not participate in AWE programs as part of their writing instruction. One recommendation for practice is that teachers should understand the value of AWE programs when working with students of different ability levels. A recommendation for further research is that a longitudinal study should be considered to evaluate the long-term results and transferability of writing skills.",['Feedback'],NA,,NA,160 students (80 students from School A- treatment group and 80 students from School B- control group),,['Mixed gender'],"['Page 67:\n[¬s]"" 78 54.5[¬e]""', 'Page 70:\n[¬s]"" 5 29.4[¬e]""']",F - 83 out of 160,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,"['Page 63:\n[¬s]"" There were 80 participants at each school.[¬e]""']",80,,NA,80,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['Yes'],"['Page 73:\n[¬s]""School A Treatment 75""\n""School B No Treatment 65[¬e]""']",NA,,NA,6.25,,NA,12.5%,

37092585,Jewell (2003),2003,Dissertation,,"This dissertation investigated the utility of curriculum-based measurement (CBM) writing indices to monitor student progress and serve as an academic intervention. The participants were 257 third-, fifth-, and eighth-grade students from regular and special education. These students were divided into three experimental groups which received CBM writing probes at the beginning and end of the 12-week study (control group), on a weekly basis (weekly group), or on a daily basis (daily group). Students'' writing samples were scored using production-dependent (Total Words Written, Words Spelled Correctly, and Correct Writing Sequences), production-independent (Percentage of Words Spelled Correctly and Percentage of Correct Writing Sequences), and accurate-production (Correct Minus Incorrect Writing Sequences) CBM indices, and an analytic scoring system. Students'' scores on the writing portion of the Illinois Standards Achievement Test were also recorded. The data were used to answer four primary research questions. First, of the various CBM written expression scoring indices, which measures were most appropriate for students of different ages? Second, did more frequent administration of CBM writing probes affect students'' writing skills? Third, did the use of CBM written language probes have a differential effect on the writing achievement of students of different educational classification or gender? Fourth, what was the relationship between students'' scores on the CBM indices and the ISAT? This dissertation found that the production-independent scoring measures were not sensitive to student gains  however, the production-dependent and accurate-production scoring measures were equally as capable of monitoring increases in students'' scores over time. The results of the present study indicated that the students who generated more frequent writing samples generally did not have higher scores than the control students at the end of study. The present study also found that over time, students in special education had similar rates of gain on the CBM scoring indices as students in regular education. Additionally, it was found that girls had significantly higher scores on the majority of CBM indices and the ISAT Total Writing subtest than boys.

Performance indicators such as the TIMSS-R (1999) and NAEP (2000) reports suggest that U.S. students have not yet reached that goal. This study intended to learn how specific assessment strategies might contribute to improved student performance in science. This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of formative assessment with reflection on students' motivational beliefs, self-regulatory skills, and achievement in elementary science. The study aimed to find out whether and how classroom applications of formative assessment during science instruction might influence fifth-grade students' attitudes and self-perceptions about science learning, self-regulatory learning behaviors, and achievement. To explore the effects of the assessment intervention, the study utilized a mixed methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative investigations of treatment and control groups during a four-week intervention period. Quantitative measures included student selfreport surveys administered pre- and post-treatment and an end-of-unit science test. Qualitative measures included classroom observations, student interviews (posttreatment), and a teacher interview (post-treatment). Findings indicated that the fifth-grade students in this study had positive attitudes toward science and high levels of self-efficacy for science. Results suggested that these elementary students employed a wide variety of cognitive and metacognitive strategies to support science learning. Findings revealed that these fifth graders believed formative assessment with reflection was beneficial for science learning outcomes. Research results did not show that the formative assessment intervention contributed to significant differences between treatment and control groups. However, the data revealed different levels of academic achievement and self-regulation for students in specific instructional services subgroups (i.e.. gifted, regular education, special education, and ESL). For example, high achieving students reported higher levels of self-regulatory learning behavior than other fifth grade students. Findings suggested that elementary science instruction that includes classroom applications of formative assessment with reflection may provide support for science learning and the development of self-regulatory learning behavior.

This article presents a quasi-experiment that evaluates whether ASSISTments use has an effect on improving middle school students' year-end test scores. The data was collected from 1240 seventh graders in three treatment schools and one comparison school. Post-test (7th grade year-end test) results indicate, after adjusting for the pre-test (6th grade year-end test), that students in the treatment schools significantly outperformed students in the comparison school and the difference was especially present for special education students. A usage analysis reveals that greater student use of ASSISTments is associated with greater learning consistent with the hypothesis that it is useful as a tutoring system. We also found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that teachers adapt their whole class instruction based on overall student performance in ASSISTments. Namely, increased teacher use (i.e., having more students use the system more often) is associated with greater learning among students with little or no use, suggesting that those students may have benefited from teachers adapting their whole-class instruction based on what they learned from ASSISTments use reports.

One programme involved teacher-directed instruction of declarative meta-cognitive knowledge (Reading Detectives  Ruhl & Souvignier, 2006). The other aimed at improving executive meta-cognition by guided practice  students worked with a computer program based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) (conText) and received immediate feedback on written summaries. Although both groups improved their strategy knowledge to the same extent, the conText group showed a greater improvement in reading comprehension. These findings suggest that guided practice, which is characterised by intensive practice and individualised corrective feedback, is superior to explicitly teaching strategy knowledge.

In other cases, particularly when the response required of S is based on direct recall rather than recognition, the desired answer is given to provide S with a standard against which to compare his response. In the latter type, both self-teaching textbooks and teaching machines have been used as the media for the presentation of self-instructional materials. It is believed that by utilizing self-teaching materials, a student may proceed at his own rate, and that he is in no way restricted by the rate at which his peers learn the same material. As a corollary, it is believed that most students can learn a greater amount when using auto-instructional materials ad libitum than they can in 'lock-step' instruction. The question explored by the third study to be reported is  how is the rate of presentation of materials related to the acquisition and retention of the information presented?",['Feedback'],NA,,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" 28 sixth-grade students [¬e]""']","Experimental = 14, Control = 14 (Table 2)",,['Mixed gender'],"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" equal numbers of boys and girls in each group[¬e]""']",50% female,,NA,NA,NA,NA,['No SES/FSM Information Provided'],,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""14[¬e]""']",14,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""14[¬e]""']",14,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""14[¬e]""']",14,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""14[¬e]""']",14,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,NA,0%,,NA,0%,

A total of 145 students in the fourth and fifth grades participated in this investigation. The students were randomly assigned within grade level into three groups  the reviewers, the readers, and the control group. All students responded to two persuasive topics in their homerooms. Those essays served as pretests and were administered on two consecutive days. On the third day, all students received training in evaluation criteria that were based on the elements of persuasion. The students were randomly assigned to the three conditions within their grade level and participated in three days of intervention. The reviewers read persuasive essays, evaluated them using the evaluation criteria, and gave written feedback to the writer. The group of readers read the same essays as the reviewers, but did not provide any feedback. The control group read books that did not relate to persuasion. For the next two days, students revised their pretest essays in their homeroom classrooms. On the third day after the intervention, all students wrote a persuasive essay on a new topic in their homerooms and revised their essay on the next day  this task was done to examine transfer.

38296661,Rienzo (2016),2016,Report,,"Powerful Learning Conversations (PLC) sought to improve the feedback that teachers give to pupils in Year 9, by training them to apply techniques used in sports coaching. It is based on the idea that feedback in sports coaching is often provided immediately after a task is performed, and delivered in a way that children are more likely to respond positively to. The training programme adopted a 'cascade' model  expert teachers were trained in the approach and then expected to disseminate their training to English and Maths teachers in their school. PLC was developed in the UK secondary school context by the Youth Sport Trust (YST) in collaboration with the University of Exeter. This feasibility pilot study was conducted in 20 schools between January 2014 and November 2014. It had two aims  (1) to explore whether the programme is feasible and ready for a full-scale trial, and (2) to explore the effect on children's attainment and other outcomes of the programme. Key conclusions include  (1) There was no evidence that the programme had an impact on English attainment  (2) The evaluation detected a positive impact on Maths attainment, but this result is not secure and we are not able to draw firm conclusions about the programme's impact  (3) Interviews and observations with teachers found the programme was implemented in different ways and with different levels of understanding in different schools. This could be avoided by ensuring the programme and its underpinning concepts are more clearly defined  (4) The intervention is not ready to be evaluated using a large-scale trial without further development. In particular, it is important that the programme is more clearly defined and less open to interpretation by teachers  and (5) If the programme is taken to a full trial it is recommended that paper-based tests are used. The pilot provided mixed evidence of promise. There was no evidence that PLC had an impact on English attainment. The evaluation did detect an impact on Maths attainment, which was equivalent to six additional months' progress over the course of a year. However, it is important to note that these results, particularly the Maths result, should be treated with caution. The evaluation did not provide evidence of a differential impact on pupils eligible for free school meals or pupils with a low prior attainment. The evaluation provided mixed evidence regarding the programme's feasibility. The training was well attended by teachers and they appeared to be engaged. Nearly all teachers who took part in the training found it interesting, engaging and relevant to their teaching, and believed that their school as a whole would benefit from the programme.

Significantly less attention has focused on the written expression problems of elementary-aged students, which is problematic given that approximately 6% of the school-aged population may have a disorder in written expression (Luttinger & Gertner, 2001). In an attempt to address this problem, the present study examined the effectiveness of a performance feedback intervention in improving the writing fluency skills of a group of elementary-aged students. In addition, this study attempted to examine whether varying the frequency of feedback affected the amount of improvement observed in students' writing fluency skills. A total of 42 students in three third-grade classrooms participated in the study. Each classroom was randomly assigned to one of three conditions  (a) no feedback  (b) performance feedback intervention once per week  or (c) performance feedback intervention three times per week. Growth in students' writing fluency (i.e., total words written, number of sentences, number of letter sequences) as well as spelling was assessed using a time series design. In addition, a prepost cohort design was utilized to assess changes in students' writing achievement on standardized measures. The results of this study indicated statistically significant differences in students' writing fluency growth (i.e., total number of words written) between the three conditions, with students assigned to the performance feedback intervention three times a week demonstrating more growth than the no feedback condition.

38296677,Siddiqui (2014),2014,Report,,"This pilot project focused on improving teachers’ understanding and use of effective feedback. Participating teachers tried to incorporate feedback into their lessons to help pupils understand their learning goals and become able to develop strategies to reach them. The project employed a cyclical action research design, through which teachers reviewed academic literature on effective feedback before developing ways to apply it in the classroom. The project took place over one school year and involved nine treatment and five comparator schools in the London Borough of Bexley. All pupils in Years 2-6 took part in the study. Existing international research suggests that improving the quality of feedback in the classroom has the potential to improve learning significantly. However, studies also highlight the difficulties in improving feedback in practice, and there are few clear examples of how to improve feedback in English schools. This project sought to develop a way of improving feedback led by schools. The pilot evaluation had three aims. First, to assess the feasibility and promise of an approach to improving feedback which required schools to review, understand and apply research findings, including academic papers. Second, to provide formative recommendations that could be used to improve the approach in the future. Third, to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the approach’s impact on academic attainment that could be used to inform any future trial. The approach is feasible and there are some indications of promise. All nine schools completed the action research programme and at the end of the year many staff were receptive and enthusiastic about the approach. A number of good lessons with clear use of feedback strategies were observed. However, in common with existing studies on feedback, there was wide variation in the way that strategies to improve feedback were used. The estimated impact findings showed no difference between the intervention schools and the other primary schools in Bexley in terms of annual progress towards Level 4 at Key Stage 2 or in terms of value-added progress scores. However, due to the non-random nature of the comparison and the small number of schools involved it is difficult to draw conclusions with this. The results should not be confused with those of a full trial. Pupils eligible for free school meals made more progress in participating schools than in comparison schools. However, these findings are based on much smaller numbers and so even greater caution is required.",['Feedback'],NA,,"['Page 24:\n[¬s]""Treatment schools ranged in size from 207 to over 670, with between 3 and 21% FSM-eligible pupils.

Dylan Wiliam and Siobhan Leahy, who are experts in formative assessment, designed the intervention and associated materials. The Schools, Students and Teachers network (SSAT), an independent membership organisation, delivered the project. Schools received detailed resource packs to run monthly workshops known as Teacher Learning Communities (TLCs). Each TLC was expected to last 75–90 minutes. All teaching staff were involved and split into groups comprising 8–14 people. TLC agendas and materials focused on five key formative assessment strategies  ‘clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions’  ‘engineering effective classroom discussions and activities’  ‘providing feedback that moves learning forward’  ‘activating learners as instructional resources for one another’  and ‘activating learners as owners of their own learning’. Within each of these high-level concepts, the TLC handouts introduced multiple formative assessment techniques for teachers to consider. In-between workshop sessions, teachers were expected to conduct peer lesson observations and provide feedback to each other. Each school appointed a lead teacher who attended an initial training day and received ongoing implementation support from an SSAT Lead Practitioner. This included a mixture of visits, phone calls, e-mails, and access to an online community. The project was a randomised controlled trial. It was an effectiveness trial, which tested whether the intervention worked under everyday conditions in a large number of schools. One hundred and forty secondary schools participated during the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 academic years. The primary outcome was Attainment 8 GCSE scores for the 25,393 pupils who were in Year 10 (aged 14–15) at the start of the trial.

37092612,Tomita (2008),2008,Dissertation,,"This study explored the effect of formative assessment on student achievement in science. Research in science education has shown that students enter science classrooms with previously formed explanatory models of the natural world  these naive ""mental models"" have a substantial influence on their learning of scientific conceptions (e.g. Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992). In general, conceptual change describes the pathway from pre-instructional or prior conceptions to a post-instructional or desired conception (e.g. Duit, 1999  Posner, Strike, Hewson, & Gertzog  1982). Conceptual change involves a fundamental restructuring of a network of concepts rather than fitting new concepts into an existing conceptual network or structure (National Research Council, 2007). Research has shown that conceptual change is difficult to promote  for example, students may accumulate multiple conceptions over the course of instruction, including both new misconceptions and more scientifically-sound conceptions. Hellden and Solomon (2004) found that although students tended to evoke the same, less-scientific conceptions over time, they could produce more scientifically-sound conceptions during interviews with appropriate prompting  thus, students undergo conceptual accumulation rather than conceptual change. Students can recall scientifically-sound conceptions they have learned and may use them to reason, but they do so in partnership or hybridization with their less-scientific prior conceptions (Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992). Student achievement in science may be conceptualized as composed of four different but overlapping types of knowledge - declarative (knowing that), procedural (knowing how to), schematic (knowing why), and strategic (knowing how knowledge, applies to particular situation and monitoring progress). These four types of knowledge are distinguishable in theory, and may be assessed by different types of measures (Li, 2001  Ayala, Shavelson, Yin, & Schultz, 2002  Shavelson et al, 2008). As such, it is important to identify achievement goals according to different types of knowledge students are expected to gain and to focus instruction and assessment properly - conceptual change focuses on developing increasingly more scientifically-sound schematic knowledge, whereas gains in declarative or procedural knowledge may be more closely related to conceptual accumulation because it does not involve dramatic changes in schematic understanding. Formative assessment, which focuses on providing immediate feedback by acting upon student understanding during the course of instruction, and conceptual change have both been linked to increased student achievement (e.g. Black & Wiliam, 1998  Wang, Haertel & Walberg, 1993). Formative assessment is an instructional strategy that helps teachers to assess students' current understanding, identify the gap between current understanding and expected understanding, and provide immediate and useful feedback to students on how to close the gap. Formative assessment ranges from formal (e.g. embedded, planned-for interactions between teacher and entire class) to informal (e.g. on-the-fly interactions between teacher and class or student). In this study, the links between formative assessment and conceptual accumulation and conceptual change were explored. Specifically, this study asked  (1) Does formative assessment promote conceptual accumulation, and (2) Does formative assessment promote conceptual change? It was hypothesized that conceptual change-focused formative assessment would foster conceptual change, in addition to supporting conceptual accumulation. It was further hypothesized that all students will show gains in conceptual accumulation as indicated by measures of declarative and procedural knowledge, but that students exposed to conceptual change-focused formative assessment would also show gains in conceptual change as indicated by measures of schematic knowledge or mental models. To research the effect of formative assessment on conceptual accumulation and conceptual change, a small randomized experiment involving 102 middle school students was conducted. In Phase I of the study, 52 6th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group  in Phase II of this study, 50 7th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Both the control and experimental groups in both phases were taught about sinking and floating by the same teacher (the author) with identical curriculum materials and activities. In addition, the experimental group received three sets of embedded formative assessments focused on conceptual change around the topic of why things sink and float during the course of instruction. In Phase I of this study, both groups were kept at the same pace through the entire sequence of investigations. The control condition spent more time on some of the more critical FAST lessons, gathering additional data to support the theories the curriculum expected they would develop at a particular juncture but not receiving structured experiences aimed at addressing misconceptions. In Phase II, students in the control condition spent roughly the same time on each FAST lesson as those in the experimental condition (e.g. they finished the sequence of activities earlier because they did not have class sessions devoted to the RLs inserted at critical junctures) but participated in the formal assessments as a block of activities after they finished the FAST investigations and posttest measures. In other words, in addition to replicating Phase I, Phase II included a Reflective Lesson section for the control group after the end of the experiment proper, followed by a post-posttest. Overall, it was found that embedding conceptual change-focused formative assessments in the FAST curriculum significantly influenced conceptual change. It was also found that all students experienced significant gains in terms of their conceptual accumulation, regardless of exposure to the formative assessments. This study connected two previously isolated but theoretically linked educational frameworks  conceptual change and formative assessment. It was found that formative assessments can be used to promote conceptual change. It was also found that conceptual change is different than conceptual accumulation, in that students who show gains on measures of declarative and procedural knowledge do not necessarily show gains on measures of schematic knowledge.

Teacher-made assessments, in particular, have been underutilized for reforming classroom practice. Yet research has shown that staff development that emphasizes teacher collaboration around formative assessment can be effective in changing teaching practices and improving student learning. This study implemented and evaluated a pilot effort for middle school mathematics teachers along these lines called Formative Assessment with Collaborative Teaming and Support (FACTS). The research focused on whether FACTS led to improved student achievement and whether it changed teacher beliefs and practices. Eleven middle school math teachers volunteered to participate, eight using the FACTS intervention and three acting as an outside control group. The study included 31 classroom sections and 843 students. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used in the analysis. Benchmark tests were given to students three times during the first trimester of a school year. Gain scores, covariance analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling were used to measure treatment effects. Second, participating teachers were surveyed at the beginning and end of the intervention to measure changes in their beliefs and practices. Survey results were compared to national outcomes on similar questions, and treatment groups and individual teachers were compared in terms of pre- to post-intervention changes. Finally, qualitative data gathered during collaboration meetings was combined with post-intervention interviews to help verify results and add context to the study. Overall, the findings for the use of the FACTS intervention were mixed. There was no significant difference in student achievement growth across the treatment groups, indicating that FACTS did not significantly impact student learning. Yet changes in teacher beliefs and practices were found, as indicated by positive effect sizes on measures of assessment beliefs and practices, instructional beliefs, instructional practices, data use, and teacher-to-teacher interaction.

Two procedures that have been commonly used in assessing student achievement are mastery learning and the general outcome model (curriculum-based measurement). Mastery learning procedures monitor progress by assessing mastery on small, successive units of curricula. The general outcome model utilizes the entire year's curricula to assess progress toward the year end goal. Although both methods measure student achievement using current curricula, the general outcome model has been found to be more effective in monitoring student progress to make needed curricular changes. This study compared two procedures utilizing participants enrolled in four second grade classrooms in a midwestern elementary school. Two of the classrooms utilized the Scott Foresman spelling curricula using a variation of mastery learning. The other two classrooms followed that curriculum and also used curriculum-based measurement procedures to monitor progress. The Test of Written Spelling was administered to all participants to assess spelling achievement at the beginning, middle and end of the study. The performance of the two groups was compared on teachers' weekly and quarterly grades, and the Test of Written Spelling.

TuinLEC includes eight lessons distributed in two phases, one for modeling and guided practice, and the second for independent practice. TuinLEC interacts with every student and it provides help and feedback for the task in a game-like environment. Half of the students were taught with TuinLEC, whereas the other half served as the control group. Children in both groups were paired according to reading comprehension scores. We measured students’ reading literacy skills after intervention, which showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group. Students who were taught with TuinLEC were also given a questionnaire measuring satisfaction, usability, and self-efficacy  TuinLEC scored positively in all these measurements.

Feedback was provided on a specific writing task, the short autobiographical narrative. Improvement was measured by scales of the three variables  completeness, development, and length. Three conditions of feedback were provided  quantitative positive student self-feedback through the feedback form, quantitative positive feedback through teacher assessment using the same form, and teacher corrective feedback through written final comments based on the criteria of the feedback form. A control group, no feedback, was included. Subjects were 35 sixth grade students, in two classrooms, randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups.

Two different groups of approximately ten children each participated in each of three separate eight-week intervention phases. For each phase, a comparison group of approximately ten children remained in the regular classroom. Following the intervention, participating pupils were found to spend significantly more time-on-task and to achieve at a significantly higher level in reading than their comparison counterparts.

37092616,Yin (2005),2005,Dissertation,,"This study connected research on formative assessment, motivation, and conceptual change. In particular, it examined three research questions  (1) Can formative assessment improve students' motivational beliefs? (2) Can formative assessment improve students' achievement in science and bring about conceptual change? and (3) Are students' science achievement and conceptual change correlated with their motivational beliefs? Formative assessment in this study refers to assessments embedded in an inquiry-based curriculum. To answer those questions, a randomized experiment was conducted. One thousand and two 6th or 7th graders of 12 teachers in 12 different schools in six states participated in the study. The 12 teachers were matched in pairs and randomly assigned to the experimental and control group. The experimental group employed embedded formative assessments while teaching a science curriculum unit and the control group taught the same unit without formative assessments. All the students were given a motivation survey and one or more achievement tests at pre- and posttest. By comparing the experimental and control students' motivation and achievement scores at pretest and posttest, I examined whether the formative assessment treatment affected students' motivation, learning, and conceptual change. By correlating students' posttest motivation, achievement as well as conceptual change scores, I examined whether students' motivation was related to their achievement and conceptual change. Analyses indicated that, the embedded assessments used by the experimental group did not significantly influence students' motivation, achievement, or conceptual change compared to students in the control group. Most motivation beliefs were correlated with students' achievement in a way similar to what has been reported in the literature. They were not correlated with students' conceptual change scores as hypothesized. Teachers, as well as some contextual factors associated with teachers, were extremely influential on students' motivation, achievement, and conceptual change  teacher effects overshadowed the treatment effect. This study revealed many of the challenges and problems teachers, researchers and randomized experiments are likely to encounter. It also highlighted the difficulty and importance of high-fidelity formative assessment implementation. Finally, it suggested that a cognitive approach in studying conceptual change still has great value to further research.",['Feedback'],NA,,"['Page 159:\n[¬s]"" 280[¬e]""', 'Page 61:\n[¬s]""the teacher participants were nested in either the control group (n = 6) or the experimental group (n = 6)[¬e]""']",280,,['Mixed gender'],NA,Not given,,NA,NA,NA,NA,['No SES/FSM Information Provided'],,"['Page 159:\n[¬s]"" 145[¬e]""']",145,,"['Page 159:\n[¬s]"" 135[¬e]""']",135,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,145,,NA,135,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['Yes'],"['Page 159:\n[¬s]""Pre MC 145""\n""135""\n""Post M C 129""\n""125[¬e]""']",NA,,NA,11.034,,NA,9.285,
37092603,Young (2000),2000,Dissertation,,"The purpose of this study was to explore whether fourth graders could enhance their writing performance by learning to use the criteria in a rubric to assess their own work. Over a four-week period, 304 students were exposed to contrasting writing strategies that focused on three classroom environmental variables  self-assessment with peer and teacher input, multiple practices with teacher written feedback only, and experience in converting the written product into a speech. The writing instruction strategies under study replaced the regular classroom writing instruction two days a week for one-hour periods each day for four weeks. The students were assessed with pre- and posttests in the week prior to and following the intervention, responding to writing prompts similar in genre to the prompts used in the Ne w Jersey state testing program (The Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, ESPA) . A n analysis of covariance (ANCOYA) on posttest results of all three groups showeed a significant improvement in writing F (3,271) = 31.66, p < .05. However, the self-assessment group performed significantly better than comparison groups suggesting that when fourth graders know the criteria by which they are assessed, they can learn to use that knowledge to enhance their own writing.
