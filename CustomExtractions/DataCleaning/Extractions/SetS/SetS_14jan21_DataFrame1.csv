The study finds that elementary school settings benefit students from low social backgrounds, as does having instruction provided by a limited number of teachers.

40642394,Daniels (1961) 1_1,1961,"This investigation seems to indicate that when junior schools adopt a policy of non‐streaming, the result is, on the average, an improvement in the intellectual and scholastic progress of pupils. This increase in ability and attainment is achieved without any noticeable ‘holding back’ of brighter pupils, though it seems true that the main effect of non‐streaming is a radical ‘pulling up’ of the more backward children. These results are in striking contrast with what teachers believe to be the effects of streaming, as shown in Part I of this article. Streaming, most junior school teachers believe, is a method of school organisation which allows children to progress, educationally, ‘at their own natural pace’  bright children are, it is believed, held back by being taught in classes containing duller pupils, whilst duller pupils tend to be overawed, and consequently are retarded, by the presence of brighter pupils in their classes. Consequently, it is widely believed that both dull, average and bright pupils make maximum educational progress when streaming policies are operated. The evidence of this investigation suggests that streaming does not in fact have these effects—rather that the contrary is true.

45336726,Daniels (1961) 1_2,1961,"This investigation seems to indicate that when junior schools adopt a policy of non‐streaming, the result is, on the average, an improvement in the intellectual and scholastic progress of pupils. This increase in ability and attainment is achieved without any noticeable ‘holding back’ of brighter pupils, though it seems true that the main effect of non‐streaming is a radical ‘pulling up’ of the more backward children. These results are in striking contrast with what teachers believe to be the effects of streaming, as shown in Part I of this article. Streaming, most junior school teachers believe, is a method of school organisation which allows children to progress, educationally, ‘at their own natural pace’  bright children are, it is believed, held back by being taught in classes containing duller pupils, whilst duller pupils tend to be overawed, and consequently are retarded, by the presence of brighter pupils in their classes.

In contrast to most previous research on tracking, this analysis compares outcomes in grouped and nongrouped schools. The hypotheses tested here are, first, that ability grouping raises the aggregate level of student achievement and, second, that ability grouping achieves this end by increasing the learning of all students. Comparing average student achievement growth from the seventh to the ninth grades in grouped and nongrouped schools shows that overall gains from ability grouping in either subject are negligible, controlling for differences in student social background and initial levels of achievement. Comparing the achievement growth of nongrouped students and high- and low-group students shows that high-group placement generally has a weak positive effect while low-group placement has a stronger negative effect.

Schools were expected to create classes that contained pupils with a wide range of Key Stage 2 national curriculum results in English and mathematics. Teachers were trained to communicate high expectations of all pupils and to use flexible within class grouping and differentiation techniques. They were asked to minimise the use of marks levels and grades, and to provide formative feedback through comments instead, with a view to creating a growth mindset in pupils. The intervention was developed by a team now based at UCL Institute of Education. The intervention was developed with three schools between September 2014 and July 2015 and piloted with a further eight intervention schools through a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) starting in September 2015 and following Year 7 students for two academic years. The trial was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF).

However, average-ability male students scored significantly better than average-ability female students. Conclusions. Academic performance, as measured by sixth-grade reading scores, was not affected to a statistically significant degree by the instructional approach--homogeneous or heterogeneous--regardless of reading group ability level. Although there was a degree of inconsistency in regard to gender, average-ability male students tended to perform better in reading classes when exposed to heterogeneous instruction and low-ability female students tended to perform better in reading classes when exposed to homogeneous instruction.",['Setting or streaming'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],"['Page 66:\n[¬s]""two middle schools,[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10', '11', '12']",NA,sixth grade - age 11-12,,1,"['Page 66:\n[¬s]""One school fu l ly u t i l ized homogeneous grouping techniques[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 66:\n[¬s]""the other relied on tradit ional heterogeneous grouping prac\xad\nt ices[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 66:\n[¬s]""One school fu l ly u t i l ized homogeneous grouping techniques\nand the other relied on tradit ional heterogeneous grouping prac\xad\nt ices.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,≤1,"['Page 97:\n[¬s]""11""\n""13[¬e]""']",,≤1,"['Page 97:\n[¬s]""14\n6[¬e]""']",,≤2,"['Page 97:\n[¬s]""11\n13\n14\n6[¬e]""']",,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['No'],"['Page 13:\n[¬s]""This study\ncompares the reading comprehension achievement of an experimental\ngroup and a control group.""\n""Nine hypotheses were tested tor three reading group levels:\n(1) high a b i l i t y , (2) average a b i l i t y , and (3) low a b i l i t y .[¬e]""']","the study included three reading group levels - high ability, average ability and low ability - this coding focuses on the low ability group",,Random (please specify),"['Page 71:\n[¬s]""Students in the control group were randomly placed in\nheterogeneous reading classes.[¬e]""', 'Page 71:\n[¬s]""Students in the experimental group\nwere assigned on the basis of I.Q. and reading achievement scores,\nwith teacher recommendations influencing the assignment of a few\nstudents and supporting the others.[¬e]""', 'Page 13:\n[¬s]""This was a quasi-experimental study[¬e]""', 'Page 66:\n[¬s]""two schools were\nselected.
