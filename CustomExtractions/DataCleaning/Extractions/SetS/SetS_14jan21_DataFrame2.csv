Approaches commonly used by the\nsponsors invohed carrying out research projects; making,-displaying,\nand discussing collections; and conducting experiments.\nEach sponsor suggested, directed, and planned. The consultant staff\nand local district teachers helped with the acquisition of materials and\nsupplemented the sponsor\'s activities. A set contact schedule was not\nmaintained. During one month perhaps two to four letters were ex\xad\nchanged; during another month, a meeting, a tape recording, or a con\xad\nversation by ham radio may have been the means of communication.\nThe interaction proceeded as the needs and desires of the sponsor and\nstudent dictated.\nSaturday Class Plan\nIn the Saturday class plan, gifted children were brought together at\nthe headquarters of the county superintendent of schools for three[¬e]""', 'Page 46:\n[¬s]""hours each Saturday to explore fields of their special interests under the\nguidance and direction of carefully selected instructional personnel.\nSmall groups worked in the areas of art, creative writing and literature,\nphysical sciences, mathematics, Spanish, and German. Each child had\nclass sessions in the two subject fields of his choice for approximately\n24 Saturdays. The interests, backgrounds, and aptitudes of the children\ndetermined to a large extent the curriculum.\nEach Saturday class teacher planned and prepared materials to provide\nthe children in his group with enriched learning in the fields in which\nthey were especially interested. The regular classroom teachers per\xad\nmitted the gifted pupils to use free time for research and encouraged\nthem to share experiences on appropriate occasions. In this way, con\xad\ntinuity of learning was provided for the children.""\n""Honors Classes\nHonors courses within the study were offered in the twclf\'h grade\nand were limited to students who were high achievers in particular\nsubjects. The selection for these classes was based upon grades earned\nby the students in the tenth and eleventh grades and upon achievement\ntests in each area. I bis nracticc resulted in the formation of honors\ngroups, w hich, according to the study criterion, included both gifted\nand nongifted children. The offerings within the courses exceeded the\nusual high school offerings in depth. The content included material\nwhich normally would be offered during the two semesters of the\nsenior year plus that of a semester college course.\nStudents in the State Study were involved in both mathematics and\nphysics. The mathematics courses included trigonometry’, solid geom\xad\netry, college algebra, and introductory units in analy tic geometry,\ncalculus, and statistics. Textbooks used in the physics course were those\nfound in college courses. The study of mechanics, heat, sound, light,\nelectricity and magnetism, and modem physics was accompanied by\nsuitable laboratory experiments.\nPart-time Interest Groups\nThe part-time interest group plan was an educational program in\nwhich children in the fifth and sixth grades spent most of the week\nwith their own grade group and one afternoon a week in a special\nclass. During this afternoon they were given the opportunity to explore\nfields of their special interests under the guidance and direction of a\nspecially qualified teacher. The interests, backgrounds, and aptitudes of\nthe children determined to a large degree the curriculum. Subject matter\nwas utilized in such a way as to permit the student to make generaliza\xad\ntions. to relate facts to concepts, and to experiment w ith scientific\nthought and method.[¬e]""', 'Page 47:\n[¬s]""Cluster Grouping\nOuster grouping as part of the study was an administrative plan\nwherein children \'.ere kept with their normal age-grade groups in lieu\nof heing placed in special classes or accelerated programs. It was a plan\nessentially like enrichment in the regular classroom except that the\nschool administration deliberately arranged to place a certain number,\nfrom three or four to no more than ten, in one classroom. Cluster group\xad\nings were established at first, second, fifth, and sixth grade levels.\nAs in the enrichment plan, the teaeher and the curriculum consultant\nplanned for the gifted learners activities that were appropriate for their\ninterests and abilities. These activities were developed within the cur\xad\nriculum of the regular group, with special attention given to providing\nfor the children in the study group learning opportunities that caused\nthe children to extend themselves in order that they would profit fully\nfrom the experiences.
