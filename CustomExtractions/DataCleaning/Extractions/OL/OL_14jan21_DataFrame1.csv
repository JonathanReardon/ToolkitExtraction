38111426,Armstrong (2000),2000,"As national standards in scientific literacy were established by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1993), standardized evaluations revealed that students were experiencing difficulty integrating literacy skills with the reading and writing of content area material (Casteel & Isom, 1994). Further, science teachers are not typically trained to instruct vocabulary development in the content area. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate effects of professional development of an experienced teacher, in an area of vocabulary development in a critical content area. The science teacher received 10 hours of training in specific vocabulary strategies. This training was followed by classroom observations of the science teacher to determine if new strategies for vocabulary instruction were integrated effectively in her content instruction. This study examined the possible impact of instructional modifications on student learning. Examination of the effect on students learning was analyzed by establishing a control and comparison group. The control group received the usual instruction in science and vocabulary a second Vocabulary Enhanced group received normal science instruction that integrated specialized reading vocabulary skills with science terminology. All subjects (46 sixth graders) took a science unit test before and after the 10 weeks of instruction. An analysis of covariance was utilized to compare posttest achievement scores on the science unit test, using the science pretest scores and reading achievement scores as covariates.

39717230,Baker (2000),2000,"The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects on reading achievement of a low-cost, widely implemented volunteer reading program that has been expanding rapidly throughout the state of Oregon. Eighty-four beginning first grade students at risk of reading difficulties were randomly assigned to experimental and comparison groups. Adult volunteers tutored students in the experimental group in 30-minute sessions two times per week in first and second grade. At the end of grades 1 and 2, students were administered a number of standardized reading measures, including measures of individual word reading, reading comprehension, word comprehension, and reading fluency. Analyses revealed that students in the experimental group made greater growth on a word identification measure than students in the comparison condition  they also made more growth than a group of average-achieving students who were from the same classrooms as the students in the experimental and comparison groups. Students in the experimental group also scored higher than students in the comparison condition on measures of reading fluency and word comprehension at the end of second grade. Differences were not statistically significant on passage comprehension. Findings are discussed in the context of the reading achievement effects that other adult volunteer reading programs have attained. We suggest that in establishing adult volunteer reading programs it is important to consider how to balance the intensity of training reading volunteers to achieve measurable impact on reading achievement with real world realities of the volunteer tutoring experience and goals for the extensiveness of implementation.","['One to one tuition', 'Oral language interventions']",NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '8']",NA,NA,,6,"['Page 8:\n[¬s]"".

In grade four, the Total Reading score for the group was significant at p $>$.01, and the Total Language score for the group was significant at p $>$.05. In grade five, the Total Math Score was significant at p $>$.01. There were no statistically significant differences for grade two.

Sixty-six fourth-grade students were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups  (a) a Think-Aloud (TA) group, in which students were taught various comprehension monitoring strategies for reading stories (e.g., selfquestioning, prediction, retelling, rereading) through the medium of thinking aloud  (b) a Directed Reading-Thinking Activity (DRTA) group, in which students were taught a predict-verify strategy for reading and responding to stories  or (c) a Directed Reading Activity (DRA) group, an instructed control, in which students engaged in a noninteractive, guided reading of stories. The primary quantitative analyses involved two planned orthogonal contrasts—effect of instruction (TA + DRTA vs. 2 x DRA) and intensity of instruction (TA vs. DRTA)—for three whole-sample dependent measures  (a) an error detection test, (b) a comprehension monitoring questionnaire, and (c) a modified cloze test. Results of effect of instruction contrasts revealed that TA and DRTA students were more skillful at comprehension monitoring than DRA students (TA + DRTA>DRA for all three measures). Results of intensity of instruction contrasts indicated that although TA-trained students had greater awareness of comprehension monitoring abilities (TA>DRTA for the questionnaire), DRTA students' performance equaled (TA = DRTA for the cloze test) or exceeded (TA<DRTA for the error detection test) that of the TA students. Qualitative data from student interviews, however, revealed that TA students both reported and demonstrated using a greater depth and breadth of comprehension monitoring abilities than either DRTA or DRA students.

These oral and written language experiences encourage the development of strategies and behaviors that encourage and facilitate the child’s later reading ability. While much attention has been given to the development of vocabulary and phonological awareness knowledge in the young learner, less has been paid to the growth of comprehension skills, particularly in the area of non-fiction, or expository, text. This study investigates the impact of comprehension instruction on disadvantaged preschool children’s understanding of expository children’s books. Forty-five children enrolled in year round Head Start services in Central Pennsylvania were split into ten small groups and read ten non-fiction books over a six week period. Approximately half of the children were taught to summarize content and identify topic during shared book reading sessions, while the remaining children were read the books without explicit instruction.

Data used in the study were compiled from the 27 individual studies comprising the Cooperative Research Program in First-Grade Reading Instruction relevant to three basic questions  1] To what extent are various pupil, teacher, class, school, and community characteristics related to pupil achievement in first-grade reading and spelling? 2] Which of the many approaches to initial reading instruction produces superior reading and spelling achievement at the end of the first grade? 3] Is any program uniquely effective or ineffective for pupils with high or low readiness for reading? The instructional approaches evaluated included Basal, Basal plus Phonics, i.t.a., Linguistic, Language Experience, and Phonic/Linguistic. Identical information was gathered in each project concerning teacher, school, and community characteristics and common experimental guidelines were followed in all 27 studies. Results of the correlation analysis revealed that the ability to recognize letters of the alphabet prior to the beginning of reading instruction was the single best predictor of first-grade reading achievement. The analysis of methodology indicated that the various non-basal instructional programs tended to be superior to basal programs as measured by word recognition skills of pupils after one year of reading instruction. Differences between basal and non-basal programs were less consistent when measures of comprehension, spelling, rate of accuracy of reading, and word study skills constituted the criterion of reading achievement.

Program implementation should be based on valid research pertaining to the efficacy of the approach being used. Concern for the learner's nature and needs should be an essential criterion to be applied in selecting particular instructional materials and procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two methods of introducing reading skills to kindergarteners. A total of 87 subjects participated in the investigation. One group of 42 subjects was designated as the control group, and one group of 45 subjects was designated as the experimental group.

Statistical analysis using the t-test for independent means yielded no significant difference between the groups. The control and experimental groups received reading readiness instruction via two different approaches. The control group received reading instruction via a basal reader readiness program (Houghton Mifflin), and the experimental group received reading instruction via an eclectic, integrated, approach (Success). The instructional period lasted for a period of 140 days. The performance of the two groups on the California Achievement Test, Form E, was analyzed using a t-test for independent means and an a priori alpha risk of.05 to test the six null hypotheses.

38111475,Bortnem (2005),2005,"Young children acquire new vocabulary at an amazing rate during the first five years of life. Because there is a strong relationship between language development during the early years and reading ability in the primary grades, early childhood teachers must understand language and literacy development. Children enter kindergarten in the United States with large differences in their background knowledge, vocabulary, and early literacy experiences. It is essential that early childhood programs provide quality language experiences such as read-alouds in order for children to become successful readers. This study examined the strategy of using nonfiction interactive book read-alouds with the emergent reader in preschool to promote vocabulary development. In this quantitative study, 53 three-, four-, and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program were participants. The preschool children were assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT) as pre and posttests. The researcher read nonfiction literature to one class and fictional text to another twice per week for 12 weeks but did not read to the control group. Standardized test scores did not show significant differences in the post-test scores among the control and the two treatment groups, although all groups showed improvement in their receptive and expressive vocabularies. In addition, a survey designed by the researcher was sent out to preschool teachers and childcare providers about the amount of time they read aloud to children, the amount of time they spend reading fiction compared to nonfiction text, and their years of teaching in early childhood and educational backgrounds. Results showed that teachers in early childhood programs are reading to children an average of 8.5 out of 10 days, although nonfiction literature is not being read to young children as much as fiction. The findings in this report have implications for practice in the field. Because vocabulary development is a key ingredient in the learning-to-read process, teachers and parents can use nonfiction as a tool, if they are aware of the benefits of how to use this genre to support children's emerging literacy skills.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4', '5']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,2,"['Page 22:\n[¬s]""four classrooms[¬e]""', 'Page 45:\n[¬s]""The control group included 23 preschoolers from two classrooms that did not take part in read-alouds with the researcher.[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 45:\n[¬s]""The control group included 23 preschoolers from two classrooms that did not take part in read-alouds with the researcher.[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 22:\n[¬s]""four classrooms[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 52:\n[¬s]""fiction treatment group""\n""nonfiction treatment group""\n""control group[¬e]""']",NA,,"Non-random, but matched",NA,NA,,School - multi-site,NA,NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 45:\n[¬s]""A convenience sample o f 59 three-, fo u r- , and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program in a small Midwestern community o f approximately 25,000 took part in the study.

For eight weeks, Ss were divided in three groups (N = 24 each) & received (1) shared reading, (2) normal instruction, or (3) movement activities. The Ss were pre- & postassessed with two instruments & the scores were compared across groups. It was found that shared reading experiences can make a difference even after eight weeks. Further study on the effect of shared reading on writing performance is encouraged. 1 Table, 2 References. Thesis  This study was an investigation of 4-year old Head Start children's concepts about print and story structure as measured by the Concepts About Print Test (Stones) and the Early School Inventory - Preliteracy. The problem was to determine whether a specific teaching strategy within one curriculum area in Head Start programs could enhance children's knowledge about print and story structure. Specifically, the purpose was to determine if there were differences in responses of Head Start children to concepts about print and to story structure following participation in shared reading experiences with predictable books. The subjects were 72, 4-year old children, divided into three even groups  experimental, placebo, and control. The experimental group participated in shared reading experiences, the placebo group engaged in movement activities  and the control group continued with usual instruction. Each subject was given the Stones, a 24-item test designed to measure concepts about print  and the Early School Inventory - Preliteracy, Part A, a 30-item subtest also designed to measure concepts about print  and Part C, an 8- item subtest, designed to measure a child's knowledge of story structure.

The eighteen students were bilingual Alaska Natives from a rural village in southwest Alaska. Reading ability, as measured on a standardized achievement test, was generally low. One student read at grade level, and the others were two or more grades below grade level. The study used an experimental control group design with measurement of student achievement during baseline, instruction, maintenance, and three-month follow-up. Students' reading performance was measured on daily comprehension tests, Gates-MacGinitie reading tests, and generalization probes in both science and social studies. The experiment resulted in three major findings. First, comparisons between the patterns of growth for the two instructional groups revealed no significant differences on any measure. Second, comparisons between the growth pattern of the combined instructional groups and that of the control group showed significant differences on all measures. The average growth for the instructional groups was 29% on the daily comprehension tests and more than a year on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Comprehension Test.

38111334,Brimmer (2004),2004,"The purpose of this study is to investigate how instruction in thinking aloud procedures helps promote reading comprehension of expository texts with intermediate grade level students. The study is an exploration of how intermediate grade students employed thinking aloud procedures to monitor their comprehension and used fix-up strategies to help them when they experienced difficulty understanding expository texts. The study is based on the following research question  What are the effects of direct instruction in thinking aloud procedures on intermediate grade students' comprehension of expository texts? This study is quantitative research with a quasi-experimental design involving two treatment groups. Throughout the study, both the intervention group and instructed control group read the same expository text materials. The intervention group used thinking aloud procedures while the instructed control group identified various types of expository text structures when reading. The dependent variable is the comprehension of expository texts. The independent variable is the instruction in thinking aloud procedures or expository text structures. In addition to the two conditions, the study has three measures  a pretest, a posttest, and a one-month posttest. The study also includes data from structured interviews of students that queried their awareness of good reading behaviors. The researcher tape-recorded interviews of ten students in each group and transcribed the individual responses. The results of the pretest and posttest of the Degrees of Reading Power (2000a) indicate that there was no significant difference between the think-aloud group and the text structures group in their comprehension of expository texts. The findings from the pretest and posttest using a modified Metacomprehension Strategy Index (Schmitt, 1990) indicated that there was no significant difference between the think-aloud group and the text structures group in their awareness of metacognitive behaviors. The participants in the interview format indicated that students in the think-aloud group had a greater awareness of comprehension-monitoring strategies than did the students in the text structures group.

This is a worthwhile area of current research because LEA is a precursor to Whole Language. In the province of British Columbia, Whole Language is quickly becoming a very popular reading program. Whole Language incorporates a great deal of LEA in theory and in practice. Yet, while many researchers and educators have praised LEA and Whole Language in general, with particular value for L2 students, little empirical research on LEA exists. This study attempts to provide some of this necessary empirical research. An experiment was designed with an independent variable and several dependent variables. The independent variable consisted of one treatment using LEA and another treatment not using LEA. The dependent variables measured growth in reading and writing ability, growth in reading interest, and growth in ESL acquisition. Three Grade One classrooms were involved. Two used a popular, basal reader program and the other used LEA. Fifty percent or more of the students in the three classes were L2 students. Five research hypotheses were formulated. They were  (a) reading ability In the experimental group (LEA) would be greater than in the control group (basal readers), (b) creative writing ability in the experimental group would be greater than' in the control group, (c) reading interest in the experimental group would be greater than in the control group, (d) Second Language acquisition would be greater with the L2 students in the experimental group than with those in the control group and, (e) L2 students in the experimental group would perforin better in reading and writing ability and would have a greater increase in reading than their L2 peers in the control group. The experiment ran for seven months. During the course of the experiment, a formal checklist was used, in periodic visits to the classrooms, to ensure the experimental group was using LEA and the control group was not. Pretests were given in readiness, ESL ability, skill in independent writing, and in attitude towards reading. Posttests were given in vocabulary growth, reading comprehension, ESL ability, skill in independent writing, and attitude towards reading. The research hypotheses were designed in the experiment as five null hypotheses. Rejection of these null hypotheses occurred if p < .05. ANCOVA were used as tests of significance. Of the five null hypotheses, only the one for reading ability was rejected. There were significant differences in reading ability between the LEA and basal reader groups. The scores on the reading posttests favored the subjects using the basal readers. There were no significant differences in writing ability, reading interest, and L2 acquisition between the two groups and between the L2 subjects in the two groups. The results indicate more empirical research i s urgently required. Before Whole Language, similar in philosophy and technique to LEA, i s hastily adopted in British Columbia as the next, major Language Arts program, more empirical research i s needed to determine whether or not Whole Language is in fact, a superior program.

Subjects were 80 students in a public school district's full-time self-contained program for academically gifted. A triangulation research strategy was utilized in which both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered and analyzed. In this posttest only control group design, subjects were randomly assigned to experimental (philosophy) and control (literature) groups at their schools for one hour per day of reading, discussion, and writing. The New Jersey Test of Reasoning Skills and the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Processes, two tests of critical thinking, comprised the quantitative data. Qualitative data included (1) audio recordings of group discussions  (2) student journal entries written during 10 minutes following each discussion session. Transcriptions of a sample of discussion sessions in the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh weeks were coded, and frequency counts were made of student responses in each category on the Critical Thinking in Class Discussions  Student Response Checklist. In the content analysis of student journals, patterns and themes emerged as similar ideas were clustered into categories. Philosophy subjects' scores were significantly higher $(p.<.05)$ than literature subjects' scores on the New Jersey Test but not on the Ross Test. The lack of significance on the Ross Test was considered in terms of a possible ceiling effect. Transcriptions of audio tapes of group discussions revealed a higher percentage of critical thinking responses in philosophy groups for the sampled sessions, with philosophy groups averaging over twice as many critical thinking responses as the literature groups. The percentage of student-to-student responses more than doubled from Week 2 (20%) to Week 11 (54%) for philosophy groups, while the percentage in literature groups remained below 15% for each sampled session. Percentage of teacher talk in philosophy groups was half that in literature groups by the end of the study.

Participants included 122 kindergarteners from three elementary schools within three separate school districts in the northeastern United States who were assigned to either a treatment condition (ELLS, n = 31 EOLs, n = 49) or no-treatment condition (ELLs, n = 17 EOLs, n = 25). Interventionists were trained to deliver direct vocabulary instruction using one of 18 storybooks twice per week in 20-25 minute sessions. The research design of the study employed a pretest, posttest, quasi- experimental group design. Analyses consisted of two-by-two analyses of variance (2 x 2 ANOVAs), with two between-subjects factors (instructional condition x language status), and t-tests to examine the effects of vocabulary intervention on the word learning of ELLs and EOLs, and hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) to investigate word learning differences between ELLs and EOLs using pretest PPVT-III to predict posttest target-word and general, receptive vocabulary knowledge. Participants' knowledge of vocabulary was individually assessed with a researcher-developed measure of target-word knowledge (TWKM) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III (PPVT-III Dunn & Dunn, 1997). Results for 2 x 2 ANOVAs and t-tests indicated that EOLs significantly outperformed ELLs on dependent measures with evidence on an interaction effect on TWKM. HMR results indicated (a) centered pretest PPVT-III accounted for a statistically significant proportion of the variance in posttest measures for participants in the treatment condition and (b) language status did not explain any additional variance in posttest measures above pretest PPVT-III. Each of the two mediation models using the independent variable, language status mediating variable, centered pretest PPVT-III and dependent measures TWKM and PPVT-III resulted in full mediation. Major findings indicated that treatment ELLs and treatment EOLs did equally well on posttest if they had similar initial general, receptive vocabulary knowledge on PPVT-III.

However, despite evidence suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach, little is known about how teachers most effectively model these processes and how students are influenced by modeled strategies. A Social Cognitive Theory of Learning was used as a theoretical basis for this investigation which was designed to address two major questions  (1) What are the relative merits of characteristics of general modeling when applied to cognitive modeling of reading comprehension processes? (2) How do the characteristics of modeling, when applied to cognitive modeling of reading processes, influence the comprehension and comprehension monitoring of eighth grade readers? One hundred average eighth grade readers were randomly assigned to one of four modeling conditions  (1) Passive Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling only. (2) Active Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling with statements to explain the functional value of the modeled strategy and to foster self-efficacy in the students. (3) Full range Cognitive Modeling. Modeling same as ""active"" group with feedback, (4) Control. No modeling. Students met with the researcher in small groups for three sessions. Each session consisted of the researcher's verbal cognitive modeling of a passage being read, followed by the students individually applying the modeled strategy to another passage, followed by an oral retelling of the passage and comprehension questions. Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance for oral retelling scores and for comprehension question scores, and with a chi-square for strategy use. Strategies were predetermined or emerged from qualitative analysis of the think-aloud protocols. Results revealed  (1) There were significant differences among groups for use of reading comprehension monitoring strategies (p $<$.05). The modeling conditions did significantly more monitoring of their comprehension by applying the modeled strategies and by using their own un-modeled strategies. (2) There were significant differences among groups for reading comprehension based on oral retellings (p $<$.05).

One side effect of young children's lack of familiarity with literacy language is that parents do not read to children from books. The present study investigated whether listening to stories in literary Arabic would have salutary effects on kindergarten children's emergent literacy skills. The 258 children in the experimental treatment listened to teachers' story reading daily for 5 months. Teachers in the control classes (49 children) pursued a Ministry of Education program to enhance expressive language skills.

38111492,Freeman (2008),2008,"Raising reading achievement level remains a national priority for all children in the United States. Recent federal government mandates, such as Early Reading First (2002) and Reading First (Armbruster, Lehr, & Osborn, 2001) have emphasized the importance of preschool and kindergarten in accelerating future achievement. Nearly all recommendations for improving the quality of preschool and kindergarten experience include reading aloud to children. Indeed, included in the joint statement of the International Reading Association and the National Association for the Education of Young Children is the assertion that ""the single most important activity for building understandings and skills essential for reading success appears to be reading aloud to children"" (1998). This study examined the effect of teachers' read-aloud styles on the listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition of kindergarten students. Combining methods based upon research by Martinez and Teale (1993), Wasik, Bond, and Hindman (2006), Coyne et al. (2004), Lonigan and Whitehurst (1998), Reese & Cox, (1999), and Brabham & Lynch-Brown (2002), two read-aloud styles were formulated. The full model included brief story introductions, teacher comments modeling the process of making inferences during reading, ""rich"" explanations of target vocabulary, open-ended questions focusing upon story events, an after reading summary question, and guided reconstruction. The parsimonious model emphasized vocabulary and questioning with each story combined with a retelling but without the introduction, after reading question, and story reconstruction. A third model, consisting of a teacher reading aloud in his or her traditional style with follow-up activities, served as the control for this research. Three kindergarten classrooms in each of four local elementary schools were recruited to implement each of the read-aloud models (N = 37). Quantitative data analyses indicated significantly higher gains in measures of vocabulary and comprehension, as well as longer and more complete story retellings, for students in classrooms whose teachers employed the full model of reading aloud, as opposed to students in the parsimonious model or control classrooms.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['5', '6']",NA,NA,,4,"['Page 89:\n[¬s]""Four elementary schools[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 89:\n[¬s]""Four elementary schools[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 89:\n[¬s]""Four elementary schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,4,"['Page 91:\n[¬s]""Table 2 Years Teaching, Highest Degree, and Intervention Assignment of Teacher Participants""\n""School Teacher No. Years of Teaching Highest Degree Earned Read-Aloud Intervention""\n""A 1 12 MA Full""\n""B 1 20 MA Full""\n""C 1 2 BA Full""\n""D 1 3 MA Full[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 91:\n[¬s]""Table 2 Years Teaching, Highest Degree, and Intervention Assignment of Teacher Participants""\n""School Teacher No. Years of Teaching Highest Degree Earned Read-Aloud Intervention""\n""A 1 12 MA Full""\n""B 1 20 MA Full""\n""C 1 2 BA Full""\n""D 1 3 MA Full[¬e]""']",,8,"['Page 91:\n[¬s]""Table 2 Years Teaching, Highest Degree, and Intervention Assignment of Teacher Participants School Teacher No. Years of Teaching Highest Degree Earned Read-Aloud Intervention A 1 12 MA Full""\n""A 3 5 MA Control B 1 20 MA Full""\n""B 3 30 MA Control C 1 2 BA Full""\n""C 3 17 MA Control D 1 3 MA Full""\n""D 3 2 BA Control[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""The full model included brief story introductions, teacher comments modeling the process of making inferences during reading, “rich” explanations of target vocabulary, open-ended questions focusing upon story events, an after reading summary question, and guided reconstruction.

Sixty low socioeconomic level students from the seven first grades of one elementary school in a small South Carolina town were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Both groups were divided into subgroups of six students each, and, for a period of one week, each subgroup received two instructional periods of 30 minutes each and one of 20 minutes. Data revealed no significant differences between the two groups in retention of reading vocabulary. Observations by the experimenter indicated, however, that interest and attention of students was maintained more readily with the language experience approach and that a larger vocabulary was used by language experience students than was apparent in the controlled vocabulary of basal readers.

Four students with reading disabilities in each of two experimental classrooms participated in small-group instruction on the three reading strategies. Researcher-developed strategy tests were used to determine mastery of each strategy. Addtionally, measures of reading achievement on a standardized reading comprehension measure was utilized. Second, effects for all students were measured using a pretest-posttest comparison-group design.

The P4C group showed small positive effect sizes of 0.12 in reading, 0.10 in maths, and 0.07 in cognitive attainment, as compared to the pupils who did not receive the intervention. Teachers and pupils reported that P4C had a positive infuence on wider outcomes such as confidence to speak, listening skills and self-esteem.

Subjects were 32, sixth grade students assigned to discussion groups with or without instruction in question generation  and individuals with or without with instruction in question generation. Students in each three phases of the study read a different literary text, generated questions, and wrote essays. Only the instructional groups received instruction in the generation of inferential questions. The questions generated by all four groups were used for either group discussion or required independent written answers. An assessment was made to determine the effectiveness of question instruction as compared to those who received no instruction  group discussion's influence on the individual compared to individuals responding independently to the questions  and whether an ability to answer higher ordered questions would subsume an ability to answer lower level questions. The findings indicated  (1) Discussion groups evidenced better comprehension than individuals. When all conditions were compared, the groups did better than individuals who did not receive instruction. Organization of group versus individual was significant for comprehension. Instruction in question generation was not. (2) Students who received instruction produced significantly more inferential and fewer literal and total questions. (3) There was no relationship between the number and type of questions generated and comprehension. (4) Students who wrote more inferential questions, discussion groups, and no-discussion individuals who received instruction in question generation produced a greater number of interpretive responses in their essays. (5) Question types ranged taxonomically and students responded to them in kind. Students were able to answer questions on and below their ability level but could not succeed with higher level questions.

Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure  however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies.

38296621,Hanley (2015),2015,"Thinking, Doing, Talking Science (TDTS) is a programme that aims to make science lessons in primary schools more practical, creative and challenging. Teachers are trained in a repertoire of strategies that aim to encourage pupils to use higher order thinking skills. For example, pupils are posed ‘Big Questions’, such as ‘How do you know that the earth is a sphere?’ that are used to stimulate discussion about scientific topics and the principles of scientific enquiry. Two teachers from each participating school received five days of professional development training delivered by a team from Science Oxford and Oxford Brookes University. The training did not aim to provide participating teachers with a set of ‘off-the-shelf’ lesson plans to be delivered in schools  rather, it sought to support teachers to be more creative and thoughtful in planning their science lessons. In addition, teachers had dedicated time to work with colleagues to plan and review lessons taught as part of the project. Teachers were also encouraged to link pupils’ learning in science, with their learning in numeracy and literacy. This project sought to assess the impact of the programme on the academic outcomes and attitudes towards science of Year 5 pupils. 655 pupils from 21 schools across England completed the project. Participating schools followed the programme for the entirety of the 2013/14 academic year. A further 20 schools formed a randomised comparison group and did not receive training in the approach until the following year.","['Oral language interventions', 'Metacognition and self-regulation']",NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10']",NA,NA,,21,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""21 intervention schools[¬e]""']",,21,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""21 control schools[¬e]""']",,42,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" Forty-two primary schools were recruited[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""The evaluators matched schools into pairs based on pre-test results, pupils eligible for free school meals, pupils with English as an additional language, and the size of the school.

38111494,Harvey (2002),2002,"This quasi-experimental study investigated the effect of children's audiotaped storybooks on preschooler's expressive and receptive vocabulary acquisition. Although vocabulary development consistently emerges as a critical literacy skill for young children, many youngsters lag behind in word knowledge because of little exposure to a variety of children's books during their preschool years. Eighty preschool children from suburban preschools, inner-city preschools, and home schools were randomly assigned to a treatment or comparison group where they received either audiobooks or art supplies over 10 weeks. All children involved in the study were given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Forms A and B) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test in order to measure receptive and expressive vocabulary development. A pretest-posttest design was implemented in order to examine the effects on word knowledge when young children listen independently to audiobooks. Data analysis indicated that the children assigned to the experimental group saw a significant increase their receptive and expressive word knowledge. The children who scored the lowest during the initial pretesting experienced the largest gains after treatment was instituted. Although the frequency with which the treatment group listened to the audiobooks was related to the amount of increase in receptive vocabulary, there was no such correlation for expressive vocabulary development. Other demographic variables were also analyzed with varying results. Parents of the treatment group children overwhelmingly reported their children enjoyed listening to the audiobooks. Based on these results, the following two major conclusions can be drawn  (a) independent listening of children's books on audiotape can significantly increase a preschool child's receptive and expressive vocabulary, and (b) the lower the child's initial vocabulary scores, the greater the gain after treatment has been initiated.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4', '5']",NA,NA,,5,"['Page 40:\n[¬s]""Two inner-city schools, two suburban preschools, and the home school support group met the requirements for participation, indicated interest, and were selected for parent information meetings to determine whether parental interest in having their children involved in the study was present.[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 40:\n[¬s]""Two inner-city schools, two suburban preschools, and the home school support group met the requirements for participation, indicated interest, and were selected for parent information meetings to determine whether parental interest in having their children involved in the study was present.[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 40:\n[¬s]""Two inner-city schools, two suburban preschools, and the home school support group met the requirements for participation, indicated interest, and were selected for parent information meetings to determine whether parental interest in having their children involved in the study was present.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 25:\n[¬s]""randomized pretest-posttest control group design (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1993).[¬e]""', 'Page 41:\n[¬s]""Eighty-one students were randomly assigned via a randomization table to either the control or experimental group.[¬e]""', 'Page 44:\n[¬s]""The selection of the treatment and comparison groups was accomplished via stratified random sampling, a technique in which a population is divided into mutually exclusive groups, or strata, such as gender and age, and then a random sample is selected from each group (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 1999; Johnson & Christensen, 2000).

In this study, the following questions were investigated  (I) Would instruction in aural cloze improve the children's vocabulary? (II) Would instruction in aural cloze improve the children's listening comprehension? The subjects for this investigation were 39 boys and 38 girls comprising the kindergarten population of the Hillsdale School in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The kindergarten students were assigned by the two kindergarten teachers to two a.m. and two p.m. sessions. One intact a.m. session taught by one teacher and one intact p.m. session taught by the other teacher were selected as the experimental group. The experimental group consisted of 40 subjects, 20 boys and 20 girls. The other intact a.m. session taught by one teacher and the other p.m. session taught by the other teacher became the control group. The control group consisted of 37 subjects, 19 boys and 18 girls. As part of the on-going kindergarten curriculum, the teachers selected and read storybooks to the children. These storybooks were used in the construction of the aural cloze materials. Meaning-bearing words were systematically deleted from these storybooks. During the aural cloze instruction, the teachers read the specially prepared storybooks and stopped reading and looked at the children to signal that a word had been deleted. The children then supplied words which could complete the passage and still ""make sense."" Each word supplied by the children was discussed and its relationship to the context explored. The children in the experimental group received the aural cloze instruction four days a week for ten weeks. The children in the control group were read the same storybooks which were used in the aural cloze instruction, but no deletions were made and there were no discussions of vocabulary. . . .

Results indicated a significant correlation between error detection, used as a measure of monitoring behavior, and reading comprehension scores. Self-reports of strategy use were not correlated with any other measures. In Study 2, 63 sixth graders participated in one of three groups  control, question-response (QR), or thinking aloud (TA). They completed 15 lessons during which students in the experimental conditions read science passages with embedded errors intended to trigger monitoring and strategy use. Instructors used participant verbalizations to focus instruction on areas of concern using contingent support. Pre- and post-test measures included the Gates-MacGinitie, and all Study 1 measures. Whereas quantitative results indicated that the QR intervention had more positive impact on reading comprehension, thinking aloud did allow instructors to observe the existing strategy use and background knowledge of participants.

38111439,Hoisington (1968),1968,"The study was an experimental investigation designed to ascertain the effectiveness of direct systematic vocabulary instruction emphasizing prefixes, suffixes, and root words. Some elements of sentence structure, mnemonic devices, and etymology were also used to assist vocabulary development. The study involved grade six pupils in the Auburn Public Schools of the State of Washington in a planned sequence of thirty minute lessons over a period of eight weeks. The lessons, including resource and inservice materials for the cooperating teachers, were developed by the experimenter. The Solomon Four Group Design was used in the study. Four intact grade six classes were randomly selected from a population of nineteen intact classes and assigned randomly to treatment positions in the design. The experimental study was handled in three related phases. The first phase included the development of the lesson materials and tlie compilation of pre-experiment data, primarily intelligence test scores, which, could serve as descriptive information about the groups. The second phase of the study involved the administration of pretests to the intact groups indicated as Experimental Group and Control Group 1. The Experimental Group and Control Group 2 were exposed to the experimental treatment, the series of forty lessons, during the ensuing eight weeks. Following the series of lessons, posttests were administered to all groups. The third phase was the analyses of the data as follows  1. The computation of means and standard deviations for scores from the California Test of Mental Maturity  pretest scores and posttest scores from the Metropolitan Achievement Tests  Advanced Battery for the subteats of vocabulary, reading comprehension, and spelling. 2. Three separate two-way analyses of variance were computed using pretested and unpretested scores as ""treatments” coordinated with the experimental variable. 3. Three separate analyses of covariance were computed using the intelligence test scores and the respective pretest scores as covariates. Subsequently, three null hypotheses were tested using the adjusted data from the analyses of covariance. The first null hypothesis was  There will be no significant difference in general vocabulary achievement between control groups and experimental groups on a test of general vocabulary as measured by the subtest on vocabulary of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests  Advanced Battery. The second null hypothesis was  There will be no significant difference in reading comprehension achievement between control groups and experimental groups on a test of general reading comprehension as measured by the sub test on comprehension of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests  Advanced Battery. The third null hypothesis was  There will be no significant difference in spelling achievement between control groups and experimental groups on a test of general spelling achievement as measured by the spelling subtest of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests  Advanced Battery. The level of significance for accepting or rejecting the null hypotheses was established at the .05 level. The obtained levels of probability for adjusted scores were  vocabulary, .09  reading comprehension, .02  and spelling, .08. Therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted for vocabulary and spelling achievement. The null hypothesis was rejected for reading comprehension. The groups exposed to the experimental lessons obtained significantly higher mean scores. The findings of this study suggested that intensive directed vocabulary instruction emphasizing the morphological structure of words can have beneficial results in reading comprehension.

Students (N = 137) from two middle schools in the Piedmont section of North Carolina participated in the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to a seminar group, a typical didactic instruction group, or an observation group. The seminars and lessons focused on concepts in The Declaration of Independence. Results were mixed in that outcomes differed between the two schools. In one of the schools the quality of associations in the seminar group was significantly higher than in the other two groups, but in the other school, though the seminar group scored higher, the difference was not significant. Results on quantity of associations were also mixed (i.e., differed between schools). Speculation on these outcomes centered around the particular characteristics of the different treatments. Relative time spent in teacher-talk versus student-talk, type of teacher question and response, and amount of experience in seminar-like discussions were among the variables considered and thought to be influential in determining outcomes.

The students' attitudes toward the prereading strategies to which they were exposed were also examined. There were two experimental treatment groups and one comparison no-treatment group. The treatment conditions were semantic mapping and a conventional basal approach. Semantic mapping, a categorical structuring of information in graphic form, emphasized the relationship of target words to learners' prior knowledge. Sixty-seven, fifth grade, black, inner city students from a large midwestern public school district participated in a practice session and two experimental sessions of approximately forty-five minutes each. Each session consisted of subjects participating in a prereading activity, reading an expository passage and completing a multiple choice vocabulary test and a passage-specific reading comprehension test. Following the last experimental session, subjects completed an attitude questionnaire. Mean scores of intact classrooms were used as the unit of data analysis. Data were analyzed using the Welch Aspin and the Wilcoxon Tests. The three major hypotheses compared the performance of the subjects on the dependent measures of vocabulary acquisition, passage-specific reading comprehension and affective responses of subjects to the two experimental strategies. The results indicated that the semantic mapping group scored significantly higher on the vocabulary acquisition and the passage-specific reading comprehension tests. No statistically significant differences in attitudes toward the treatments were found between the two groups. An examination of the descriptive data indicated that both experimental groups had positive attitudes toward the vocabulary teaching strategies.

38111649,Justice (2005),2005,"Purpose  The extant literature suggests that exposure to novel vocabulary words through repeated readings of storybooks influences children’s word learning, and that adult elaboration of words in context can accelerate vocabulary growth. This study examined the influence of small-group storybook reading sessions on the acquisition of vocabulary words for at-risk kindergartners, and the impact of word elaboration on learning. An additional goal was to study differential responses to treatment for children with high versus low vocabulary skill. Method  Using a pretest–posttest comparison group research design, 57 kindergartners were randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 29) or comparison (n = 28) group. Children were also differentiated into high (n = 31) versus low (n = 26) vocabulary skill groups using scores on a standardized receptive vocabulary test. Children in the treatment group completed 20 small-group storybook reading sessions during which they were exposed to 60 novel words randomly assigned to non-elaborated and elaborated conditions. Pre and posttest examined the quality of children’s definitions for the 60 novel words. Results  Overall, word-learning gains were modest. Children in the treatment group made significantly greater gains in elaborated words relative to children in the comparison group  no influence of storybook reading exposure was seen for non-elaborated words. Children with low vocabulary scores made the greatest gains on elaborated words.

It also examined 8 specific child- and setting-level moderatorsto determine whether these influenced the relation between teachers' use of a print-referencing style and children's print-knowledge development. Method  In this randomized controlled trial, 59 teachers were randomly assigned to 2 conditions. Teachers in the experimental group (n = 31) integrated explicit references to specified print targets within each of 120 read-aloud sessions conducted in their classrooms over a 30-week period  comparison teachers (n = 28) read the same set of book titles along the same schedule but read using their business-as-usual reading style. Children's gains over the 30-week period on a composite measure of print knowledge were compared for a subset of children who were randomly selected from the experimental (n = 201) and comparison (n = 178) classrooms. Results  When controlling for fall print knowledge, child age, and classroom quality, children who experienced a print-referencing style of reading had significantly higher print knowledge scores in the spring than did children in the comparison classroom. None of the child-level (age, initial literacy skills, language ability) or setting-level characteristics (program type, instructional quality, average level of classroom socioeconomic status, teachers' education level, teachers' experience) significantly moderated intervention effects.

Measures included multiple-choice tests and retell scores. In both experiments, it was found that substituting easy vocabulary words for difficult vocabulary words in a contrived passage made the text significantly easier to comprehend, and that redundant information in a text significantly contributed to successful text comprehension except for the retell scores in the first experiment. Instruction on difficult vocabulary facilitated comprehension in both experiments. Differences between instructional procedures were significant for the multiple-choice test scores in Experiment 1 and for the retell scores in Experiment 2.

An index of development in reading interest was taken and pupil attitude toward reading determined. Teachers for the Experience Approach and the Traditional Method groups were randomly selected from method representative-teachers in the first grades of San Diego County schools. The research population obtained consisted of 27 teachers in each group and an approximate student population of 750 in each treatment group. Instructional procedures were controlled through in-service training sessions both before and during the course of the investigation. Pupil scores on appropriate pre-test and post-test instruments were used as criteria for determining the relative effectiveness of the two approaches. Analysis of results revealed that, in the comparisons made, ten favored the Traditional Method group while five favored the Experience Approach group. The level of significance required for these comparisons was .01. No significant differences between the Experience Approach and the Traditional Method groups were found, although significant differences were observed for fifteen of the comparisons.

Teachers are trained to develop and teach challenging, enquiry-based science lessons that incorporate more practical activities, deeper thinking and discussion, and sharply focused recording. Following promising results from an efficacy trial of TDTS (Hanley et al., 2015), this effectiveness trial was commissioned to test its impact when implemented at scale. In this trial, science teachers received the training on four days spread across the school year, and the impact on the pupils in their science classes was measured at the end of the year. The model of TDTS tested here differs from the previous model in three key ways  the number of teacher training days was reduced from five to four  funding for two additional days of preparation per teacher (in the form of cover costs) was cut  and the programme also used a ‘train the trainer’ model in which CPD was led by pairs of experts who were trained in the TDTS model by the programme authors, rather than the authors training teachers directly (trainers were delivering the training to schools for the first time during the trial). The study used a two-arm cluster randomised controlled design  205 schools were randomised to either receive TDTS or to be part of a ‘business as usual’ waitlist control group  233 Year 5 teachers at 102 intervention schools received the training. The evaluation focused on the impact of TDTS on the educational attainment of pupils, as measured through a standardised science assessment. The study also used a survey to measure pupil interest in, and self-efficacy toward, science.

An adaptation of the Primary Pupil Reading Attitude Inventory was administered in March 1970, in order to assess attitude differences. In May 1970, the California Reading Test was administered. The results of all statistical analyses suggest that there were no significant differences in attitude toward reading between the two groups.

Thirty-six children, ages three to five, attending a day care center serving a minority, racial group in a low-economic area were randomly placed into three treatment groups and one control group. All of the subjects were administered three pre-tests and three post-tests. For ten weeks the researcher met with the three treatment groups on a daily basis. Groups One and Two heard the same stories, the difference between the groups being the amount of language interaction initiated by the researcher. Group Three worked freely with art materials. The effect of the reading aloud, language interaction and the interaction of the two were each addressed by the three post-tests. Analysis of covariance was used to measure differences, the covariates being the three pre-tests and ages of the subjects. There were no statistically significant results from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or Development of Oral Language test. The results from the Concepts About Print test did show a statistically significant effect from reading aloud. Results from the Concepts About Print test did not show statistically significant effects for language interaction or the combination of reading aloud and language interaction, however. Subsequent analysis of the means and standard deviations for each of the four groups, on each of the post-tests, plus a look at the gains and losses made by the subjects from the pre-tests to the post-tests did provide some interesting insight into possible reasons for the lack of significance in this study.

38111380,Li (1996),1996,"The case method has been widely used in preparation programs in training business people, lawyers, and doctors, but it has rarely been used with younger students. This study was designed to examine (1) whether fifth grade students were mature enough to handle the case method, and (2) whether the case method was effective in improving fifth grade students' reading comprehension. My hypothesis was that fifth grade students were not only able to handle the case method, but also that the case method would be as effective in improving students' academic work as it had been with adults. 62 fifth grade students from three classes were assigned to one of three treatment groups--the case method group, the strategy group, or the control group (which was controlled for the instructional method used). The study lasted eight weeks with the first and the last week allocated to testing. Three hours of instruction occurred each week. Students were monitored for their reading comprehension by six weekly comprehension quizzes and pre- and post-study comprehension tests. Students were also monitored for their reading strategy awareness, their attitudes toward reading, and their attribution of success or failure in reading. Findings from this study demonstrate that (1) students as young as fifth graders could learn to use the case method, and (2) the case method was more effective than the strategy method in improving students' reading comprehension. The students in the case method group exhibited stronger performance on the six comprehension quizzes and suffered the least loss among the three groups when external conditions were disruptive. The findings also support the knowledge that reading strategies can be taught to students using direct and explicit instructional methods.

The second program was patterned after the Palincsar and Brown (1984) reciprocal teaching techniques and focused on training four text comprehension strategies used by skilled comprehenders. Both the “knowledge-base” and the “strategy” training approaches were associated with significant improvement in disabled readers' comprehension skills, although training effects did not generalize across all aspects of reading comprehension performance. Strategy-trained readers applied the trained strategies with equal success on instructed and uninstructed text materials, providing strong evidence of transfer of learning.

However, community use of printed materials varies, resulting in a large number of nonmainstream children deemed at risk for school failure at an early age. In an effort to address this situation, a study examined the effects of including shared book reading activities in an urban preschool program that identified at-risk children through assessment of child and family characteristics. A year-long intervention supplemented the regular program with weekly classroom reading and sharing of simple books  use of book topics for writing and dramatic play  and shared book reading by parents and children at home. The study employed a quasi-experimental control design with multiple converging measures of children's knowledge of language and literacy constructs and parent questionnaire responses. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed that literacy development can be fostered through the incorporation of shared book reading. Pre- and posttest comparisons also revealed that at-risk children can make substantial growth in language development, print concept awareness, letter knowledge, writing, and reading abilities.

A total of 53 inner-city, low socioeconomic status (SES) subjects participated in the 20-week study. Subjects were dichotomized at the median on a measure of development level into average- and delayed-development level groups and were then randomly assigned from each of the two development strata to two experimental groups and to one control group. The subjects in Experimental Group 1 were exposed to adult-interactive behaviors during repeated readings of ""big book"" story-books. Subjects in Experimental Group 2 were exposed to repeated ""big book"" storybook readings without adult interaction. Control group subjects participated in the regular prekindergarten curricular activities. Two separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed on the subjects' scores on the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) and on the Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA). The analysis of the PLS data indicated a significant main effect of treatment (p $<$.0001). Subjects in both experimental groups scored significantly higher than control group subjects, but there was no difference between the two experimental groups. The one-way ANCOVA test for main effects of treatment on the TERA was not statistically significant. Subjects' scores on the PLS and TERA were also subjected to two separate, two-way (development level by treatment) analyses of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVAs confirmed the significant treatment effect on the PLS and nonsignificant treatment effect on the TERA and indicated significant development level effects on both instruments in the expected direction (i.e., average-development level subjects scored significantly higher than delayed-development level subjects). There were no significant interaction effects between development levels and treatments. The results suggested that the language development of low SES prekindergarten students identified as being at risk of academic failure could be enhanced through repeated storybook readings, whether or not the adult who was reading aloud initiated interactive behaviors.

Traditional and structural treatment groups each significantly improved performance on traditional and structural questions, respectively. Each treatment also had a small positive effect on children's ability to answer the other type of question. The combined treatment group made the greatest gains.

The central question addressed in this paper is how best to teach new vocabulary items to these children. Aims To investigate the effects of two different methods of teaching vocabulary on both vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension. Methods & Procedures Twenty four children aged 7 8 years with poor existing vocabulary knowledge took part in an intervention study. Half the children were taught new vocabulary items using definitions the other half were taught a strategy for deriving meanings from written context. Tests of vocabulary knowledge were given before teaching, immediately after teaching and 3 months later. Outcomes & Results Immediately after teaching, both groups had improved equivalently in vocabulary knowledge for the taught words. However, 3 months later, the context group showed significantly better expressive vocabulary knowledge. The context group went on to show significantly better comprehension of text containing a number of the taught words and demonstrated that they could use the newly acquired strategy independently to derive meanings from written context. Conclusions The context method developed is effective in increasing vocabulary knowledge and improving reading comprehension in children with poor existing vocabulary knowledge, and this is therefore recommended for use with children who require extra help developing vocabulary and comprehension skills.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8']",NA,Year 3,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,1,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""The entire Year 3 of a large state school was screened during the spring term and a\nsubsample with the poorest language skills was selected to take part in the\nintervention.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""The entire Year 3 of a large state school was screened during the spring term and a\nsubsample with the poorest language skills was selected to take part in the\nintervention.

Thirty-nine students from two fifth grade classes participated in the study. Twenty students in the experimental group received district curriculum reading instruction using metacognitive strategy instruction they were taught the purpose and value of using four metacognitive strategies  (1) think-aloud, (2) text connections, (3) visualization, and (4) questioning. Nineteen students in the control group received district curriculum reading instruction without metacognitive strategy instruction. These two fifth grade classes did not have significant differences on pre-test measures of formal or informal reading assessments. After a 15-week treatment period, posttest scores were indicative of significant differences between the experimental and control group that could be ascribed to metacognitive strategy instruction. Ten students from each group were interviewed assessing this metacognitive strategy use and reading ability. These students were also observed during the course of the study to determine whether the study's metacognitive strategies mentioned were actually used during non-instructional times. Students' interview responses before strategy instruction indicated that both groups used reading behaviors about reading as reading strategies. After metacognitive strategy instruction, only students in the experimental group stated text connections, visualization, and questioning as strategies used to aid comprehension of expository text. This further suggested that the experimental group was significantly affected by metacognitive strategy instruction. Findings for this research study suggested that after metacognitive strategy instruction non-proficient students' reading comprehension improved significantly on The Test of Reading Comprehension (TORC-3).

Third and 5th grade students received either contextuallybased multiple meaning vocabulary instruction embedded in the standard language arts instruction offered to all students over a three-month period or the standard language arts instruction alone (i.e., non-specific treatment). Students who received the contextually-based multiple meaning instruction generally showed statistically and educationally significant gains in their vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension relative to students who did not. These gains were most evident in reading comprehension.

Components of traditional instruction included  know-wonder-learn, question-answer relationship, retelling, story frames, and story maps. In addition to these, the three components in the multi-strategy approach in this study were reciprocal teaching, think-pair-share, and question/response cueing. The impact that the three component instructional approach had on reading comprehension was evaluated in a quasi-experimental study in which the reading performances of the 92 students in the treatment group were contrasted with the performances of the 93 students in the control group receiving traditional instruction. Students were heterogeneously grouped. To test the impact of multi-strategy instruction on reading comprehension, a two-way repeated ANOVA was computed using CTBS Fall to Spring and the treatment/control as the two independent variables. The dependent standardized measure incorporated to measure reading comprehension was the California Test of Basic Skills. The means and standard deviations for the total scores of the treatment and control groups were presented and found to be insignificant. It was concluded that the data analysis for the standardized scores for this study of reading comprehension did not favor the treatment or control group. Mean post-test minus pre-test differences for scores for the performance assessment measure were computed. Though numerical differences in favor of the treatment group on a Maryland State Performance Assessment prototype were noted, the weak validity of state performance assessments and small sample size of this study did not permit conclusions. Research implications include the development of refined instruments for measuring the impact of strategy application on reading comprehension and including direct instruction to develop students' understanding of conditional knowledge.","['Oral language interventions', 'Collaborative learning']",NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '11']",NA,NA,,≤5,"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""five\nelementary schools[¬e]""']",,≤5,"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""five\nelementary schools[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""five elementary schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,4,"['Page 22:\n[¬s]""four classrooms of fifth grade students having reading comprehension instruction[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 22:\n[¬s]"" four fifth grade classrooms ""\n""did not receive the multi-strategy approach instruction[¬e]""']",,8,"['Page 22:\n[¬s]""four classrooms of fifth grade students having reading comprehension instruction""\n"" Group A""\n"" four fifth grade classrooms ""\n""Group B classrooms did not receive the multi-strategy approach instruction[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],NA,"There are two experimental groups and one control group.

Students from 3 classrooms participated in collaborative reasoning discussions for a period of 5 weeks. Then, these students and students from 3 comparable classrooms who had not engaged in collaborative reasoning wrote persuasive essays.

Consistent with the sociocognitive perspective on learning and the schema-theoretic view of argumentation development, oral discussions and explicit instruction are expected to help students acquire a sense of the overall structure of an argument, or an argument schema. Students with a developed argument schema should be able to perform better on various tasks related to argumentation. In a quasi-experiment presented in this study, students completed the same argument-related tasks, after receiving different instructional treatments. These tasks included an interview, designed to elicit students' awareness of argumentation criteria, a persuasive composition, and a recall of an argumentative text. The findings reveal the complexity of learning and transfer in the domain of argumentation. Students who engaged in discussions with or without explicit instruction provided well-articulated responses to the interview questions, showing a rather sophisticated understanding of argumentation functions and criteria. Overall student performance on the persuasive essay was positively affected only by participation in discussions. The recall of an argumentative text was insensitive to variations in treatment.

38111672,Simon (2003),2003,"The development of language and literacy skills is vital to future success in our society. Early intervention in critical areas of preschool language (vocabulary, comprehension, and narrative ability) and early literacy skills can facilitate this development. Typical interventions in preschool settings utilize storybooks to target these critical areas. However, research on large group teacher implemented storybook interventions to improve language skills is limited. In this study, Head Start teachers were trained to use a storybook intervention entitled, Storybook Activities for Improving Language (SAIL). The SAIL intervention consisted of four days of teacher led activities built around storybooks incorporating repeated readings, vocabulary activities, and retelling and acting out activities. A main focus was on vocabulary skills with secondary focuses on comprehension, narrative ability, and print awareness. Language and early literacy measures were administered at pre and post test to the SAIL intervention group and a control group. A multivariate analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effectiveness o f SAIL on those measures. A significant effect was found for a vocabulary measure requiring children to name the categories and features o f the target vocabulary words used in the SAIL intervention and for a narrative retell measure requiring children to retell a story within a time limit. There were no significant effects found for vocabulary measures assessing general vocabulary development, comprehension, or print awareness. Based on the results, five conclusions can be drawn  a) the SAIL intervention led to increases in vocabulary skills  b) the SAIL intervention did not lead to increases in comprehension skills  c) the SAIL intervention led to increases in narrative ability  d) SAIL did not lead to increases in print awareness  and e) teachers rated the SAIL intervention favorably upon a program evaluation questionnaire. Despite limitations warranting caution in interpretation, this study added to existing research on storybook interventions in preschool in several ways. First, SAIL showed that a class-wide teacher implemented storybook intervention led to significant gains in vocabulary skills and narrative ability for preschool age children.

38296685,Styles (2014),2014,"Chatterbooks is an extracurricular reading initiative that aims to increase a child’s motivation to read by providing schools with tools and resources to encourage reading for pleasure. The intervention developed for this trial consisted of nine weekly one hour sessions where the pupils read and discussed an age-appropriate book. The programme was delivered by trained graduates to Year 7 pupils who had not reached a secure Level 4 in English at the end of Key Stage 2. Chatterbooks was developed by the Reading Agency as an extracurricular activity, organised in local libraries on Saturday mornings by volunteers. The sessions are intended for six to twelve-year-olds and attendance is voluntary. For the purposes of this evaluation, the Chatterbooks programme was altered significantly to test its impact in a more structured and formalised school environment. A variation called Chatterbooks Plus was delivered alongside the Chatterbooks programme. In this intervention, fifteen minutes of a sixty minute session were replaced with dialogic reading where children read aloud and were offered explicit prompts. The target population for this evaluation was pupils in secondary schools in an area of the Midlands accessible from Coventry University. The programme was delivered by trained graduates at Coventry University who had received training from the Reading Agency and Professor Clare Wood (for the dialogic reading component). Intervention delivery took place from April to June 2013. Chatterbooks aims to encourage reading for pleasure. It is assumed that this translates into an improvement in reading ability. This evaluation set out to measure what impact the scheme had on reading ability as measured by the GL Assessment New Group Reading Test. The evaluation was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of 23 projects focused on literacy catch-up at the primary-secondary transition. It was one of four programmes funded with a particular focus on reading comprehension. There was no evidence of impact of either Chatterbooks or Chatterbooks Plus on pupils’ reading ability either immediately after the interventions or at a three-month follow-up. The headline findings suggest that Chatterbooks and Chatterbooks Plus had a slightly negative impact on reading ability with effect sizes of -0.14 and -0.01 respectively. However, they are not statistically significant, suggesting that the difference in outcomes between the control and intervention group occurred by chance. Consequently, the effect sizes are indistinguishable from zero. The results for children on free school meals in both interventions should be interpreted in the same way.

The Talk of the Town model is a whole school approach in which four main strands or components of work are embedded  workforce development for all staff to support children’s SLC skills, including an experienced, trained and managed Speech and Language Therapist (SaLT) working in school one day per week training all staff  the early identification of children’s speech, language and communication needs, including developmental delays  universal approaches and targeted SLC interventions to support the development of age appropriate SLC skills  and support for senior leaders to embed speech, language and communication as part of whole school development planning and practice, to ensure a sustainable approach to speech, language and communication support. The primary aim of this study, funded by the Education Endowment Foundation, was to identify whether Talk of the Town had an impact on pupil reading levels. Secondary aims included assessing the impact of the intervention on the language outcomes of children with low prior attainment in literacy, and exploring evidence of potential links between speech, language and communication and children’s reading attainment. The study also involved a process evaluation which involved interviews a survey with participating staff.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '9', '10', '8', '11']",NA,NA,,32,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""Allocated to intervention (school n = 32;[¬e]""']",,32,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""Allocated to control (school n = 32[¬e]""']",,64,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""Randomised (school n = 64[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 17:\n[¬s]""cluster randomised design[¬e]""', 'Page 22:\n[¬s]""Assignment to condition was by block randomisation.

Subjects were 31 fourth-grade average and poor readers from 8 Dutch elementary schools. Four groups of students were assigned to the experimental group and four groups were assigned to the control group. The experimental group received 12 lessons of 45 minutes each, twice a week. The training groups consisted of average and poor reading comprehenders, so that the average readers could be a model for the poor readers. Pre- and post-tests measured students' skills of word meaning derivation and general reading comprehension skills. Results indicated that students who received the training strategies to derive word meanings were able to use the strategies in reading texts, but a transfer effect to more general reading comprehension was not found to occur. Findings suggest that a training program that focuses on word meaning derivation strategies is a helpful tool for the remediation of poor readers' problems with reading a text.

38111552,van Kleeck (2006),2006,"Purpose  Preschoolers with language impairment have difficulties with both literal and inferential language, both of which are critical to later reading comprehension. Because these children are known to be at risk for later reading comprehension difficulties, it is important to design and test interventions that foster both literal and inferential language skills. Using a randomized pretest-posttest control group design, we investigated whether an 8-week, one-on-one book-sharing intervention would improve both the literal and inferential language skills of Head Start preschoolers with language impairments. Method  Thirty children were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no intervention or to a treatment group that received twice-weekly 15-min sessions in which adults read books and asked both literal and inferential questions about the books using scripts that were embedded throughout the text. Treatment and control groups were compared using pre- and posttest scores on 2 measures of literal and 1 measure of inferential language skill. Results  Significant group differences, and medium to large effect sizes, were found between pre- and posttest scores for all 3 measures. Conclusions  These findings suggest that book sharing with embedded questions that target both literal and inferential language skills can result in gains on both types of language in this population.

38111686,Walsh (2009),2009,"This dissertation study employed quantitative methods to investigate the impact of adult questioning styles on children's novel vocabulary acquisition during shared storybook reading. In an effort to examine adult qualitative variations in shared storybook readings, two experiments were conducted to assess the effect of noneliciting questions during shared storybook reading on children's receptive and expressive novel vocabulary learning. The sociocultural perspective was the theoretical framework of this dissertation study and maintains that learning is due to socially meaningful activity of the child within the environment (e.g., Bruner, 1983  Vygotsky, 1978). In the first experiment, 45 children enrolled in monolingual Head Start classrooms were ranked by general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of three conditions  vocabulary noneliciting questions, vocabulary eliciting questions, and no questions (control). In the second experiment, the novel vocabulary learning of 54 children enrolled in a bilingual English-Spanish Head Start program was investigated. In the second experiment, participants were ranked by Spanish general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of four conditions  (1) Spanish vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (2) English vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (3) Spanish labels, and (4) English labels. Experiment 1 utilized the methodological framework employed in previous experimental work on storybook reading  pretest, intervention, and posttest with the addition of a delayed posttest in Experiment 1. Vocabulary noneliciting questions, eliciting questions, and no questions appear to be equally effective. There was no decay of the words learned as determined by delayed post-test. Experiment 2's methodological framework resembles that utilized by Justice (2002) conducted with a monolingual sample. Experiment 2 also utilized other methodological considerations from the existing literature to examine the effects of noneliciting questions on the novel vocabulary learning of bilingual preschoolers. Experiment 2 revealed that English labels are more effective than English noneliciting questions for receptive knowledge. Spanish noneliciting questions lead to greater expressive word learning than Spanish labels. This study has a number of major impacts, including comparison of Experiment 1's results to the extant literature which is instructive  and, while there is a preponderance of literature with monolingual populations, research with bilingual populations is limited, thus Experiment 2 helps to close that gap.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],NA,NA,,Low ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4', '5']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 76:\n[¬s]""Vocabulary Eliciting Question condition, the Noneliciting Question condition, and the No Question (control) condition.

During the first session, small groups of subjects received a vocabulary lesson on one set of five words (central or noncentral), using one of two methods of instruction (dictionary or concept) for one of two stories. Twenty-four hours later the second session was held, and two comprehension measures (recall and questions) and two vocabulary measures (definition and example) were administered. The results of the word-level treatment indicated that preteaching unfamiliar vocabulary enhanced children's comprehension of story ideas that were related to the instructed vocabulary regardless of level of importance. The results of the instructional method treatment were unclear due to interactions with story. The results also suggested that comprehension questions designed to evaluate students' understanding of story ideas that were related to the instructed vocabulary provided a more sensitive measure of children's comprehension than a general recall measure.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" two elementary schools[¬e]""']",NA,,Low ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '11']",NA,NA,,2,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""The subjects for this experiment were 120 fifth-grade students from two elementary schools located within a single school district in a suburban area of Detroit.

The experimental group was exposed once each week to materials from the Philosophy for Children program as a supplement to their regular reading program for eight months of the school year. The reading comprehension achievement of two subsets of the experimentals, those above grade level and those below grade level on the pre-test, was also analyzed. Results with above grade level students support previous studies indicating that including philosophical skills in the reading program leads to greater achievement than would be expected in normal development. Further, the results of the low level students reveal that such skills may also lead to improved reading comprehension achievement. © 1982 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '11']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,3 ,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""The subjects were 100 fifth grade students (45 males and 55 females)\nfrom three schools in Upshur County, West Virginia.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,4,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""The classes\nwere intact classes, one control group and four experimental.[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""The classes\nwere intact classes, one control group and four experimental[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""The classes\nwere intact classes, one control group and four experimental.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, not matched prior to treatment","['Page 4:\n[¬s]""The experimental group was a combined group of 80 students taught by four teachers, all of whom were reading specialists.
