The objective of Lesson 1 was to teach students self-questioning as a first step in comprehension monitoring. The concept of self-questioning was introduced by presenting to the students the fictional figure Clark Canine-Super Reporter (CC/SR). CC/SR was modeled after similar meta- phors Paris and his colleagues developed for their Informed Strategies for Learning metacognitive instructional program (Paris, 1985; Paris et al., 1984). CC/SR, who appeared throughout the 10 TA group lessons, was presented as a special kind of reporter who interviewed writers. The students were taught to view the role of a reporter (one who interviews people) as being analogous to the role of a reader (one who interviews writers). The students were asked to think of themselves as Pup Reporters, novice writer-interviewers led by CC/SR, whose job it was to interview (i.e., ask questions of) writers whose stories they read. CC/SR was displayed as a large cutout (a canine dressed to look like Clark Kent, i.e., Super- man). A chart that compared how reporters and readers are alike was also intro- duced in Lesson 1. The first pair of items on this chart, which were affixed to the chart during the lesson, indicated that reporters and readers are alike in that they both conduct interviews by asking writers/people questions. Additional ways in which readers and reporters are alike were added to the chart as other comprehen- sion monitoring and correction strategies were introduced in subsequent lessons. For example, in Lesson 2, the two following statements were added to the chart: (a) ""Reporters get information from the person they interview and from what they know already"" and (b) ""Readers get information from the writer and from what[¬e]""', 'Page 11:\n[¬s]""they know already."" Instruction and application in how to question a writer oc- curred through the guided reading of the basal story used in Lesson 1. Lesson 2: Sources of information. Using a modified form of Raphael\'s (1982) question-answer relationship strategy, students were taught that information can come from ideas in the story and from ideas a student may already possess (i.e., after Pearson & Johnson\'s, 1978, notion of textually explicit and scriptally implicit information). Lesson 3: TA introduction: Is the story making sense? Students were intro- duced to the notion of thinking aloud as they read by being taught to: (a) read short text sections, (b) stop periodically and say out loud what their thoughts were about the story, (c) ask "" I s this making sense?"", and (d) respond to this question. Lesson 4: TA review and extension. This was a cumulative review of the first three lessons. Lesson 5: Predicting, reading, and verifying. Students were taught to use a predict-read-verify strategy (Baumann, 1991); they expressed their predictions and their evaluations of them through think aloud. Lesson 6: Understanding unstated information. Students were taught to infer unstated information in a story according to a simplified version of the inference categories recommended by Johnson and Johnson (1986); they used think aloud to verbalize what a writer omitted, drawing from story and experience clues. Lesson 7: Retelling a story. Retelling was presented as a think-aloud strategy for helping a reader to understand and remember a story. Lesson 8: Rereading and reading on. Students were instructed to stop periodi- cally while reading and ask themselves, "" I s this story making sense?"" When they responded "" n o "" to this question, they were asked to employ one of two correction strategies to help them clarify meaning, either a rereading strategy or a read-on- and-withhold-judgment strategy.

The words in quotations are from the script that teachers received for the in- struction and illustrate how the information was provided to students. • First, the word was contextualized for its role in the story: “In the story, it said that the animals found the robbers’ ta- ble full of good things to eat, and so they had a feast.” • Next, the meaning of the word was ex- plained: “A feast is a big special meal with lots of delicious food.” • The children were asked to repeat the word so that they could create a pho- nological representation of it: “Say the word with me: feast.” • Examples in contexts other than the one used in the story were provided: “People usually have a feast on a hol- iday or to celebrate something special. We all have a feast on Thanksgiving Day.” • Children made judgments about ex- amples: “Which would be a feast: eat- ing an ice cream cone or eating at a big table full of all kinds of food? Why?” • Children were asked to construct their own examples: “If you wanted to eat a feast, what kinds of food would you want?” • The word’s phonological and mean- ing representations were reinforced: “What’s the word that means a big special meal?”""\n""In addition to introducing words in the manner shown above, teachers were asked to reinforce the words on subsequent days.[¬e]""', 'Page 8:\n[¬s]""For example, all teachers kept charts of the words from several stories posted on the wall.

Vocabulary Building Cluster 2 taught students how to recognize when a word is affixed or has distinct, morphological units. For these words, students were taught to divide unknown words into prefixes, roots, and suffixes. Then students were taught to add the meanings of parts within this word together to derive its meaning. 3. Vocabulary Building Cluster 3 taught students how to identify the meaning of content-specific words. Students learned that many long, unfamiliar words that they have not seen frequently will most often have a meaning that is related to the particular content area and theme of the paragraph in which the unknown content-area word appears. Students are also taught how to connect the meanings of known content-area words to the possible specific object, event, phenomenon, etc. to which the unknown word must refer by relat - ing all meanings from all other content-specific words to the unknown word. The unknown word will contain a meaning that describes a unique aspect of the theme not portrayed by the other content-specific words in that paragraph. 4. Vocabulary Building Cluster 4 taught students to use the unusual letter or sound combination of a word as a signal that the wordÕs meaning has to be memorized, as it likely has an unusual word history or is derived from a foreign language.

I will be showing you some ways to read that will help you better understand what you read. I will read some passages out loud, saying my thoughts out loud as I go along. I will say what is confusing for me while I read and what I can do to fix it up. You will follow on your copy. Pay attention to the types of things I think and say while I\'m reading. 2.

PASSIVE COGNITIVE MODELING GROUP Step 1 Cognitive Modeling: The researcher cognitively- modeled a passage for the subjects. This modeling followed the same think-aloud strategy used in session 1 with the same emphasis on problem identification and fix-up strategies. The think-aloud steps and fix-up strategies remained posted throughout the study. Step 2 Verbal Protocol: Next, following a procedure developed by Meichenbaum and Goodman (1971), each subject individually performed the modeled think-aloud strategy to him/herself while silently reading another passage with no help from the researcher. Following the think-aloud the subject received a list of the think-aloud steps and was asked to self-check this ""signpost"" listing to see if he/she performed the steps in the strategy. Step 3 Comprehension Assessment: Immediately following, the subject was asked to work on a personal interests questionnaire which served as a buffer task. Based on Kintsch\'s (1974) work on memory, the insertion of an ""unrelated buffer passage"" between reading and recalling helps to block short term memory and helps assure that propositional memory and not short term memory is being tested. The use of a questionnaire for this purpose has been used in other studies (Mandel and 96[¬e]""', 'Page 113:\n[¬s]""Johnson, 1984; Pritchard, 1987) and was therefore used in this study. (See Appendix P.) After several minutes, the subject was instructed to orally retell the passage that he/she just read with the instruction Tell me everything you can remember about the passage you just read. What you might want to do is pretend that I haven\'t read it and that you\'re going to tell me everything you can remember about it. After the subject completed the retelling, probes were used""\n"" (e.g. Student: ""Well, it was about manatees and where they lived, and what they eat, and how they eat."" Probe: ""Are there any other things it told about the manatees?"" Student: ""Ya, they eat under water, and they live near Florida in lagoons and stuff like that."" Probe: ""Is there anything else y o u ’d like to add?""

In the first TA lesson, the RAs introduced the purpose of the study while reading The Magic School Bus in the Solar System (Cole, 1992). The RAs pointed out that the characters in the story often thought aloud about what they were seeing and learning. The RAs told the participants that they would be learning to think aloud as they read. The RAs then read the story orally and modeled thinking aloud about[¬e]""', 'Page 39:\n[¬s]""the content of the story. The RAs told the students that if they had difficulty, they would teach them some strategies to help them understand science passages better. The RAs explained that the four strategies help readers to think about what the information in science passages means. After the RAs finished modeling thinking aloud and strategy use, the participants practiced thinking aloud while reading sections of The Magic School Bus in the Solar System (Cole, 1992) with the RAs\' guidance. This initial lesson concluded with students generating a set of questions related to space that they would like to learn in the lessons together. The students wrote these questions and drew pictures of objects found in space on black construction paper using colored pencils. Each subsequent TA lesson included pre-reading activities, silent reading with monitoring, oral reading with thinking aloud, and summarization to conclude the lesson. Prior to silent reading, the RAs read a scripted statement to inform the students that some of the passages contained mistakes made by the author, such as typographical errors, sentences that did not make sense, or contradictory information. The RAs then prompted the students to attend for errors in the text and to underline any places in the passage where they lost the meaning or believed there was a problem with the text. The RAs also told the students to underline sentences containing any unknown words. After silent reading was completed, the pairs of sixth graders took turns orally reading a sentence, thinking aloud about the meaning, and telling what they were doing to understand the text better. The RAs kept a written record of the sixth graders\' miscues while reading orally. When the participants\' think-aloud verbalizations indicated an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of the text, explicit instruction was initiated in one of the four strategic areas (see Table 24). These circumstances included students\' (a)[¬e]""', 'Page 40:\n[¬s]""miscues in oral reading without self-correction, (b) appeals for help, (c) verbalization of incorrect information or understanding of text, (c) failure to acknowledge or correct embedded errors in the text indicating a failure to monitor, or (e) other behaviors that indicated a lack of understanding of a word or section of text. Based on observations of students\' reading behavior, the RAs selected a strategic activity (e.g., connecting) that would be beneficial and supported its use. Each time RAs initiated strategy instruction they briefly named the strategy and told its purpose (Baumann et al., 1993; Bereiter & Bird, 1985). Although strategy use was promoted throughout the oral reading and thinking- aloud phase, special attention was given to sections of text with embedded errors. If participants had not underlined an embedded error, or if think-aloud statements indicated a failure to understand the text, RAs prompted the readers to monitor and repair the error. The RAs also encouraged flexible use of strategies. For example, if a student only explained, the RAs challenged the student to try to connect as well. If a participant relied largely on personal connections that were only distantly related to the text (Cote & Goldman, 1999), the RAs encouraged them to try relevant text-to-text connections instead. The RAs\' objective was to break into the rigidity of the participants\' strategic behavior, supplementing useful strategies and supplanting less useful ones.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 15:\n[¬s]""Thinking aloud was selected and implemented as an intervention to guide and focus instructors\' intervention in science text comprehension and strategy use, and to promote students\' awareness of comprehension breakdowns and initiation of self- regulatory processes.[¬e]""']",NA,,['University/ researcher design'],NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 44:\n[¬s]""Training.

The sessions were highly interactive, and the Oxford team leveraged the experience and knowledge of the trainers by soliciting feedback and applying that feedback in subsequent days of training. For example, the trainers encouraged the Oxford team to make explicit how each practical that was shared with the teachers linked to the key programme elements (illustrated in Figure 1). Discussions with the trainers also included thoughts on what to prioritise from the content of the latest national curriculum and how to infuse that content into the design of the CPD days.

Students were taught, for instance, how to map ideas in a passage, the difference between superordinate and subordinate informa- tion, different paragraph functions in a text (e.g., introductory, explanatory, narrative, deÞnitional, transitional), different organizational patterns in text (e.g., chronological, cause Ðeffect, compareÐ contrast), different patterns of cohesive relationship among text elements (e.g., ellipsis, anaphora), and how to recognize signal words that give clues to the authorÕs plan and overall text organization.

When a child offers a response, the teacher adds information to the response so that all the children can hear the details of the story. Repeat.

For this story, the topic selection is: MOOSE. 2. The teacher should then write the word, MOOSE, at the top of the chalkboard in big, bold letters. At this point, the teacher should point to the word and ask the students if anyone knows what that word is. When someone responds by reading the word, MOOSE, the teacher should indicate that this was an appropriate response, (i.e., Sue, that was right. You have done very well.) The teacher should then ask the students if anyone knows what a moose is?

Tell them that you would like for them to think about all the words that remind them of a moose (i.e., teacher could say, for example, when I see the word moose, I think of the word, deer). Write your response on the board. 5. Pause for a few minutes to allow the students time to think about your response. 6. Then ask the students to raise their hands when they have a word that they would like for you to add to the list. Words that you want to be included in this list are: stomach, throat, tongue, forehead, better, four, breakfast, hungry, and hairy (see part 8). 7. Students\' should generate enough words to allow for grouping, (i.e., 15-20 words would be adequate). 8. In the event that the class might fail to include the necessary words, you may wish to lead them into the inclusion of these words through the following cues (tell[¬e]""', 'Page 131:\n[¬s]""students that these are words they will encounter when they, read their story about a moose)[¬e]""', 'Page 132:\n[¬s]""9. Next, tell the students to look at the words and see if there is any way they could put these words into smaller groups?

Once you have placed these words into their respective groups, ask the students if they could give you a title for each small group of words. For example, the words tongue and throat might be given the title, ""PARTS OF THE MOUTH"". 11. Once you have completed this activity, the students should tell you why they chose the headings they did. Much of this may take place during #10, above, in that students may have to persuade their peers that their particular heading is appropriate and tell them why.
