42059739,Beach (2004),2004,"Although there is considerable evidence linking phonological awareness to early reading performance, few research studies have been conducted to measure early interventions of explicit phonological awareness instruction, including parents as teachers, with 4- and 5-year-old prekindergarten children  among those that have been completed, research methods have often been seriously flawed. The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.","['Parental engagement', 'Phonics', 'Summer schools']",NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],"['Page 55:\n[¬s]""The independent variable in this study was the LCSD Kindergarten\nReadiness Summer Program.

43099917,Beattie (2000),2000,"There is a large body of research that implicates difficulty with phonological processing as the fundamental deficit in many children with reading and language impairments. Research indicates that difficulty with the ability to discriminate acoustic information that enters the nervous system in rapid succession (within a time frame of milliseconds) interferes with the development of phonological processes (Tallal, Miller, & Fitch, 1993). This temporal processing deficit may result in more global language impairments, such as receptive language disorders and reading disabilities.  This experimental study examined the effects of two intensive computer-based language interventions on receptive language, phonemic awareness, reading, and spelling achievement. One language intervention is called Fast ForWord (FF), a CD-ROM and Internet-based training program developed to increase students' ability to process rapid, successive acoustic information and understand spoken language. Fast ForWord is based on twenty years of research in neural plasticity and language impairments. Fast ForWord was compared to a language arts computer-based intervention, SuccessMaker (SM). SuccessMaker employs direct reading and spelling exercises and practice.  This study contrasted the effectiveness of the two intervention approaches with sixty-four adolescents from three local school divisions. ANOVA and ANCOVA procedures were used to examine the effects of FF and SM, as well as combinations of SM and FF on measures of receptive language, phonemic awareness reading, and spelling. A control group was used for further comparison.

Method  In the instructional experiment, 96 second graders with low reading achievement were randomly assigned to one of four conditions  (a) explicit and reflective word recognition, (b) explicit and reflective reading comprehension, (c) combined explicit word recognition and explicit reading comprehension, or (d) treated control that only practiced reading skills without any instruction. In the extension study, these conditions were compared to an untreated control group of 29 second graders. Results  In the instructional experiment, combined word recognition and reading comprehension treatment increased phonological decoding (pronouncing pseudowords) significantly more than the treated control or word recognition only treatment and had the highest effect size. The comprehension only treatment was not significantly different from the treated control. In the extension study, (a) the treated children receiving supplemental instruction improved significantly more in phonological decoding and reading real words than did those in the regular program, and (b) the combined word recognition and reading comprehension treatment, which was explicit, had the highest effect sizes for both pseudoword and real-word reading.

Identical information was gathered in each project concerning teacher, school, and community characteristics and common experimental guidelines were followed in all 27 studies. Results of the correlation analysis revealed that the ability to recognize letters of the alphabet prior to the beginning of reading instruction was the single best predictor of first-grade reading achievement. The analysis of methodology indicated that the various non-basal instructional programs tended to be superior to basal programs as measured by word recognition skills of pupils after one year of reading instruction. Differences between basal and non-basal programs were less consistent when measures of comprehension, spelling, rate of accuracy of reading, and word study skills constituted the criterion of reading achievement.

The study addressed the question  To what extent does an extended school year program for kindergartners, featuring phonemic awareness instruction, improve children's reading proficiency in the 1st and 2nd grade? Utilizing two district made surveys, the Phonemic Awareness Interview (PAI) and the Literacy Curriculum Scale (LCS) as pre-tests, 62 children from the 1997–1998 kindergarten cohort of 238 children were identified as exhibiting literacy and phonemic awareness deficits  they were invited to participate in the Kinder Camp Program. Of the 62 children invited 40 elected to participate and were identified as the Intervention group  22 children chose not to take part in the program and were identified as the Control group. Daily instruction in phonemic awareness as well as oral and written language activities were integral components of the five-week Kinder Camp Program. The program provided literacy enhancement through direct instruction and open-ended discovery “centers”. Children participated individually or in groups never exceeding 10. Teachers worked closely with parents at home and in the classroom. The Phonemic Awareness Interview post-test, five Marie Clay reading surveys and five Harcourt Brace Signatures© reading tests were administered at various times during the cohort's first and second grade school years as outcome assessments. A comparison was made of the Intervention and Control groups on those 11 outcome assessments. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used with the PAI pre-test and the LCS scores as covariates. The results indicate that the Intervention group scored significantly higher than the Control group on the Phonemic Awareness Interview post-test. The outcomes of the Marie Clay reading surveys and the Harcourt Brace Signatures© reading tests did not yield significant differences between the two groups.","['Summer schools', 'Phonics']",NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['5', '6']",NA,NA,,5,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]"" BRADFORDElEM.

In particular, the effects of a music program and a phonological skills program on phonological awareness were compared. If language and music share basic processing mechanisms, the effect of both programs on enhancing phonological awareness should be similar. Forty-one preschoolers (22 boys) were randomly assigned to a phonological skills program, a music program, and a control group that received sports training (from which no effect was expected). Preschoolers were trained for 10 min on a daily basis over a period of 20 weeks. In a pretest, no differences were found between the three groups in regard to age, gender, intelligence, socioeconomic status, and phonological awareness. Children in the phonological skills group and the music group showed significant increases in phonological awareness from pre- to post-test. The children in the sports group did not show a significant increase from pre- to post-test. The enhancement of phonological awareness was basically driven by positive effects of the music program and the phonological skills program on phonological awareness for large phonological units. The data suggests that phonological awareness can be trained with a phonological skills program as well as a music program.

43099807,Eldredge (1991),1991,"The “whole language” movement is the most discussed trend in language arts education today. Most educators resonate with classroom practices proposed by whole language advocates. Some, however, believe that the position taken against the direct teaching of phonics skills by whole language enthusiasts is ill‐advised, especially for first‐grade children. A recent review of studies comparing whole language approaches with basal approaches suggests that whole language approaches may not be as effective as basals in helping students master the word recognition skills prerequisite to effective comprehension. A modified whole language approach, focusing more directly on word recognition skills, was developed, implemented, and tested in three first‐grade classrooms in Provo, Utah. Nine of ten characteristics generally associated with whole language approaches were kept intact in the modified program. However, a daily 15‐minute period of total class phonics instruction was added to the program, which is not characteristic of whole language approaches. The year‐long study compared the reading achievement effects of the “modified whole language” approach implemented in three classrooms in one school with those obtained from a popular basal approach implemented in three classrooms in a second school in the same school district. Both schools were matched according to student achievement, socio‐economic background, and student turnover. A posttest‐only control group with a pretest covariate research design was used. Vocabulary and comprehension were measured using the Gates‐MacGinitie Reading Test, Level A, Form 1. Phonics and reading attitudes were measured using author‐developed instruments.

Students' activities in 20 classrooms were observed, confirming that half of the classrooms followed an individualized language-experience approach and half a decoding-oriented basal reader approach. Year-end testing of the students revealed basic level reading skill to be less universally acquired in the language-experience group, but no difference in information processing and linguistic abilities between the two groups. In addition, while the various cognitive measures generally correlated positively with reading in the decoding-oriented group, significant negative correlations between linguistic ability and reading skill were observed in the language-experience group. It is argued that linguistic ability facilitates beginning reading only after a threshold of print-specific skills is acquired, and that the observed difference between the two groups stemmed primarily from their varying emphasis on systematic instruction, with corrective feedback, of these print-specific skills.",['Phonics'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['UK (Select all that apply)'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 6:\n[¬s]""le.

The present research examines the impact of one such approach, Direct Phonics (Wilson and Reason, 2003). Direct Phonics was introduced in 6 schools during 2002-2003 involving 15 teachers and 11 teaching assistants working with 16 groups of children in total. Quantitative data was obtained for a total of 40 children aged between 72 - 89 months, on the following pre and post intervention measures  receptive language as measured by the BPVS, phonological skills as measured by the PhAB, basic word recognition as measured by the WORD, various curriculum-based measures relating to letter and word knowledge. Qualitative data was obtained through discussions with the teaching staff, their observations and records and examples of the pupils' work. Curriculum-based measures drawing on the content of Direct Phonics demonstrated most convincing progress. There were also significant gains in scores on the WORD test but a calculation of effect size did not indicate that the children were 'catching up' with their age peers. It was argued that, in comparison with curriculum-based assessments, standardised tests were 'blunt' measures of progress for children in the beginning stages of literacy learning. Before the intervention, many of the children demonstrated phonological weaknesses on the PhAB test. The children's scores improved significantly on the sample of subtests administered post-intervention. Correlational analysis showed that PhAB scores were not related to children's curriculum-based measures of progress or their progress on the WORD test. BPVS as a baseline measure of receptive vocabulary was significantly related to the curriculum-based outcome measures. Case examples of two children making slow progress illustrated how their learning was a function of various factors including the pupils' motivation, language skills, their phonological profiles and their school attendance.",['Phonics'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 20:\n[¬s]""small group of 6 primary schools[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '8']","['Page 108:\n[¬s]""All the pupils were from the key stage 1 department of the primary schools.\nWhen the intervention began, the mean age was 79 months; the youngest pupil\nwas 72 months and the oldest was 89 months.[¬e]""']",NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,6,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Regression discontinuity,"['Page 97:\n[¬s]""Four of the subtests were followed up; alliteration, rhyme,\nnaming speed pictures and nonword reading.

43099907,Ford (2009),2009,"Many older students and young adults leave high school without adequate reading ability to be successful as they transition into college or employment. Researchers report that the level of nearly illiteracy has reached a rate that threatens the economy and health of the nation. This study was founded on the reading stages scheme suggested by Chall that suggests that many older students struggle because they are deficient in, or lack, the phonological awareness skills, particularly phonemic awareness, that are normally acquired in Chall’s pre-reading and decoding stages of reading. This study explored the possible benefit of instruction in a specific method of decoding upon the general reading skills of struggling adolescent readers.  The study was conducted in an alternative high school using two groups with random assignment, pre- and posttests. The intervention was instruction in the backward-chaining method of decoding multisyllable words (as developed by Lewkowicz) followed by practice with computer-assisted instruction, using the Word Workout program.  Pre- and posttest results for the two groups were compared in the areas of phonological awareness, decoding, fluency, and silent-reading comprehension. Nonparametric statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney U-test found a statistically significant difference in phonemic awareness after the intervention. There were moderate to large effect sizes found in single-word decoding and in silent-reading comprehension.

Significant improvements in reading and spelling were found in the children who had followed the PAT programme. In addition to this, phonological skills such as rhyme fluency and spoonerisms, as measured by the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhAB), also showed significant improvement.

38296617,Gorard (2014),2014,"Switch-on Reading is an intensive 10-week literacy intervention. It is delivered on a one to one basis by staff, most commonly teaching assistants, who have been trained in the approach. The purpose of Switch-on is to achieve functional literacy for as many pupils as possible, and so to close the reading achievement gap for vulnerable children working below age-expected levels. It is inspired by the well- established intervention Reading Recovery, which is teacher led and delivered over a 12-20 week period. In this evaluation, the programme involved regular sessions for pupils who had not achieved Level 4 English at Key Stage 2. The identified pupils in Year 7 attended regular 20-minute reading sessions over the course of the Spring term. The students were removed from class to attend the sessions, which aimed to improve their reading comprehension and fluency. Each session required students to read from four different books graded on the basis of their difficulty. Training and support for staff was provided by the Every Child a Reader staff of Nottinghamshire Local Authority. The overall result was an effect size of +0.24, based on the pooled standard deviation of the post-test score for both groups, meaning that the programme made a noticeable positive impact. This effect can be envisaged as suggesting that on average pupils receiving the intervention would make approximately three additional months’ progress over the course of a year compared to similar pupils who did not. The evaluation identified positive results for all groups of pupils (defined by sex, first language, ethnicity, special educational needs, free school meal eligibility and measured attainment at the outset). However, it is important to note that conclusions about specific groups of pupils are more tentative than the overall finding, because the study was primarily designed to test the average impact on all identified children.","['Teaching assistants', 'One to one tuition', 'Phonics']",NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12']",NA,NA,,NA,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""19 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""19 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,"['Page 6:\n[¬s]"" in 19 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Y7 classes from 19 secondary schools.,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 10:\n[¬s]"" Nineteen schools were recruited to take part in the intervention.

Teaching in these groups begins with recognition, practice and blending of sounds and graphemes, based on a set of module booklets.

Of the single cohort of kindergarten students (N = 35) participating, eight students received fall intervention from a trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and winter intervention using ""Road to the Code"" and six students received winter intervention from the trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"". The first research question investigated early literacy skills achievement, as measured by the Dynamic Indicator of Basic Literacy Skills, between treatment and comparison groups using two commercially available interventions  ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and ""Road to the Code"". The second research question examined learner characteristics and demographics as explanatory variables for early literacy skills achievement of the study sample. Study findings indicate that all treatment participants made statistically significant gains in early literacy skills achievement, generally kept pace with their non-at-risk peers, but that neither treatment closed the achievement gap between at-risk and not-at-risk for reading difficulty participants.

Methods  A sample (N = 77) of children drawn from 14 schools representing those with the weakest reading skills were randomly allocated to one of two groups. A 20-week intervention group received the intervention for two consecutive 10-week periods, while a 10-week intervention group only received the intervention for the second 10 weeks of the study. The programme was delivered in daily 20-minute sessions that alternated between small group (N = 3) and individual teaching. The programme combined phoneme awareness training, word and text reading, and phonological linkage exercises. Results  The children receiving the intervention during the first 10-week period made significantly more progress on measures of letter knowledge, single word reading, and phoneme awareness than children not receiving the intervention. However, the children who only received the intervention during the second 10-week period made rapid progress and appeared to catch up with the children who had been given the more prolonged intervention. Failure to respond to the intervention was predicted by poor initial literacy skills and being in receipt of free school meals. Conclusion  A reading intervention programme delivered on a daily basis by trained teaching assistants is an effective intervention for children who show reading delays at the end of their first year in school. However, around one-quarter of the children did not respond to this intervention and these children would appear to need more intensive or more prolonged help to improve their reading skills.

Additionally, all students received classroom phonological awareness programming. Lessons were scripted and contained examples, practice, and review. Children were assessed at pre-intervention on three phonological awareness and three alphabetic measures. Probes were administered at three points during the intervention and at two post-intervention maintenance points. Results indicated statistically significant group performance for children in the intervention group on measures of initial sound fluency, phonemic segmentation, and nonsense word fluency skills using measures designed to show change in these skills over time. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the norm-referenced, standardized measures of phonological awareness and print knowledge and on letter naming fluency at the end of the intervention.

Approximately 400 children were pre-tested, 95 were assigned to Reading Recovery, 97 to Phonological Training and the remainder acted as controls. In the short and medium term both interventions significantly improved aspects of children’s reading, Reading Recovery having a broader and more powerful effect.

Group achievement data were also available for the at-risk sample and a randomly selected group of not-at-risk children matched to the at-risk controls. The only significant finding that emerged involved consistently higher word attack scores for chil- dren in the phonetic tutoring group over a 2-year period. When the effects of the intervention were examined within groups of vulnerable readers, marginally at-risk children in the phonetic group appeared to have profited the most from one-to- one tutoring, demonstrating significantly higher performance on word attack, phonetic analysis, and the test of written spelling. Finally, com- parisons of at-risk and not-at-risk children in- dicted significantly lower academic performance for the at-risk group over a 2-year period.

43099974,Marion (2004),2004,"The purpose of this study was to compare the academic achievement of students through the use of standardized testing to examine the relationship of participation in a computer-based phonics instructional system called Fast ForWord®. The sample included students enrolled in the fifth and sixth grades at four elementary schools in the Grainger County, Tennessee, school system. The comparison group consisted of same-grade peers at the four elementary schools in Grainger County who were not enrolled in the Fast ForWord® program. Students' scores were compared using the 2003 Terra Nova standardized assessment test and using their 2001 and 2002 test scores as a control. Comparisons were made using the reading, language, math, science, and social studies subsections of the Terra Nova. Differences between students who received Fast ForWord® and students who did not receive Fast ForWord® were analyzed. The study examined the variables of gender, school enrollment, socioeconomic status, time of intervention, and ability grouping. These variables were examined with analysis of covariance to determine differences. When differences did exist between groups, posthoc tests were used to determine specific differences between groups. The findings indicated that there were measurable differences in the performance of students who received Fast ForWord® compared to students who did not receive Fast ForWord®. Significant differences were found in reading and language subsections of the Terra Nova test for students who had participated in the Fast ForWord® reading program. The findings from the examination of other variables indicated that gender as well as gender x the intervention (Fast ForWord®) interaction were the same for females and males in their performance on the Terra Nova. The findings from the variable socioeconomic status were determined using system data for free/reduced or paid meals. The study determined that socioeconomic status did not significantly affect scores of students including the socioeconomic status x the intervention interaction.

43099968,Mathes (1998),1998,"THIS RESEARCH examines the effectiveness of Peer-Assisted Learning Strategies for First-Grade Readers (First-Grade PALS) as a tool for enhancing the reading achievement of different learner types, particularly low-achieving students, representing the range of academic diversity typically present in primary grade classrooms. First-Grade PALS helps teachers to accommodate this diversity (a) by decentering instruction through peer mediation so that students become more actively involved in the learning process, (b) by including provisions for integrating phonological and alphabetic skills into the decoding of words in connected text, and (c) by providing extensive and repeated exposure to a variety of children's literature. In this research, the efficacy and feasibility of First-Grade PALS were examined in naturally constituted, academically heterogeneous first-grade classes, during time normally allocated for reading instruction. Twenty first-grade teachers and 96 first-grade students (46 low, 20 average-, and 20 high-achieving) participated. Ten teachers in- corporated First-Grade PALS into their reading program  10 contin- ued to teach reading as usual. Data collected included (a) time-series phonological awareness and reading fluency data and (b) pre- and post-measures of concepts of print, decoding, fluency, and compre- hension.

Results indicate that 1st-Grade PALS, on average, enhanced reading performance of students both in terms of statistical significance and in terms of educational relevance, although not equally for all learner types, closely replicating findings from our previous studies.

The America Reads Challenge (ARC), a federal grassroots call to action, is an unprecedented national campaign that challenges every American to help all our children learn to read, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency. Specifically, ARC proposes the use of adult volunteers to tutor children during and after school. Nationwide, thousands of ARC tutors serve their communities through Federal Work Study (FWS), AmeriCorps, VISTA, National Senior Service Corps, and Learn & Serve America. As a result of increased funding of these service organizations, hundreds of thousands of tutors are being sent into American public schools. Currently, 20,000 students at 1,100 colleges teach elementary students through the FWS program (“Rave Reviews,” 1999). Although volunteer tutors are not a new concept (Wasik, 1998), the sudden surge of thousands of volunteers in our public school systems is a phenomenon in need of study.

It is based on a course book created by Irina Tyk, and was delivered in this evaluation by Real Action, a charity based in London. Real Action staff recruited and trained practitioners to deliver the intervention. These practitioners worked with trained teaching assistants to teach classes of six to eight pupils, although some groups were larger. Pupils were eligible for participation in the trial if they did not reach level 4 in their Key Stage 2 SATs or their reading skills were at least a year behind their chronological age. The evaluation was set up as a randomised controlled trial, which compared the progress of pupils who received Butterfly Phonics to a ""business-as-usual"" control group. Key conclusions include  (1) This evaluation provided evidence of promise  there was a positive, statistically significant effect on the primary outcome measure of reading comprehension. However, this effect size was lower than the minimum detectable effect size of the trial, so we cannot confidently conclude that the effect was due to the intervention and did not occur by chance  (2) The secondary outcome measures indicated positive impacts on children's literacy skills, but these were not statistically significant  (3) This intervention is recommended to take place during the school day, when it is easier to secure sustained co-operation and support from school staff. Where that support was present, the intervention was able to progress more satisfactorily than in schools where it was lacking  (4) Schools should ensure that people delivering the intervention receive training in the Butterfly method so that it is implemented as intended  and (5) Further research could investigate the intervention's impact on early readers.

Finally, the authors chose to use a modified form of Interactive Book Reading as their comparison (control) condition to (a) control for supplemental instruction time and consistency, and (b) provide an alternative intervention approach appropriate for preschoolers. Indeed, studies support the benefit of interactive storybook reading for building emergent literacy skills  however, supplemental instruction that focuses on vocabulary acquisition has not, to date, been tested against explicit supplemental instruction in PA focused instruction with diverse (i.e., low socioeconomic, limited English proficiency) preschool children. Thus, this study also provides information regarding the relative impact of two approaches on preschoolers' PA and alphabetic and vocabulary knowledge. The primary research questions for the current study were  (a) does a supplemental PA focused intervention implemented by paraeducators have a direct, positive impact on at-risk preschool children's literacy outcomes?, and (b) does the intervention have a unique impact on children's outcomes, after controlling for pretest skill, classroom and home literacy environments, and treatment fidelity?

It teaches pupils to blend phonemes (combine letter sounds into words), segment phonemes (separate words into letter sounds), and memorise particular words so they can be understood without needing to use phonics strategies to decode them. The intervention matches books to pupils according to their reading ability, which pupils then read to a teaching assistant (TA), so is intended to also support the development of their comprehension skills. In this evaluation, the intervention was delivered through two 15-minute sessions per week over 30 weeks at the transition from primary to secondary school, with a break for the summer holidays. Pupils were identified by their Year 6 teachers in their feeder primary schools as being struggling readers who were predicted to achieve below level 4b in reading. Each secondary school employed two part-time TAs to deliver the intervention in the last few weeks of Year 6 and after the pupils transitioned to secondary school. The TAs delivering Catch Up Literacy were supplied with detailed session plans and received three half-day training sessions led by Catch Up.

38296672,Sheard (2015),2015,"Units of Sound (UofS) is a computer-based programme designed to help struggling readers with their reading and spelling skills. It is a structured, multisensory programme that covers reading and spelling from simple phonics skills through to adult reading levels. It involves a high level of independent work by the student, with small groups of students supervised by a teacher or teaching assistant. Each ‘unit of sound’ (or phonic code) is introduced separately, then used in words, and then sentences. This evaluation assessed the reading ability of 786 Year 7 students in 45 schools. Students were randomly assigned within the schools to receive the intervention if they had scored below Level 4 on their Key Stage 2 SATs. The evaluation was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of 23 projects focused on literacy catch-up at the primary-secondary transition for students who did not achieve Level 4 in English by the end of Key Stage 2. Two staff members in each school were identified to implement the interventions with groups of approximately five Year 7 students at a time. The designated teachers/teaching assistants in the participating schools undertook the 10-hour initial online training in UofS. Of the 45 schools that took part in the study, 31 had four sessions of additional face-to-face training and support from Dyslexia Action (DA) coaches and 14 had only online distance training and support instead of face-to-face support. Students spent one 60-minute session with the teaching assistant present and a further 30-minute session on another day working independently on the material covered with the teaching assistant. Schools varied in how they allocated the time. The intervention lasted for 18 weeks. Students were evaluated at baseline on the New Group Reading Test (NGRT) and then at follow-up on the NGRT and the Single Word Spelling Test (SWST). A light-touch process evaluation was conducted to determine teaching assistants’ and students’ perceptions of the programme. This included surveys of teaching staff and students and interviews with the DA coaches.","['Small group tuition', 'Phonics', 'Teaching assistants']",NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12']",NA,NA,,45,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""45 schools[¬e]""']",,45,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" 45 schools[¬e]""']",,45,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""45 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],"Individual students were eligible, not entire classes",NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""The IEE research team was to randomly select on average 20 students from each school who had achieved below Level 4 on the Key Stage 2 SATs in reading, and then randomly from those that met the criteria.

What is the impact of being in one of the remedial reading programs that focuses primarily on developing word-level skills, considered as a group, relative to the instruction provided by the schools? What is the impact of being in each of the four particular remedial reading interventions, considered individually, relative to the instruction provided by the schools? • Do the impacts of programs vary across students with different baseline characteristics? • To what extent can the instruction provided in this study close the reading gap and bring struggling readers within the normal range, relative to the instruction provided by their schools? To answer these questions, the impact study was based on a scientifically rigorous design—an experimental design that uses random assignment at two levels  (1) 50 schools from 27 school districts were randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in grades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group. Students assigned to the intervention group (treatment group) were placed by the program providers and local coordinators into instructional groups of three students. Students in the control groups received the same instruction in reading that they would have ordinarily received. Children were defined as eligible if they were identified by their teachers as struggling readers and if they scored at or below the 30th percentile on a word-level reading test and at or above the 5th percentile on a vocabulary test. From an original pool of 1,576 3rd and 5th grade students identified as struggling readers, 1,042 also met the test-score criteria. Of these eligible students, 772 were given permission by their parents to participate in the evaluation. The second element of the evaluation is an implementation study that has two components  (1) an exploration of the similarities and differences in reading instruction offered in the four interventions and (2) a description of the regular instruction that students in the control group received in the absence of the interventions and the regular instruction received by the treatment group beyond the interventions. Test data and other information on students, parents, teachers, classrooms, and schools is being collected several times over a three-year period. Key data collection points pertinent to this summary report include the period just before the interventions began, when baseline information was collected, and the period immediately after the interventions ended, when follow-up data were collected. Additional follow-up data for students and teachers are being collected in 2005 and again in 2006.",['Phonics'],NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""A Report Prepared for IES\nby the Corporation for the Advancement of Policy Evaluation[¬e]""']",NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 8:\n[¬s]""elementary school[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,"The intervention requires moderate commitment, resources and specialism from schools as it involves 1 50 minute session each day or 90 hours tuition over 6 months from trained but not specialist skilled teachers",,"['9', '10']",NA,NA,,50,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""(1) 50 schools from 27 school districts\nwere randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in\ngrades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group[¬e]""']",,50,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""(1) 50 schools from 27 school districts\nwere randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in\ngrades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group[¬e]""']",,50,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""(1) 50 schools from 27 school districts\nwere randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in\ngrades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,"EPPI comments instruct coding only, Spell Read P.A.T. vs control",,Random (please specify),"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""random assignment at two levels: (1) 50 schools from 27 school districts\nwere randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in\ngrades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group.[¬e]""']",NA,,Individual,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""within each school, eligible children in\ngrades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group[¬e]""', 'Page 9:\n[¬s]""random assignment at two levels: (1) 50 schools from 27 school districts\nwere randomly assigned to one of the four interventions[¬e]""']",NA,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""the impact study was based on a scientifically rigorous design—an\nexperimental design that uses random assignment at two levels: (1) 50 schools from 27 school districts\nwere randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in\ngrades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group[¬e]""']",NA,,Yes,"['Page 82:\n[¬s]""In this evaluation, a small number\nof students assigned to the treatment group (13 students, or less than 1 percent) did not receive any\ninstruction and are labeled as no-shows.[¬e]""', 'Page 9:\n[¬s]""the impact study was based on a scientifically rigorous design—an experimental design that uses random assignment at two levels: (1) 50 schools from 27 school districts were randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in grades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group""\n""Children were defined as eligible if they were\nidentified by their teachers as struggling readers and if they scored at or below the 30th percentile on a\nword-level reading test and at or above the 5th percentile on a vocabulary test.

Thirty children aged 5.1-6.0 (15 in each of two schools) were assigned to an experimental or control group and compared be- fore and after a 12-week intervention on measures of phonological processing skills and reading. There were no pretreatment differences between groups. The experimental intervention was based on findings of (a) early developmental phases in phonological recoding, (b) reciprocal development between phoneme awareness and phonological recoding, and (c) reciprocal development between phonological processing skills and early reading. The instruction was designed to facilitate the gradually expanding use of letter-phoneme relationships in early read- ing and spelling. The results indicated that, at posttest, the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group on the measures of phonolog- ical processing skills and in reading.

43099780,Wilson (1998),1998,"The purpose of this study was to determine if there were significant differences in word recognition skills depending on whether students were instructed in a WL or a PSB classroom. With the exception of the cloze activity no significant mean differences were found. Cloze activities are used in the WL classrooms as an explicit instructional tool but not in the PSB classrooms. Therefore, the significant findings for this variable may reflect the effect specific instructional techniques have on students' performance. Cloze activities in part reflect the ability of readers to use prediction as they read. Thus, although word recognition was a part of this task, so was prediction, and students from the WL classrooms demonstrated significantly better prediction abilities. There were no other converging findings indicating that differences in instructional practice produced differences in the type of information used in word recognition. The major purpose of the study was to determine whether students from WL classrooms would differ in word recognition abilities compared with those from PSB classrooms. The results suggest that few overall differences existed. Students taught in a program focused on using contextual information (WL) performed significantly better on only one task measuring use of this information for word identification than students taught in a program that focused on graphic information (PSB). As well, students taught in the PSB approach did not use graphic information significantly more for word identification than students taught in a WL approach. In terms of word identification, the performance of the two groups was more similar than different. Alternatively, there is also evidence that indicates teachers adjust their reading programs and integrate aspects of each approach. [Stanovich, K.E.] (1994) stated that teachers are pragmatists and that they teach what works. By its nature pragmatism opposes rigidity in philosophical orientation and allows flexibility in teachers' choices of instructional tools. This observation is consistent with the findings of [Pressley] and [Rankin] (1994) where the WL teachers in their sample incorporated a number of teaching practices that included the direct instruction of letter-sound correspondences. Although the WL teachers indicated that they generally taught discrete skills in the context of continuous text, they also taught discrete skills in isolation, especially for weak readers. The converse was also true where supporters of direct phonic instruction used context as a vehicle for the teaching of specific phonetic strategies (Pressley & Rankin, 1994). Similarities in classroom practices were also noted by [Sacks] and Mergendoller (1997) in their examination of the relationship between a teacher's theoretical approach and student achievement. They found many similarities between WL and PSB classrooms, including type of classroom activities and time spent involved in various activities, although they did note that ""there were subtle, and meaningful differences in the classroom literacy experiences of students"" (p. 734).",['Phonics'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['Canada'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8']",NA,NA,,4,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools:[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools:[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,5,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,"There were two groups, neither were labelled as control however.",,Retrospective Quasi Experimental Design (QED),"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools: three where the teachers followed a WL, literature-based\napproach and two where the teachers used a PSB, sequential approach to instruction[¬e]""']",NA,,N,NA,NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""A quasi experimental design was chosen\nfor this study.[¬e]""']",NA,,Not applicable,NA,NA,
38296699,Worth (2018),2018,"GraphoGame Rime is a computer game designed to teach pupils to read by developing their phonological awareness and phonic skills. Originally developed by a Finnish University, the program underpinning the game can analyse performance and constantly adjust the difficulty of the game content to match the learner’s ability. The English version of GraphoGame Rime was developed to implement the ‘rhyme analogy’ research by educational neuroscientist Usha Goswami, based at the University of Cambridge. The intervention aimed to improve the reading ability of a group of pupils who were identified as having low literacy skills, as measured by the phonics screening check taken at the end of Year 1. The intervention was delivered by teachers and teaching assistants. Training, technical support and some delivery support was provided by researchers from the University of Cambridge. This study was an efficacy trial of the GraphoGame Rime intervention, carried out during one spring term with 398 Year 2 pupils in 15 primary schools in Cambridgeshire. It was a pupil-randomised controlled trial designed to determine the impact of the intervention on the pupils’ reading attainment and was conducted with two cohorts of pupils over two years. The primary outcome was the raw score on the New Group Reading Test, administered by NFER test administrators within a month of the intervention ending, and provided by GL Assessment. A process evaluation used case-study visits, telephone interviews and analysis of data on pupils’ usage of the game to capture the perceptions and experiences of participating teaching staff and pupils. The intervention was implemented in schools during the 2015/16 and 2016/17 academic years.
