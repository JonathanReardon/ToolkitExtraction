The groups differed in how the words were grouped during learning, and in the method of instruction.

For the initial color training trials, the common rime segment for each family block was written in red to highlight the shared orthographic segment. The four cards of a block were displayed together in front of the child. On the very first presentation of the word set on Day 1 only, the experimenter pronounced the highlighted segment and then read each word by segmenting it into the onset and rime units and then blending it into whole word. For example, this is an, so these words are c an can, p an pan, b an ban, fan fan.

On each day of training, children in all groups read once only the entire set of 32 words printed on individual index cards. The groups differed in how the words were grouped during learning, and in the method of instruction.  For the Rime training condition, the 32 words were arranged so that the 4 words of a rime family were shown together. That is, each day the children read eight rime families, with the four members of each family presented as a block. For the initial color training trials, the common rime segment for each family block was written in red to highlight the shared orthographic segment. The four cards of a block were displayed together in front of the child. On the very first presentation of the word set on Day 1 only, the experimenter pronounced the highlighted segment and then read each word by segmenting it into the onset and rime units and then blending it into whole word. For example, this is an, so these words are c an can, p an pan, b an ban, f an fan. The experimenter segmented and blended all 32 words on the initial presentation, but thereafter the children attempted to pronounce the color-highlighted words once a day for 15 days or until the child pronounced all 32 words correctly on 2 successive days. Each day the child was required to first respond with the onset rime units and then the blended word. The experimenter provided segmented and blended feedback only when the child could not pronounce a word or pronounced it incorrectly. Following the 15 color trial days or when criterion was met, there were 10 black and white trials where the child pronounced the 32 words printed in black ink once a day. The words remained in their family blocks. Again, black and white trials ended before the maximum of 10 trials if the child pronounced the set correctly on 2 successive days. Segmented and blended correction occurred for any missed or mispronounced words.   In the Whole Word training condition, the four words per block were randomly selected, with the restriction that no family members could occur in the same block, and the same eight random blocks were read each day of training.

The mean time for the whole intervention delivery was 20 hours during this evaluation.""\n""In the first lessons of the intervention, short phrases and sentences constitute the focus of the lesson, with an emphasis on phoneme blending. Longer passages are central to later lessons, especially in the Advanced Butterfly Reader. The excerpt forming the main topic of the lesson is read aloud by the teacher towards the beginning of the lesson so that the pupils appreciate the context, which is usually historical, and gain the gist of the passage. This aspect of Butterfly instruction sets it apart from many purely phonics schemes which may not spend as much time as Butterfly in overtly teaching an understanding of the global aspects of a text. A class discussion of the gist and meaning of the passage is encouraged by the teacher, who picks on individuals to ask for their contributions, in addition to pupils volunteering their own contributions. This direct questioning of pupils at random is intended to engage everyone and to check on the level of understanding of individuals. Misconceptions can be identified by the teacher and there is scope to discuss them and revisit them later in the lesson or in another lesson. Pupils are then asked to read a section of the text and their mistakes are corrected by the teacher, who reminds the class of the spelling, pronunciation, and grammatical rules they have encountered previously as well as introducing new ones. This allows the pupils to question the teacher about literacy rules that they are not clear about, or meanings that require clarification. A period of writing, using the new vocabulary learnt, is included. This may be dictation from the passage or answering questions on it or making up some sentences of their own. Homework may be given in connection with the subject of the lesson. An interesting feature of the Butterfly programme is the continuation of the phonics approaches of early reading into the essentially comprehension-based Advanced Butterfly Reader lessons. There is an emphasis on the new vocabulary encountered in each lesson which concentrates on the sound patterns in those new words, for example, ‘imminent’, ‘eminent’, ‘persistent’. This feature is thought by the project to be unique to the scheme. These words are introduced at the start of the lesson; some of them can be identified in the text but others are not and their meanings may not be consolidated but their common sound patterns are pointed out.""\n""Spelling is important to the programme and spelling progress is monitored.

The reading ages of the pupils are determined by an in-house test of single word reading. The exact entry lesson is tailored for a particular group of pupils because groupings and starting points will vary according to the needs of the pupils within a particular school. At the end of the Butterfly Book, a consolidation test checks that the pupils are sufficiently skilled to take on the demands of the Advanced Butterfly Reader. In the study, all the pupils except two remained in the class in which they started, and progressed through the books together; two pupils began in Butterfly Class 2 and found the work very easy so were moved up to Class 3. Each lesson covered one chapter as the programme is class-orientated and didactic.

It is also available from retail book websites. The Butterfly Grammar Book costs £9.50, has the same publisher, and is available from the same outlets. During the intervention, it was used only occasionally, when grammatical weaknesses were identified. The Advanced Butterfly Reader and Junior Butterfly Reader cost the project £10.00 each. They are printed by Printmeit but have not yet been published. It is possible to pre-order printed versions of them through Real Action. The Advanced Butterfly Reader was used in this trial because it was most suited to the age group being studied. Each pupil was provided with an exercise book and a pencil by the Real Action project. The project therefore cost nothing for the schools to be involved in, apart from staff liaison time with the project, providing lists, and setting up the computer tests. Schools varied greatly in how much teacher time they were prepared to give the project in a supporting role, helping with discipline problems if necessary, and ensuring pupils’ attendance at intervention lessons and test administration sessions. Training The Butterfly practitioners who taught the intervention were postgraduate students recruited from London University colleges, as described earlier, as well as local people with experience of working with pupils, some of whom were qualified teachers. Initial training was delivered by the Education Director of Real Action and the Project Manager for Butterfly Phonics. The practitioners were then required to observe classes at the Butterfly Saturday Reading School which is the project’s model school and works as their training centre. Once complete, they received specialist training by Irina Tyk, the author of the Butterfly Book. When they started teaching the intervention, the practitioners were observed regularly by the Education Director and the Project Manager and given feedback during monthly teacher meetings. These teacher meetings also functioned as mini training sessions and were an opportunity for teachers to share experiences. Butterfly practitioners were paid £20 per hour. All Butterfly classes are delivered to pupils by two adults: either one teacher (at £20.00 per hour) with one teaching assistant (at £15.00 per hour) or two teachers (each at £20.00 per hour). Therefore the cost of the Butterfly teaching staff for a one-hour class was £35 or £40. The specialist training from Irina Tyk cost £600 for half a day. Assuming eight pupils in a class, the following costs have been estimated (fewer or more pupils in a class will alter these figures). The cost per pupil is calculated as £21 for course books and stationery, and £87.50 for the teaching of 20 hours of the intervention (20 hours is the average number of hours that a pupil in Phases One and Two received the intervention). The £87.50 is based on the £35 an hour cost for the project of a Butterfly practitioner and a Butterfly teaching assistant. The overall estimated cost per child in these circumstances is therefore £108.50, based on information provided by the project.[¬e]""', 'Page 26:\n[¬s]""If an experienced teacher employed by a school were to teach alongside a teaching assistant, the teaching cost would be higher by about £10 an hour per lesson, increasing this estimated teacher cost to approximately £112.50 for a 20-hour course of instruction, and the overall cost rises to £133.50 per child. The Butterfly practitioners undergo extensive training, which includes periods of observing experienced practitioners as well as specialist training. It is possible that experienced teachers may not require such intensive training but they would need some training in the Butterfly method. It is not known what form such training would take once it was rolled out nationally, but training courses and instructional videos are likely to be involved. An amount to cover these contingencies would have to be factored in to the costs for a school. In conclusion, if pupils were to be taught in groups of eight by fully trained Butterfly practitioners, the estimated cost is £108.50 per pupil; if taught by experienced school teachers with teaching assistants, the estimated cost is £133.50, not including specialist training in the Butterfly method.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['An organization commissioned independently to evaluate', 'Is this an EEF evaluation?']",NA,NA,,Yes,,['Yes'],"['Page 19:\n[¬s]"" EAL is disproportionate between the intervention and control groups with 65% (28) of pupils with a different language as their first language in the control group.""\n""Other factors except SEN are also comparable between the experimental groups.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Unclear or details not provided'],NA,NA,,['Yes'],"['Page 19:\n[¬s]""Table 6: Baseline characteristics of the pupils in the study""\n""Table 7: Baseline characteristics of the pupils in the study[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Educational attainment', 'Gender', 'Socio-economic status', 'Special educational needs', 'Other (please specify)']","['Page 19:\n[¬s]""NGRT""\n""SWRT""\n""PhAB[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""Gender[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""FSM[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""SEN[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""EAL""\n""Pupil Premium""\n""Ethnicity[¬e]""']","Pupil Premium, EAL, Ethnicity",,['Yes'],"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""The data were analysed using multilevel modelling to account for the clustering of pupils within schools.[¬e]""']",NA,
