This eligible pupil did not take the post-test. In addition, it was not possible to collect post-test data for 96 intervention pupils and 72 control pupils. They were either absent on the day of the testing (n=93), or had left the school (n=44), or were present but did not take the test (n=29), or parents had withdrawn their participation from the trial (n=2). These pupils were from a number of intervention and control schools where other pupils took the post-test. Please refer to the ‘follow-up’ section of Figure 2. Finally, there were some pupils for whom we had post-test data but no prior attainment data. We excluded these from the primary analysis. Therefore, overall, the primary analysis involved 501 pupils from 69 intervention schools and 505 pupils from 72 control schools. On average, there were seven pupils per school, with some schools with two pupils and other schools with twelve pupils.
