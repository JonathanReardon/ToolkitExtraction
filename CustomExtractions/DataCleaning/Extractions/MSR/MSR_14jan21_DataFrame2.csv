Introduction: In this step, the students are provided a purpose for the ensuing lesson, and they are told why the acquisition of the skill will help them become better readers. In effect, the introduction is simply a structured overview, so the students have a clear understanding of the content and purpose of the lesson that follows. 2. Example: As an extension of the introduction, a section of text that contains an example of the skill is shown to the students. This helps the students understand more fully what they will learn about. The example demonstrates how this relationship or convention exists in written text (main ideas in this example) and how the ability to understand the relationship or convention will help students better comprehend what they read. 3. Direct instruction: Direct instruction, the real heart of the instructional strategy, consists of the teacher telling, showing, demonstrating, modeling the skill to be learned. In direct instruction, the teacher is leading the lesson; that is, responsibility for skill acquisition rests solely with the teacher. Students should be involved with learning, but the transfer of responsibility to students comes in following steps. Heuristics are also an important part of direct instruction; they provide students with some structure or method to use when they apply independently the skill in the future. 4. Teacher-directed application: In this step, the responsibility for skill acquisition begins to shift to the student. In teacher-[¬e]""', 'Page 8:\n[¬s]""directed application, the teacher still initiates the activities, but the student is required to “puzzle out” texts which contain the targeted skill. In other words, the teacher is still present for guidance and feedback, but the students are forced to apply the skill previously taught. This enables the teacher to monitor the students’ success in skill acquisition and then reteach the skill if necessary. 5. Independent practice: In the final step, the transition from full teacher responsi\xad bility for learning, to shared pupil/teacher responsibility, to full student responsibility is complete. Students are provided exercises that consist of materials not used in instruction or application and which require them to practice the skill independently.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""In light of the success researchers have had in training students in comprehension skills when instruction has been systematic and direct, it was the purpose of this study to develop a direct instruction paradigm for teaching children main idea comprehension and to evaluate its effectiveness relative to traditional (basal reader) instruction in main ideas and to no instruction at all.[¬e]""']",NA,,['University/ researcher design'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,['Students'],NA,NA,,['Large group/class teaching (+6)'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,['During regular school hours '],NA,NA,,['Research staff'],NA,NA,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" over a 2 1/2 week period[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" received eight lessons""\n"" distributed over a 2 1/2 week period[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""lessons of 30 minutes each[¬e]""']",NA,,['No implementation details provided.'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,['The developer'],NA,NA,,No,,['No/Unclear'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,

Each student keeps a concept journal in which he/ she records her ideas and the condition of her ideas. To avoid concern that students might use the condition terms, such as fruitful, without reliably understanding what it means for a concept to be fruitful, students considered the condition of their ideas by asking them- selves a series of questions developed by Hennessey (1991, 1993). To illustrate, when considering whether a science idea is intelligible, the student should be able to give examples of the concept or be able to explain his or her idea to a classmate (Fig. 4). For an idea to be plausible, the student must decide if his or her idea ﬁts with other experiences that they have had or know about. If the idea is fruitful, the student considers whether his or her idea helps in problem solving or explains phenomena in a new and/or better way. The aim in the concept exploration phase is to give students the opportunity[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""to explore phenomena related to the concept under investigation. During the concept in- troduction phase, the teacher collects information the students have generated and works with students to deﬁne patterns in the data and introduce the main concept of the lesson.

In the concept appli- cation phase, students are confronted with other examples of the science concept that can be understood using information produced during the earlier phases and again consider the condition of their science ideas.

The facilita\xad tor explicitly taught and demonstrated how the strategies were used with the aid of the appropriate self-instructions techniques. The self-instructions included the combination of problem definition, planning, strategy use, self-evaluation, coping and error cor\xad rection, and self-reinforcement statements. Collaborative and independent practice of the students were used to monitor the efficient use of the self-regulated learning strategies. The first five sessions oriented the stu\xad dents to the value of personal responsibility, self-efficacy, learning goal and attribution to effort. The facilitator delivered lectures with the aid of story telling, picture presentations and group sharing of ideas. Participants were asked to share their goals and ambitions in life through the lessons discussed. Sessions six to eleven were conducted to formally introduce Zimmerman’s (1989) 14 self-regulated learning strategies. Each strategy was explained emphasizing its use and importance to learning. Participants were given opportunities to practice each strategy on their own. They were explicitly taught how to write learning goals as well as how to properly pace, sequence and plan activities. The facilitator demonstrated the think-aloud strategy for rehearsing and memorizing information and then asked volunteers to do same. The students collated records of quizzes, seat works and assignments to monitor their performance and progress in schoolwork.

The facilitator guided the students for the self-consequating to be fair and to call for and reward accomplishment rather than simply obedience. As for the last strategy, students were encouraged to seek assistance from their peers, parents, teachers, and tutors as well as to use the school library to seek additional information. Sessions 12-30 were facilitated for the participants to apply the self-regulated learning strategies in their Mathematics lessons. During the remaining sessions, students were guided to monitor and evalu\xad ate their own progress with the proper use of self-regulated learning strategies.

Additional activities had the students speculate as to how the interviewee on the radio broadcast discussed earlier might react to the way the housing problem was described in the comic book, and as to how landlords, developers, renters, and buyers would have been represented had the comic book been prepared by realtors. Finally, the students were required to evaluate the comic book and decide whether it presented an accurate assessment of the housing problem and to provide evidence to support their opinion.

The first session was a practice session to familiarize the subjects with the research situation, procedures, and the researcher. Based on recommendations of Collins and Smith (1980), the first session consisted of teacher cognitive modeling to a group of twelve, followed by each subject practicing the modeled techniques while reading aloud to another subject, concluding with each subject using the techniques and thinking aloud while reading silently. The second and third sessions consisted of teacher cognitive modeling to groups of two, followed by each subject individually using the modeled strategy and thinking aloud while reading silently, followed by a buffer task, an oral retelling of the passage read, and written comprehension ques t i o n s . [¬e]""', 'Page 109:\n[¬s]"" Specific Procedures At the beginning of the first session the subjects were told that the purpose of the study was to try out some methods that teachers can use to help their students comprehend better when they read, that it would not be used 93[¬e]""', 'Page 110:\n[¬s]""as a test of their individual abilities (Olshavsky, 1976-77; Pritchard, 1987) and that it would not affect their class grade in any way. The session began with a short discussion of thinking silently as opposed to thinking aloud, things that are confusing as one reads, and what a reader can do to fix-up the confusions. The following directions adapted from those used by Bereiter and Bird (1985, p . 145), were typed and given to the subjects to read silently as the researcher read them orally: 1. I will be showing you some ways to read that will help you better understand what you read. I will read some passages out loud, saying my thoughts out loud as I go along. I will say what is confusing for me while I read and what I can do to fix it up. You will follow on your copy. Pay attention to the types of things I think and say while I\'m reading. 2. You will then be given a passage to read. You will read it orally with a partner and apply the same think aloud strategy I used when I read for you. As you read, stop frequently and tell your partner when something is confusing and then tell your partner what you will do to fix it up. Wherever you see a red dot on the paper, I want you to stop and tell what you\'re thinking. You can stopother places, too, but always stop where there\'s a red dot. 3. After you have finished the reading, fill in the signposts check sheet. 4. You and your partner will tape record each other. These directions were also reviewed at the beginning of the second and third sessions with minor changes given in directions 2 and 3 - namely ""read it silently"" and, ""tell me everything you can remember about what you read"" and ""answer 94[¬e]""', 'Page 111:\n[¬s]""some written question"" after haviii3 read the passage. (See Appendix O . ) The cognitive modeling for all three sessions included two aspects of reading comprehension monitoring (problem identification and fix-up strategies) and utilized four of the steps from D a v e y 1s (1983) ""Think Aloud"" strategy: 1) make a prediction, 2) share an analogy, 3) verbalize confusions, and 4) demonstrate fix-up strategies that could be used to help clear up the confusion. The fix-up strategies followed those identified by Alessi, Anderson and Goetz (1979): 1) store the problem in memory as a pending question; 2) reread the text; 3) read ahead in the text; 4) consult another source. A listing of think-aloud steps and fix-up strategies was typed and available for subjects to refer to. They were also posted in the room on large sheets of construction paper. Davey and Porter (1982) found that posting strategies aided students in monitoring their own comprehension. This listing of the think-aloud steps and fix-up strategies served as ""signposts"" for subjects to refer to as they proceeded through their own think-alouds. [¬e]""', 'Page 112:\n[¬s]""I. PASSIVE COGNITIVE MODELING GROUP Step 1 Cognitive Modeling: The researcher cognitively- modeled a passage for the subjects. This modeling followed the same think-aloud strategy used in session 1 with the same emphasis on problem identification and fix-up strategies. The think-aloud steps and fix-up strategies remained posted throughout the study. Step 2 Verbal Protocol: Next, following a procedure developed by Meichenbaum and Goodman (1971), each subject individually performed the modeled think-aloud strategy to him/herself while silently reading another passage with no help from the researcher. Following the think-aloud the subject received a list of the think-aloud steps and was asked to self-check this ""signpost"" listing to see if he/she performed the steps in the strategy. Step 3 Comprehension Assessment: Immediately following, the subject was asked to work on a personal interests questionnaire which served as a buffer task. Based on Kintsch\'s (1974) work on memory, the insertion of an ""unrelated buffer passage"" between reading and recalling helps to block short term memory and helps assure that propositional memory and not short term memory is being tested. The use of a questionnaire for this purpose has been used in other studies (Mandel and 96[¬e]""', 'Page 113:\n[¬s]""Johnson, 1984; Pritchard, 1987) and was therefore used in this study. (See Appendix P.) After several minutes, the subject was instructed to orally retell the passage that he/she just read with the instruction Tell me everything you can remember about the passage you just read. What you might want to do is pretend that I haven\'t read it and that you\'re going to tell me everything you can remember about it. After the subject completed the retelling, probes were used following the criteria established by Tierney, Bridge and Cera (1978-79, p. 546). * Questions will use only information already supplied by the subject in the retelling. * Questions will not be stated in a way that they might lead the subject beyond their own understandings. Probes should not ""[lead] the readers into insights which were not originally their o w n . "" (e.g. Student: ""Well, it was about manatees and where they lived, and what they eat, and how they eat."" Probe: ""Are there any other things it told about the manatees?"" Student: ""Ya, they eat under water, and they live near Florida in lagoons and stuff like that."" Probe: ""Is there anything else y o u ’d like to add?"" Student: ""No."") After completing the probed retelling, the subject was instructed on how to complete the sentence verification assessment and allowed time to do so. (See Appendix K . ) I I . ACTIVE COGNITIVE MODELING GROUP Step 1 Cognitive Modeling: In this group, the cognitive modeling was prefaced with a statement by the researcher to explain the functional value of the 97[¬e]""', 'Page 114:\n[¬s]""strategy to be modeled and to foster self-efficacy in the subject. Students who do best in reading do certain things while they read. Those who do best in reading recognize when they don\'t understand what they are reading and they know what to do to fix-up the problem.""

Self-Regulating Questions (SRQ) are vital to the learning process: a. SRQ determine how students activate, alter, and sustain their knowledge (Zimmerman & Martinez-Pons, 1986) and are part of a self- directed process through which learners transform their mental abilities into task-related academic skills (Zimmerman, 2001, p. 1); b. Self-regulated students are active participants in their own learning process, taking the initiative to acquire skills and knowledge instead of depending on external sources; c. Students who self-regulate learning are more aware of their mistakes and take steps to correct their deﬁciencies (Zimmerman, 2001, p. 1); d.

Where necessary, the teacher intervenes in the interaction process in order to assist students in putting the cognitive strategies into practice (practice and feedback). After the work in small heterogeneous groups and after a diagnostic test the outcomes are discussed in a whole class session. The students then work individually in small homogeneous groups of 4 students (temporary \'within class setting\', i.e., low-, medium-, and high- achieving groups). The group of low-achievers works as a remedial group under the direct guidance and supervision of the teacher. Meanwhile the medium-, and high-achieving students work on enrichment tasks at the appropriate level. In the next stage all students work individually in the context of their own level group, with the opportunity of helping each other. Here too if needed, the low-achievers receive adapted guidance from their teacher. At the end of the session the teacher winds the teaching learning cycle down with a recapitulation of the most important concepts, procedures and strategies.

Differ- ences in access to resources are primarily seen in terms of knowledge and strategies. Low-achieving students are not always able to use knowledge and problem-solving strategies (at the right moment). As a consequence of deficiencies in strategic and metacognitive knowledge, low-achievers are not always able to cope with the strategies used by high-achievers. On their part, high-achievers are not always able to explain their routinely used strategies. From the cognitive perspective the promotion of learning in co-operative groups can be realised by improvement of their strategies and metacognitive awareness.

The metacognitive training condi- tion is part of the IMPROVE project described earlier. As indicated, metacognitive training uses a series of three kinds of questions: a comprehension question (i.e., What is in the problem?), a compare question (i.e., How is this problem similar/differentfrom the previous problem?), and a strategy question (i.e., What strategies are appropriate for solving the problem?). The questions were constructed and arranged to follow the four-stage model of the problem-solving process: orientation and problem identification, organization, execu- tion, and evaluation (Garofalo & Lester, 1985; Polya, 1973; Schoenfeld, 1985). The questions were deliberately de- signed to help students to be aware of the problem-solving process and to monitor their progress.""\n""Comprehension questions oriented students to articulate the main ideas in the problem (e.g., \x93Describe the problem in your own words without referring to the numbers\x94), clas- sify the problem into an appropriate category (e.g., this is a . . . problem), and identify the given and the unknown.""\n""Strategic questions refer to strategies appropriate for solving the problem. Students were prompted to use a mod-[¬e]""', 'Page 6:\n[¬s]""ified version of\x91 the number-line strategy suggested by Lewis (1989). The modified strategy is based on a compar- ison of two lines, each representing one variable, and equal- izing their lengths by adding the needed amount to the shorter line. ""\n""Finally, connection questions refer to the similarities and differences between the problem at hand and the problems solved previously. Students had to discuss the mathematical structure of the problem and to distinguish between the mathematical model and the problem\x92s story. In doing so, students gradually learned to distinguish between the sur- face and the deep mathematical structure of the problem. Students learned to distinguish between consistent and inconsistent problems as well as between problems sharing the same story context but having different mathematical structures (Weaver & Kintsch, 1992). ""\n""The three metacognitive questions were used by the stu- dents when they worked in small heterogeneous groups and by the teachers when they introduced compare problems to the whole class. worked with the teams, and reviewed the materials. A series of individual hand-held strategy prompt cards was used by the students during the practice and sub- sequent lesson-discussion sessions to instigate their discus- sion. Each student took turns trying to solve a problem and explain his or her reasoning by answering the metacognitive questions printed on the cards. When all team members agreed upon the answer, another student tried to solve the problem in the same way.

The children employed the first two statements before reading, then evaluated their progress with the third and fourth statements after reading a few sentences and, finally, used the fifth statement after the entire passage was read. In addition to learning how to employ the self-verbalization strategy, children were also instructed on when and why it would be important to use a self-verbalization strategy during reading. Children learned to internalize the self-statements through a four-step fading procedure in which the experimenter first modeled the statements. Next, the student and experimenter used the self-statements together. Then, the student whispered the statements without the experimenter. Finally, the student covertly used the statements and read the passage. These four phases constituted one presentation of the instructional package with the same practice story used throughout the presentation. The same story was employed so that children could focus on learning the self-statements. Once the four phases were completed on the first practice story, the whole procedure was repeated on the second practice story. These exact procedures were followed for all three training sessions.

The ReflectED approach comprises the following: 1. Pupils receive a weekly ReflectED lesson from their teacher who follows a series of lesson plans. 2. At least once a week, pupils are expected to reflect individually on their learning in other lessons and record these reflections on the Evernote platform (accessible through any tablet, netbook, laptop or PC). The lesson plans include tasks for the week, to support pupils to practice their metacognitive skills throughout their normal lessons. 3. Children code their reflections to record their thoughts on a lesson and their performance. This enables them, and the teacher, to read previous reflections to inform future teaching and learning.""\n""There are a total of 28 lessons in the materials provided by Rosendale. These lessons teach children specific metacognitive strategies they can use to support their learning, and teach them to reflect on their learning. For example, in the first lesson children are encouraged to think about when they learned something new and are then taught to juggle or do origami, which is not a skill they have learned before. Throughout this lesson pupils are encouraged to talk about how instruction helps them to learn, about learning in stages and the importance of practice.""\n""Enabling children to reflect well takes time and is scaffolded using a number of tools. A colour-coded system is used for the children to quickly show how well they thought they had done in a particular task. Green, for example, is used by a child to show they have been successful at the task and blue if they believe they have mastered the topic. Yellow denotes they are struggling and red is used to show that they are \x91stuck\x92. A set of pictures showing different feelings, like happy faces or rain clouds, is also provided along with a range of emotion words for the children to express their feelings about the learning process. The colour code, pictures and words are displayed in the classroom for children to quickly refer to. In the early stages of the process children fill in paper-based templates, which are pasted into their workbooks. When children start using the Evernote software on the iPads to record their reflections, they can either take pictures of the paper-based templates, or take pictures of the images or words expressing emotion and add a typed comment. These comments can become very detailed. They can also add audio or video to record reflections. A series of key words (\x91tags\x92) are used to label the posts on Evernote so that they can be easily searched either by the children or the teacher. Children and teachers can use these tags to go back and review their progress and find areas that need more work.

Lipson. During these lessons children were stimu- lated to think about reading strategies by direct ques- tions and groupdiscussions. Our intention wasto make children reflect upon various goals of reading and the actions, they could take to reach them. Questions, di- alogues, analogies,-and modelingwere all used to stim- ulate awareness. Each lesson also included worksheets that required children to read high-interest material and to apply the instructed strategy. Discussion fol- lowed the worksheets and provided feedback about options for selecting and employing strategies. Throughout the lessons children were persuaded that these were necessary and self-controlled strategies for reading. The second vehicle of instruction was the bulletin board that accompanied each lesson. In order to make each lesson on reading concrete and easy to understand, we chose metaphors to represent each strategy or con- cept. These metaphors were illustrated graphically on large bulletin board displays and were included as themes within each lesson. For example, the lesson on task evaluation used the metaphor ""-Be a reading de- tective"" to examine clues to the passage topic, length, and difficulty. Strategies for monitoring comprehen- sion were made comprehensible to 7-8-year-olds by using analogies to traffic signs, such as ""Stop\x97say the meaning in your own words"" arid ""Dead end\x97go back and reread the parts you don\'t understand."" Each bulletin board colorfully illustrated the metaphor and included several focal questions that directed children to think about how, why, and when to apply the strat- egy.

The Reading Edge combines effective instructional practices, a coherent curriculum, and frequent informal assessment and feedback to students, with extensive professional development for teachers and instructional leaders. This enables middle school teachers to provide intensive reading instruction that emphasizes four key areas: metacognitive strategy use, cooperative learning, goal-setting and feedback, and classroom management. Since reading levels vary widely for this age group, students are assessed and grouped for instruction in classes at their instructional level. All reading classes meet during the same 60-minute period each day. Students are re-assessed quarterly to determine their current levels of performance. These assessment results allow teachers and students to monitor and discuss progress, and to move students immediately to a more challenging group. This structure allows for differentiated, targeted instruction, as well as rapid acceleration. It allows students who are struggling with decoding and phonics to work through well-structured texts with a high proportion of phonetically decodable words, while in other classes, students use novels or expository texts appro- priate to their reading level to improve fluency and comprehension. Students receive regular feedback on their work, and set and review personal goals. As soon as students are ready, they move to the next level. Extensive training and ongoing coaching support within collaborative learning communities enable teachers to implement this aspect of the program efficiently and with integrity. Every Reading Edge lesson follows a regular pattern, but the instruction itself varies according to the nature of the text and the challenges it presents. Program developers carefully choose readings that lead the students to relevant discoveries and practice opportunities. Combining explicit instruction in metacognitive reading strat- egies with peer collaboration and regular assessment and feedback builds studentsÕ confidence as they try out their new tactics. Although lessons vary significantly in level of difficulty and purpose, all follow this structure: setting the stage; active instruction; teamwork; and time for reflection. The four key areas of metacognitive strategy use, cooperative learning, goal setting and feedback, and classroom management are embedded in the everyday class- room routines that teachers use for instruction and that students use to become better readers (Slavin et al., 2005). The following sections describe how each of the key program areas is manifested in The Reading Edge.[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""16 R. Slavin et al. Cooperative learning in The Reading Edge Cooperative learning refers to a wide variety of methods in which students work in small groups (usually four members) to help one another learn. Extensive experimental research on cooperative learning methods has found that these strategies generally increase student achievement if they incorporate group goals and individual account- ability (Slavin, 1995; Slavin, Hurley, & Chamberlain, 2003; Webb & Palincsar, 1996). Cooperative learning has been particularly effective and extensively researched in middle schools (Roseth, Johnson, & Johnson, 2008; Slavin et al., 2003). Cooperative learning methods in which students have regular opportunities to discuss ideas with partners, to help each other study, and to provide formative feedback to each other have been successfully evaluated in several randomized evaluations in elementary and middle schools (Slavin, 1978, 1995; Slavin & Karweit, 1984). Cooperative learning has also been successfully evaluated many times as a means of introducing and practicing metacognitive skills. For example, Meloth and Deering (1992, 1994) found that peers could help each other acquire metacognitive strategies. Dansereau (1988) and OÕDonnell (1996) studied Ôcooperative scriptsÕ, in which students took turns summarizing and evaluating each otherÕs summaries. Fantuzzo, Polite, and Grayson (1990) developed and evaluated reciprocal peer tutoring strategies to help students study complex material. In The Reading Edge, students work in teacher-assigned cooperative teams of four or five students. Each student is individually accountable for his or her own learning and there are no group grades. However, teams are rewarded when all members improve their performance compared to their past performance. Students set goals together, and with the support of practiced routines, they help each other learn new content, use, evaluate, and personalize strategies, and remain attentive to the task at hand. Teams also provide a safe environment for individuals to try out new ideas or admit when they are confused. Each team works to help each member achieve his or her Ôpersonal bestÕ so there is always an equal opportunity for success Ð teams are not in competition with each other. Metacognition in The Reading Edge Numerous studies show that metacognition plays an important role in both learning to read and in learning new content through reading (Armbruster, Anderson, & Ostertag, 1987; Gertz, 1994; Langer & Neal, 1987). Research suggests that students who can assess their own knowledge and interest in a topic and choose and apply effective strategies to understand unfamiliar text on that topic can control their learning envi- ronment and successfully make meaning from what they read (Tei & Stewart, 1985). Metacognitive strategies are directly taught in specific Reading Edge lessons, and regular use of strategies is supported by the routines built into every lesson. Early in every Reading Edge lesson, students are presented with ÔThe big questionÕ, a provoc- ative question that students ponder and discuss over the course of the dayÕs activities. With stems such as ÔHave you everÉÕ or ÔHow would you handle this characterÕs challengeÉÕ or ÔBased on what you know aboutÉÕ, students must draw upon their own experiences and beliefs as well as details from the text they are reading in order to formulate their answer. This question often leads to student-generated questions of the same kind, and enriches team and partner discussions about the text. It also requires students to paraphrase or summarize what they have read, and encourages students to monitor their comprehension as they read.[¬e]""', 'Page 6:\n[¬s]""Effective Education 17 Also in the beginning of every lesson, teachers complete a ÔBuilding backgroundÕ segment in which they activate prior knowledge with ÔKWLÕ charts that ask students to summarize what they know about the topic (K), what they want to know (W), and then, at the end of the lesson, what they learned (L). Teachers make connections to student interests, and hold conversations in which they discuss vocabulary important to the understanding of the text. They preview the text and discuss text features that prompt students to make predictions about the main idea, topic, or theme, depending on the nature of the text. During the ÔActive instructionÕ portion of the lesson, the teacher engages students in targeted instruction on how to use a particular strategy or skill. For example, the teacher will read aloud a passage from the text and stop and Ôthink aloudÕ about some- thing significant, perhaps an example of foreshadowing, and how it influences her thinking as she reads. As she does this, she is breaking down a larger strategy into smaller steps so students can understand the otherwise invisible tools that good read- ers use. Now that this strategy has been modeled and discussed, students practice using it as they read, and later reflect upon whether or not it helped them. Teachers use techniques for keeping the lesson moving at a brisk pace by posing important questions to the entire class, allowing for team discussion, and randomly call- ing on students to answer as representatives of their teams. Students learn that any team member could be called upon to answer for their team, so they must help each other prepare to answer every question (Kagan, 2001). For quick checks for understanding, teachers use whole-class responses such as Ôthumbs-up/thumbs-downÕ to keep the pace of instruction brisk, and every child involved (Emmer, Evertson, & Worsham, 2003). During teamwork, students read some text silently and some aloud with a partner. They stop regularly to paraphrase what they just read, to share insights, and to clarify understanding. After reading, each team of four or five students uses another routine to discuss what they have read, and ÔDiscuss and defendÕ their answers to prepared ÔTeam talk questionsÕ. Students have the opportunity to clarify their thinking, try out new ideas, use new vocabulary, and help someone else understand the text, all in the safety of a small collaborative group. During teamwork time, the teacher circulates around the room to check for understanding, prompts and reinforces positive behavior, and conducts quick, informal conferences with partners or teams called ÔOne-to-onesÕ. During these interactions, the teacher can informally assess the studentsÕ grasp of the targeted strategy or skill. Goal-setting and feedback At the beginning of every cycle (six days of instruction ending with a curriculum-based assessment), students receive a Learning Guide. On it, students record reading goals for each lesson and points they earn for classwork, homework, and tests that make up their grade for the cycle. The Learning Guide is a self-assessment tool that helps the students identify strengths and weaknesses and set personal goals. It also helps students stay organized. Students keep track of their work as they complete it, and identify the work they still need to master. As the teacher visits each team during one-to-one confer- ences, she initials work that students have done well, and helps them identify next steps. Teams can earn bonus points for demonstrating extra effort by participating in activities such as ÔBook clubÕ, in which students share their critiques of books they have read outside of school. In ÔWord wiseÕ, students share how they have used their vocabulary words in new contexts. Students also learn to use a team mastery process[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""18 R. Slavin et al. to prepare for the end of cycle test. This gives students time to try out new study skills in a personally meaningful context. At the end of each cycle, students compare their current total score to their previ- ous work. Teams receive Ôimprovement pointsÕ for each member who increases his or her score, and the team is recognized in a whole-class celebration. This is also a time for the whole class to review their reading goals for the cycle and discuss which strat- egies worked well for them, which ones did not, and why. Every quarter, students take a standardized reading assessment. This information is added to the growing set of data about how students are performing. Students know that as soon as they show sufficient improvement in reading, they will move up to the next level, or even skip a level.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" students use to become better readers[¬e]""']",students to become better readers,,['University/ researcher design'],NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" Extensive training and ongoing coaching support within collaborative learning communities enable teachers to implement this aspect of the program efficiently and with integrity.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Students'],NA,NA,,"['Small group/intensive support (3-5)', 'Large group/class teaching (+6)']",NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,['During regular school hours '],NA,NA,,['Class teachers'],NA,NA,,NA,a year,,NA,daily,,NA,60 min,,['Qualitative'],"['Page 8:\n[¬s]"" Two-day observa- tions were conducted twice per year at each site, using a structured observation protocol based on the classroom assessment scoring system (CLASS) instrument (LaParo & Pianta, 2003)""\n"" For consistency, a single observer conducted all of the observations over two years.[¬e]""']",NA,,['No'],"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""In exchange for their participation, they received all Reading Edge materials and training at no cost""\n"" In the study years, control groups were provided with books or assessment materials related to programs they were already using.

Firstly, principles of motivational aspects of self-regulation (MSR) are introduced to the students. Secondly, reading strategies (Strat) as mentioned in the ÔOECMÕ-schema are taught and Þnally, a working-routine for cognitive self-regulation (CSR) is presented to the students. The instructional script and materials cover about 20 les- sons comprising of 45 min each. The program is based on a training developed by Schreblowski and Hasselhorn (2001) for small-group coaching in addition to classroom instruction.""\n"" during the Þrst four lessons, students were introduced to principles of goal-setting, self-assessment and causal attribution. By means of a game whereby students had to throw a ring, they were shown that e in contrast to the usual competition e one can Þnd out a realistic goal (with average difÞculty) for oneself, depending upon oneÕs own ability.""\n"" These motivational aspects of self- regulation are repeated when students are dealing with texts later in the program. Using a metaphor Þrst described by Paris et al. (1984; ÔÔbe a reading detectiveÕÕ), the next lesson deals with the analogy between a ÔÔreal detectiveÕÕ and a ÔÔtext-detectiveÕÕ. As a detectiveÕs professional characteristics include searching for information, systematically fol- lowing a clue, and carefully monitoring the investigations e procedures that are quite familiar to the students e similarities concerning the reading process are discussed explicitly.""\n""At the beginning of the core strategy program two cognitive strategies are introduced to the students. Thinking about the headline of a story leads to an activation of prior knowledge. Forming mental images while reading a text supports looking for details and reading slowly, which helps to elaborate the information of a text and to inte- grate it with prior knowledge and beliefs. Students are told that these elaborative strategies support deeper understand- ing of a text. In general, instructional methods such as modelling and informed teaching were suggested as well as high intensity of interaction amongst students.[¬e]""', 'Page 6:\n[¬s]""Organizational strategies that reduce the text and help keep information in the readerÕs mind are contents of the next lessons. With the help of a text containing enumerations and redundancies students learn to condense information and to differentiate between more or less important passages of the text. The Þrst strategy is to underline important infor- mation and the second strategy is to summarize important information in oneÕs own words. Additionally, there is also a metacognitive strategy to check if the main ideas can be recalled after summarizing a text. Again, there is a close connection between cognitive and metacognitive strategies. The metacognitive strategy proves if the use of the cog- nitive strategy, like summarizing, led to a satisfactory result.""\n""The aim of the last lessons is to join the seven strategies together in an integrated routine that students can rely on. To illustrate that strategies should be used in a ßexible way and with regard to a speciÞc task there are some exercises called ÔÔmeans and goalsÕÕ. Students are asked to decide which strategies are appropriate in order to achieve a certain goal. The last step in the text-detective program is a ÔÔreading planÕÕ that offers a structured schema for planning, mon- itoring and regulating the reading process. Questions about the task/goal (before reading), choice of strategies (during reading), and success/consequences (after reading) promote cognitive self-regulation. The program ends with a second ÔÔreading gameÕÕ where students have to apply the reading plan to a text without assistance.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""The main purpose of promoting motivational aspects was to support self-regulated learning e goal-setting, strategy use, and investment of effort. Beyond this function of supporting strategy instruction we predicted that students in experimental classes with the program including motivational aspects of self-regulation would show signiÞcantly higher gains on self-efÞcacy and learning-goal orientation than students in control classes. Introducing strategy instruction into the classroom should bring about long-term effects. If the implementation of a strategy program leads to instructional change and to main ideas being transferred to further lessons, students will be given many opportunities to practice and internalize self-regulated reading. This should result in increased strategy knowledge and reading comprehension even months after Þnishing the program. We predicted that students in all ex- perimental classes would show signiÞcantly higher gains on knowledge about reading strategies and a standardized reading comprehension test than the control children in a retention test.

A synthesis of the literature related to inquiry teaching identiÞed four common stages or practices including questioning, planning, analyzing, and interpreting (Ebe- nezer et al., 2011; Krajcik et al., 1998; White & Frederiksen, 1998). We incorporated these four stages into an inquiry-based online module that allows students to move forward and backward to double-check their thinking and solutions at different inquiry stages. We embedded 10 metacognitive prompts (MP) and 7 cognitive prompts (CP) into the online module to help the students develop their inquiry prac- tices and to address the complexity of online learning and individual learning obstacles. This online inquiry-learning module with questions regarding the learning tasks, prompts (CP and MP), and SeasonSim included three components: a training task (guiding students to become familiar with the interface of SeasonSim and the learning platform), a structured inquiry (prompting students regarding what to do in the inquiry process), and a guided inquiry (allowing students to plan their own[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""investigation for given research questions or situations within the constraints of the platform). In the training task, the students were required to describe the relationship between the sun Ð earth distance and solar radiation at different latitudes after the teacher showed them how to manipulate SeasonSim.

Metacognitive consciousness questions refer to knowledge about problem-solvers, about the goals of the assignment, and about problem- solving strategies. A question Ôabout the problem-solverÕ guides the students to describe the benefits they obtained from the learning group work and how it helped them to advance their inquiry solution. A question Ôabout the assignmentÕ guides the problem-solvers to describe the goals of the tasks. Finally, the students were asked to describe the strategies they implemented to solve the problem and the reasons for choosing those strategies. The executive questions train students in regulating, controlling, and criticiz- ing the cognitive processes and products. Corollary, executive questions include planning, monitoring, and evaluation questions. The planning questions guide the problem-solvers to describe their thoughts before they began solving the inquiry problem, and how they decided on the order of activities by which they used to solve the problem. The monitoring questions guide the solvers to describe when and how they assessed their activity throughout their solution process, which difficulties they encountered, and whether they obtained the most out of the solution. Evaluation question guide the problem-solvers to describe how and in what ways they improved their functioning during the inquiry prob- lem-solving process. Both sets of metacognitive questionsÑmetacognitive consciousness and executive questionsÑprompt students to reflect on their learning process. Students were told that asking and answering the metacognitive questions would help them to under- stand and remember the inquiry process.
