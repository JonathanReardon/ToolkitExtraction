38224168,Adey (1990),1990,"In an attempt to accelerate the development of formal operations in average young adolescents, intervention lessons relating to all formal schemata were designed in the context of school science courses. Over a period of two years, up to 30 intervention lessons were given by science teachers to their classes in eight schools. Boys who started the program aged 12+ showed a pre‐posttest effect size on Piagetian tests of 0.89 SD compared with control classes. In terms of British norms for the development of operational thinking this was a mean change from the 51st to the 74th percentile. Neither the middle school students nor the 12+ girls showed greater gain than the controls. Gains were shown by girls in one 11+ class and in the two 11+ laboratory classes. In the laboratory school students given intervention lessons by the researchers maintained their gains over controls in formal operations at a delayed posttest one year after cessation of the program. There was no effect on tests of science achievement during the intervention.

This paper reports a new application of the principle to 5‐ and 6‐year‐olds in a disadvantaged inner city area. Aims.To investigate the effect of a cognitive intervention programme on the cognitive development of children in Year 1 of primary schools. Sample.Approximately 300 children in 14 Year 1 classes in 10 schools for the experimental group and 170 children in 8 classes in 5 matched schools as controls. Method.Quasi‐experimental pre‐test post‐test with experimental and matched control groups. One of the pre‐ and post‐tests was intended to probe for transfer. Children in experimental classes experienced a set of 29 activities designed to promote cognitive conflict and encourage social construction and metacognition over one school year. Results.The experimental group overall made significantly greater gains in cognitive development over the period of the experiment than the controls, in both direct (effect size 0.47) and transfer (effect size 0.43) tests, although when genders were considered separately, experimental boys' greater gains than controls did not reach significance. There was no interaction with various social and linguistic variables.

Eighty-four Further Education college students underwent a 10-session teaching intervention which dovetailed with their Additional Assessment integrative project work. Students took part in peer-based exercises in which they learned to critique imaginary examples of project outlines and plans,followed by similar peer-based critiquing of each others' proposed projects. Analysis of the students' dialogues with each other indicated that they had learned the importance of justifying arguments, and content analysis of their written work indicated that they engaged in justification of their arguments to a significantly greater degree than control groups. Several key variables in the dialogues correlated positively with justification in the written work,suggesting that the dialogue had impacted on the written work.

Students were stratified by class and randomly assigned to one of three treatments including reading comprehension strategy instruction, reading comprehension strategy instruction with attribution retraining, or Read Naturally. Performance was assessed on reading comprehension, meta-comprehension strategy awareness, and attributional beliefs about reading. Teachers were randomly assigned to training condition and implemented 12 thirty minute lessons during self-contained English or accelerated reading classes. Strategy instruction consisted of instruction for the strategies  (a) setting a purpose, (b) previewing text structures, (c) activating background knowledge, (d) self-questioning, (e) summarizing, and (f) strategy monitoring. Attribution training consisted of instruction in the concepts  (a) identifying self-promoting (positive) and self-defeating (negative) beliefs, (b) using positive self-talk with simple and complex scenarios, and (c) using positive self-talk to promote persistence and flexible strategy use  in addition, teacher feedback was designed to promote explicit connections between strategy use and success or failure with comprehension. The Read Naturally condition consisted of instruction using either the traditional or computerized version of the program. Statistically significant findings were found for those students receiving reading comprehension strategy instruction and reading comprehension strategy instruction with attribution retraining over those in the Read Naturally condition on recall of main idea information. In addition, there were statistically significant findings for students who received reading comprehension strategy instruction over those in the Read Naturally condition. There were not, however statistically significant effects for students in the reading comprehension plus attribution training condition, although there was a descriptive advantage in the predicted direction. Students who received attribution retraining attributed success more to internal factors (such as effort and strategy use) and less to external factors (such as luck and assistance from a teacher).

Subjects were 80 students in a public school district's full-time self-contained program for academically gifted. A triangulation research strategy was utilized in which both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered and analyzed. In this posttest only control group design, subjects were randomly assigned to experimental (philosophy) and control (literature) groups at their schools for one hour per day of reading, discussion, and writing. The New Jersey Test of Reasoning Skills and the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Processes, two tests of critical thinking, comprised the quantitative data. Qualitative data included (1) audio recordings of group discussions  (2) student journal entries written during 10 minutes following each discussion session. Transcriptions of a sample of discussion sessions in the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh weeks were coded, and frequency counts were made of student responses in each category on the Critical Thinking in Class Discussions  Student Response Checklist. In the content analysis of student journals, patterns and themes emerged as similar ideas were clustered into categories. Philosophy subjects' scores were significantly higher $(p.<.05)$ than literature subjects' scores on the New Jersey Test but not on the Ross Test. The lack of significance on the Ross Test was considered in terms of a possible ceiling effect. Transcriptions of audio tapes of group discussions revealed a higher percentage of critical thinking responses in philosophy groups for the sampled sessions, with philosophy groups averaging over twice as many critical thinking responses as the literature groups. The percentage of student-to-student responses more than doubled from Week 2 (20%) to Week 11 (54%) for philosophy groups, while the percentage in literature groups remained below 15% for each sampled session. Percentage of teacher talk in philosophy groups was half that in literature groups by the end of the study.

38224285,Chen (2009),2009,"With the rapid development of Internet technologies, the conventional computer-assisted learning (CAL) is gradually moving toward to web-based learning. Additionally, instructors typically base their teaching methods to simultaneously interact with all learners in a class based on their professional disciplines in the traditional classroom learning. However, the requirements of individual learners are frequently ignored in the traditional classroom learning. Compared to the conventional classroom learning, individual learners are the focus in web-based learning environments and many web-based learning systems provide personalized learning mechanisms for individual learners. One key problem is that learners have to frequently interact with web-based learning systems even though they lack instructors to monitor their learning attitudes and behavior during learning processes. Hence, a learner’s ability to self-regulated learning is clearly an important factor affecting learning performance in a web-based learning environment. Self-regulated learning is a goal-oriented learning strategy that is very suited to self-managed learning to promote learning performance of individual learners in a web-based learning environment. However, how to assist learners in cultivating self-regulated learning abilities efficiently is an important research issue in the self-regulated learning field. This study presents a novel personalized e-learning system with self-regulated learning assisted mechanisms that help learners enhance their self-regulated learning abilities. The proposed self-regulated learning mechanisms assist learners in becoming lifelong learners who have autonomous self-regulated learning abilities. Additionally, four self-regulated learning types, based on a self-regulated learning competence index and self-regulated learning performance index, are also proposed.

Past studies confirmed that reading articles with annotated contents enable knowledge sharing and improve the reading comprehension of learners. However, the self-regulated learning (SRL) ability of individual learners when reading learning materials and contributing annotations becomes a key factor affecting reading performance. Thus, this work proposes a SRL mechanism combined with a digital reading annotation system (DRAS) to enhance Grade 7 students to generate rich and high-quality annotations for promoting English-language reading performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, this work adopts a quasi-experimental design to assess an experimental group and control group learners who respectively use the proposed DRAS with and without the SLR mechanisms when reading English-language texts online. Compared with the control group learners, experimental results demonstrate that the reading comprehension and reading annotation abilities of the experimental group learners were significantly improved. Analytical results also confirm that gender differences in reading comprehension and annotation ability existed when using the proposed DRAS with and without the SRL mechanisms to read English-language texts online. Experimental results also show that significant differences existed in the reading comprehension and annotation abilities of learners with good and poor SRL abilities in the experimental group.

38224286,Chen (2014),2014,"Due to the rapid development of information technology, web‐based learning has become a dominant trend. That is, learners can often learn anytime and anywhere without being restricted by time and space. Autonomic learning primarily occurs in web‐based learning environments, and self‐regulated learning (SRL) is key to autonomic learning performance. Moreover, sustained attention to web‐based learning activities can be challenging for students. Therefore, a web‐based reading annotation system with an attention‐based self‐regulated learning mechanism (ASRLM), which is based on brainwave detection, is designed to enhance the sustained attention of learners while reading annotated English texts online, and thereby promote online reading performance. In total, 126 Grade 7 students in four classes at a junior high school in New Taipei City, Taiwan, are the participants. Among the four classes, two classes are randomly distributed to the experimental group and the other two classes are randomly distributed to the control group. The experimental group utilizes the ASRLM to support their reading of annotated English texts online, whereas the control group is not supported by the ASRLM while reading annotated English texts online. Experimental results show that sustained attention and reading comprehension of the experimental group are better than those of the control group. Moreover, the web‐based reading system with ASRLM support promotes the sustained attention and reading comprehension of female learners more than those of male learners while reading annotated English texts online. Additionally, learners with high‐SRL ability in the experimental group have better sustained attention and reading comprehension than those learners with low‐SRL ability.

The increases in field independence and formal operations were further developed by strategies that increased children's metacognition of the processes invoked.

38296678,Crawford (2014),2014,"The Literacy Intervention Toolkit (LIT) programme aims to improve the reading ability of children in Year 7 who scored below Level 4 at the end of primary school using a method known as reciprocal teaching. Reciprocal teaching methods encourage children to ‘become the teacher’. They are taught how to apply four comprehension strategies  summarising, clarifying, questioning, and predicting. These strategies enable children to check that they understand the content of the material they are reading and can make inferences based on what they have read. The LIT programme is tightly structured, providing training to staff as well as a set of detailed lesson plans on the use of reciprocal teaching to deliver basic instruction in literacy. However, the method of delivery is not particularly prescriptive. It can be used to teach whole classes or small groups, can be delivered by teachers or teaching assistants, and can be offered in addition to or instead of regular English classes. In this evaluation, children typically received 3–4 hours of LIT tuition per week for eight months, mostly delivered in small groups. The programme was devised by the Hackney Learning Trust, who delivered the training sessions for staff and developed a detailed set of lesson plans for them to follow. The primary outcome was reading ability as assessed by scores on the Access Reading Test (ART).

However, despite evidence suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach, little is known about how teachers most effectively model these processes and how students are influenced by modeled strategies. A Social Cognitive Theory of Learning was used as a theoretical basis for this investigation which was designed to address two major questions  (1) What are the relative merits of characteristics of general modeling when applied to cognitive modeling of reading comprehension processes? (2) How do the characteristics of modeling, when applied to cognitive modeling of reading processes, influence the comprehension and comprehension monitoring of eighth grade readers? One hundred average eighth grade readers were randomly assigned to one of four modeling conditions  (1) Passive Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling only. (2) Active Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling with statements to explain the functional value of the modeled strategy and to foster self-efficacy in the students. (3) Full range Cognitive Modeling. Modeling same as ""active"" group with feedback, (4) Control. No modeling. Students met with the researcher in small groups for three sessions. Each session consisted of the researcher's verbal cognitive modeling of a passage being read, followed by the students individually applying the modeled strategy to another passage, followed by an oral retelling of the passage and comprehension questions. Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance for oral retelling scores and for comprehension question scores, and with a chi-square for strategy use.

The three intervention methods employed in the study were Metacognitive Strategy Training, Attribution Retraining, and Combined Metacognitive Strategy Training and Attribution Retraining. In addition to the treatment groups, a control group of students with learning disabilities and an average reader control group were included. The intervention program took place over a three-week period, with two, 50-minute sessions per week. Learning disabled students in the Metacognitive Strategy Training group received instruction in five metacognitive reading strategies  purpose setting and previewing, using background knowledge and developing text-related questions, and summarization. Participants in the Attribution Retraining group were provided with instruction designed to help them adopt self-promoting beliefs regarding academic achievement. Students in the Combined group were exposed to a combination of the strategy training and attribution retraining used with the other treatment groups. Participants in the LD control group and the non-LD control group were given no training. Rather, they were asked to read one or two passages per session and respond to multiple-choice questions related to the passages. Participants' performance on a metacomprehension reading strategy inventory, an attribution rating scale, a reading comprehension quiz and a strategy use inventory was measured prior to the intervention (pretest), immediately following the intervention (posttest 1) and six weeks following the intervention (posttest 2). Data was analyzed using a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with IQ as a covariate. The results yielded significant time x group interaction effects on all variables, indicating that the method of intervention differentially effected subject response.

Four high‐school biology classes taught by this investigator were used to test the DIAL(SPS)2 curriculum. Scheduling of students involved ability grouping. To test the curriculum in the most rigorous way, the experimental group consisted of average ability students and the comparison group consisted of above‐average students.

Twenty-four students received instruction in reading strategies for use in three different stages of reading  Pre, during, and postreading. Pre-reading strategies included examining the title and headings, looking at the pictures, skimming the text, thinking about what the story might be about, and activating prior knowledge. The during reading strategies consisted of identifying the main idea, making inferences, and backtracking. Postreading strategies included self-monitoring such as ""Did I meet my goal?"", ""What did I learn?"", ""Were my predictions accurate?"", ""Did everything make sense?"", and ""Can I summarize the main points?"". In addition, the students received reattribution training for effort which made the students aware of the relationship between effort and achievement. The fifteen children in the control group received practice in reading for comprehension. Instruction for the control group centered on improving reading comprehension using a content based approach. Thus, while both the experimental and the control groups focused on reading comprehension, the experimental group utilized a skills-based approach while the control group employed a content-based approach.

These students wrote longer, more complete, and qualitatively better papers for both of these genres than peers in the comparison condition (Writers’ Workshop). These effects were maintained over time for story writing and generalized to a third uninstructed genre, informative writing. SRSD instruction boosted students’ knowledge about writing as well.

The purpose of this study was to systematically observe middle school tutors' use of reading strategies while tutoring primary students and compare the strategies that tutors, with and without metacognitive guidance, used. It was further designed to assess the impact that tutoring and knowledge about reading as a problem-solving activity had on 5th and 6th-grade tutors' strategy knowledge and use, reading comprehension, and attitude. Sixty-two elementary students participated over 11-weeks, 43 students as tutors and 19 as nontutors. To examine both tutoring and metacognitive effects, half of the tutors were guided in reading as a problem solving activity (+RPS tutors), while others tutored with no guidance (-RPS). A third group of students were guided in RPS but did not tutor (RPS only). It was hypothesized that +RPS tutors would make greater gains than -RPS tutors, and tutors would make greater gains than would nontutors. Students were pre- and posttested on experimental measures of reading strategy knowledge and use, reading comprehension, and attitude towards reading and tutoring. Thirty-three tutoring sessions were systematically observed during which the strategy use of seven +RPS tutors and eight -RPS tutors were recorded. Tutors were observed to implement an array of strategies. The two brief metacognitive sessions on thinking about reading as problem solving appeared to have an impact on students' tutoring  +RPS tutors used significantly more decoding strategies while tutoring than their -RPS counterparts. However, +RPS tutors did not, generally, maintain the greater strategy use when resolving problems to their own reading. One global reading strategy significantly differentiated the three conditions, and all tutors performed marginally better than nontutors on a measure of reading comprehension. Overall, attitude towards reading scores decreased significantly over time and across conditions.

Significant differences were found for time-of-test for both groups on text lookbacks and important information units recalled. There was no difference between the two groups on the text lookback variable. A nonsignificant correlation was found for the number of monitoring strategies used and the number of important information units recalled.

Teachers are trained in a repertoire of strategies that aim to encourage pupils to use higher order thinking skills. For example, pupils are posed ‘Big Questions’, such as ‘How do you know that the earth is a sphere?’ that are used to stimulate discussion about scientific topics and the principles of scientific enquiry. Two teachers from each participating school received five days of professional development training delivered by a team from Science Oxford and Oxford Brookes University. The training did not aim to provide participating teachers with a set of ‘off-the-shelf’ lesson plans to be delivered in schools  rather, it sought to support teachers to be more creative and thoughtful in planning their science lessons. In addition, teachers had dedicated time to work with colleagues to plan and review lessons taught as part of the project. Teachers were also encouraged to link pupils’ learning in science, with their learning in numeracy and literacy. This project sought to assess the impact of the programme on the academic outcomes and attitudes towards science of Year 5 pupils. 655 pupils from 21 schools across England completed the project. Participating schools followed the programme for the entirety of the 2013/14 academic year. A further 20 schools formed a randomised comparison group and did not receive training in the approach until the following year.","['Oral language interventions', 'Metacognition and self-regulation']",NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10']",NA,NA,,21,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""21 intervention schools[¬e]""']",,21,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""21 control schools[¬e]""']",,42,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" Forty-two primary schools were recruited[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 9:\n[¬s]""The evaluators matched schools into pairs based on pre-test results, pupils eligible for free school meals, pupils with English as an additional language, and the size of the school.

In this trial, Let’s Think Forum provided one day of training and three support sessions per year to the science teachers who would be teaching LTSS. These teachers then delivered the lessons to a cohort of Year 7 students instead of their usual science lessons. LTSS was delivered over two years, so this cohort of pupils continued to receive the programme in Year 8. LTSS was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial with over 8000 students in 53 schools.

One method focused on a prereading strategy in which children utilized previous experiences to predict events in the upcoming story. The second method provided practice in answering questions which required inferences between text and prior knowledge. The instruction was applied to ten basal-reader stories. Four dependent measures compared the comprehension ability of the two experimental groups and a control group. On comprehension questions following the instructional stories, the performance of the children in both experimental groups surpassed that of the control children. Standardized test scores and scores on an experimenter-designed test tended to favor the experimental groups, especially the group receiving practice in answering questions.

40307304,Hedin (2008),2008,"This dissertation consisted of two studies intended to (a) describe the monitoring behavior of readers with poor comprehension, and (b) determine whether an intervention featuring thinking aloud would positively impact their monitoring, strategy use, and comprehension. In Study 1, 116 sixth graders completed researcher-developed measures of comprehension and monitoring, and a self-report inventory of frequency of strategy use. Results indicated a significant correlation between error detection, used as a measure of monitoring behavior, and reading comprehension scores. Self-reports of strategy use were not correlated with any other measures. In Study 2, 63 sixth graders participated in one of three groups  control, question-response (QR), or thinking aloud (TA). They completed 15 lessons during which students in the experimental conditions read science passages with embedded errors intended to trigger monitoring and strategy use. Instructors used participant verbalizations to focus instruction on areas of concern using contingent support. Pre- and post-test measures included the Gates-MacGinitie, and all Study 1 measures. Whereas quantitative results indicated that the QR intervention had more positive impact on reading comprehension, thinking aloud did allow instructors to observe the existing strategy use and background knowledge of participants. Sixth graders failed to notice their comprehension breakdowns, a step that must precede repair activities. Thinking aloud instruction did allow an opportunity for instructors to promote monitoring  however, its impact did not transfer to post-test measures.","['Reading comprehension strategies', 'Metacognition and self-regulation']",NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,junior high school,,High ecological validity,NA,Delivered by five extra RAs as part of their studies but in a school context,,"['11', '12']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""Griffin Junior High[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""Griffin Junior High[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""Griffin Junior High[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],NA,We report study 2 which has 3 arms  thinking aloud (TA) question-response (QR)  control (general science instruction),,Random (please specify),"['Page 15:\n[¬s]"" Sixth graders were stratified by ISAT scores and then randomly assigned to a control or one of two intervention conditions : thinking aloud (TA), or question-response instruction (QR) groups.[¬e]""']",6th graders were stratified by ISAT scores and randomly assigned to one of the three conditions,,Individual,NA,NA,,['Individual RCT'],NA,NA,,Yes,"['Page 15:\n[¬s]""Sixth graders were\nstratified by ISAT scores and then randomly assigned to a control or one of two\nintervention conditions: thinking aloud (TA), or question-response instruction (QR)\ngroups[¬e]""']",NA,

The focus on differential effects is derived from studies into learning in small co‐operative groups, and from the results of meta‐analyses into the effects of training in learning strategies. From these studies it can be concluded that in general such programs contribute to learning. However, it seems that low‐achieving students are unable to benefit from interventions of the kind investigated (i.e., co‐operative learning and training in learning strategies).

An intervention stressing the metacognitive, regulatory, and strategic aspects of knowledge co‐construction, called Thinking Aloud Together, was embedded within a 12‐week science unit on building mental models of the nature of matter. Four classes of eighth graders received the intervention, and four served as control groups for quantitative analyses. In addition, the interactions of 24 students in eight focal groups were profiled qualitatively, and 12 of those students were interviewed twice. Students who received the intervention gained in metacognitive knowledge about collaborative reasoning and ability to articulate their collaborative reasoning processes in comparison to students in control classrooms, as hypothesized. However, the treatment and control students did not differ either in their abilities to apply their conceptual knowledge or in their on‐line collaborative reasoning behaviors in ways that were attributable to the intervention.

Findings revealed that students in both treatment classes improved their calibration accuracy and showed higher confidence on test performance than students in two comparison classes (N = 47, N = 26) after 2 weeks of instruction. However, students in the monitoring accuracy training class also showed significant gains in overconfidence in comparison to those in the other three classes.

Eight physics classes, with a total of 145 students, were randomly assigned to either a treatment or comparison group. The four treatment classes were taught how to use an explicit problem‐solving strategy, while the four comparison classes were taught how to use a textbook problem‐solving strategy. Students' problem‐solving performance and conceptual understanding were assessed both before and after instruction. The results indicated that the explicit strategy improved the quality and completeness of students' physics representations more than the textbook strategy, but there was no difference between the two strategies on match of equations with representations, organization, or mathematical execution. In terms of conceptual understanding, there was no overall difference between the two groups  however, there was a significant interaction between the sex of the students and group.

Teachers are trained to develop and teach challenging, enquiry-based science lessons that incorporate more practical activities, deeper thinking and discussion, and sharply focused recording. Following promising results from an efficacy trial of TDTS (Hanley et al., 2015), this effectiveness trial was commissioned to test its impact when implemented at scale. In this trial, science teachers received the training on four days spread across the school year, and the impact on the pupils in their science classes was measured at the end of the year. The model of TDTS tested here differs from the previous model in three key ways  the number of teacher training days was reduced from five to four  funding for two additional days of preparation per teacher (in the form of cover costs) was cut  and the programme also used a ‘train the trainer’ model in which CPD was led by pairs of experts who were trained in the TDTS model by the programme authors, rather than the authors training teachers directly (trainers were delivering the training to schools for the first time during the trial). The study used a two-arm cluster randomised controlled design  205 schools were randomised to either receive TDTS or to be part of a ‘business as usual’ waitlist control group  233 Year 5 teachers at 102 intervention schools received the training. The evaluation focused on the impact of TDTS on the educational attainment of pupils, as measured through a standardised science assessment. The study also used a survey to measure pupil interest in, and self-efficacy toward, science. The process evaluation assessed whether the train-the-trainer model was successful and explored the perceived value of the programme for teachers.

The children of 6 classes were trained to apply a strategy to reason inductively while the children of the remaining classes continued their regular classroom activities.

Results confirmed this expectation. Moreover, it was expected that training would improve performance on the inductive subtests of Cattell's Culture Fair Test 1, but not influence subtests that did not involve inductive reasoning.

38224181,Kramarski (1997),1997,"Background. The present study investigated the effects of metacognitive training implemented within a problem‐solving based Logo environment on students' ability to construct graphs and reflect on their learning. Aims. (1) To compare achievement outcomes of students who learned to construct graphs within a problem‐solving based Logo environment that was either embedded with or with no metacognitive training  and (2) To examine the differences in students' cognitive‐metacognitive behaviours under the different conditions. Samples. Participants were 68 students who studied in four computer classrooms. Methods. Intact classrooms were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups  one was exposed to a problem‐solving based Logo environment with metacognitive training (N=34) and the other to the same Logo environment with no metacognitive training (N=34). All students were examined at the beginning and at the end of the study on the Graph Construction Examination. In addition, at the end of the study students were interviewed to assess their cognitive‐metacognitive behaviours. Furthermore, to examine possible differences (if any exist) between the two conditions prior to the beginning of the study, students were administered the Raven Advanced Matrices Examination, and the Graph Interpretation Test. Results. Although no significant differences were found between groups prior to the beginning of the study on all pretreatment measures, at the end of the study the students who were exposed to the metacognitive treatment tended to construct graphs better than their counterparts who were not exposed to such treatment. The metacognitive group was also better able to reflect on their learning than their counterparts who were not exposed to such training. In addition, structured interviews indicated the positive effects of the metacognitive training on students' information processing, social‐cognitive interaction, and error detection. Conclusions. Being exposed to metacognitive training exerts positive effects on students' achievement outcomes and cognitive‐metacognitive behaviours.",['Metacognition and self-regulation'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['Israel'],,['Middle school'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" junior hig[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,"Whilst the usual teacher taught the students as part of the normal school routine, a researcher observed all sessions which may have reduced the ecological validity.",,"['12', '13', '14']","['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" Students\x92 ages ranged from 12 years 2 months to 14 years 4 months with an average of 13.3 years old.[¬e]""']",NA,,1,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Participants were 68 students (38 boys and 30 girls) who studied in one Israeli junior high school.[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Participants were 68 students (38 boys and 30 girls) who studied in one Israeli junior high school[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" one Israeli junior high school[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,2,"['Page 11:\n[¬s]"" two classes (N=34) learned Logo with metacognitive training[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 11:\n[¬s]""other two classes (N=34) learned Logo with no metacognitive training[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 1:\n[¬s]"" Intact classrooms were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups:[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]"" Students were randomly assigned to one of four computer classes.[¬e]""']",Students were randomly assigned to one of four computer classes.,,Class,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""Intact classrooms were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: one was exposed to a problem-solving based Logo environment with metacognitive training (N=34) and the other to the same Logo environment with no metacognitive training (N=34[¬e]""']",NA,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 11:\n[¬s]""After the pretesting, intact classes were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: two classes (N=34) learned Logo with metacognitive training and the other two classes (N=34) learned Logo with no metacognitive training[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]"" Students were randomly assigned to one of four computer classes.[¬e]""']",NA,,No/Unclear,NA,NA,

The purpose of the study was to test the theory that the use of computerized library research is a more effective methodology for teaching critical thinking skills than the traditional paper-based process. To test this theory a pretest/post test research design was employed. Evaluation of the results was done using a students t-test for independent groups. It was predicted that the the experimental group using computer assisted library research would show greater improvement in critical thinking skills than the control group using traditional library research methods. Method. Subjects were pre-existing groups of homogeneously grouped ninth grade social studies students. There were 204 students in the study, 93 students in the experimental group and 111 students in the control group. An analysis of the pretest data indicated no significant differences between the groups. Each group was given instruction in the use of their respective methodology. Equivalent assignments were made to each group participating in the study. Each group received a pretest and post test using the Cornell Critical Thinking Skill Test, Level X, third edition 1985. The data obtained was analyzed for changes in both overall critical thinking skills and in individual sub-areas of critical thinking skills. Results. The result of pretest/posttest analysis indicate that a significant increase occurred in the overall critical thinking skills of the experimental group, while a corresponding significant increase was not observed in the results of the control group (.05 level of significance). The result of the analysis of the individual subgroupings of critical thinking skills was inconclusive, possibly due to the inability of the research tool to discriminate these individual areas.

38223956,Lonberger (1989),1989,"Problem. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of training in a self-generated learning strategy on the prose processing abilities of fourth- and sixth-graders. The study also explored the extent to which grade level and passage difficulty interacted with training to produce treatment effects. Procedure. Seventy-two fourth- and sixth-grade students were randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition within grade levels. The experimental groups received ten hours of instruction in reader-generation of questions both (a) prior to and (b) during the reading of expository text. The control group received instruction in identifying the main idea of paragraphs. Instruction took place daily in thirty-minute sessions over a period of twenty days. Final evaluative testing included five criterion measures. A Metacomprehension Strategy Index was administered to determine if the reading strategy taught in the study was learned. A post-experimental interview was administered to gain insight concerning the processes students use, to understand prose. To assess comprehension, the experimenter devised a criterion assessment consisting of two six hundred word passages for each grade level. Each passage was followed by twelve questions that tapped the main ideas presented in the text. One passage represented an easy reading level, and one was difficult for the subjects involved. The Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test was used as a standardized measure of reading comprehension. Two confidence rating scales were obtained on all subjects, one based on each of the two criterion passages read. This measure served as an indicator of the subjects'' self-monitoring skills. The results of the study can be summarized as follows  (1) treatment did manipulate metacomprehension skills  (2) there were no significant interactions between grade level and treatment  (3) the difference in performance between experimental and control subjects was significant on the Criterion Reference test, but there were no statistically significant treatment effects on the Gates-MacGinitie or the Confidence Rating Scale  and (4) there were no interaction effects for treatment and passage difficulty at either the fourth- or the sixth-grade levels.",['Metacognition and self-regulation'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10', '11', '12']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 89:\n[¬s]""Subjects who were in fourth- and sixth-grades at Geneseo Elementary School[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 89:\n[¬s]""Subjects who were in fourth- and sixth-grades at Geneseo Elementary School[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 89:\n[¬s]""Subjects who were in fourth- and sixth-grades at Geneseo Elementary School[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,2,"['Page 92:\n[¬s]""Grade 4: Experimental""\n""Crado 6: Experimental[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 92:\n[¬s]""Grade 4« Control""\n""Grade 6: Control[¬e]""']",,4,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 87:\n[¬s]"" seventy-two subjects were randonly assigned to the treatment or control group within grade levels.[¬e]""', 'Page 90:\n[¬s]"" Students were randonly assigned to classes utilized in the study.

38224013,Mevarech (2003),2003,"Background  The present study is rooted in a cognitive‐metacognitive approach. The study examines two ways to structure group interaction  one is based on worked‐out examples (WE) and the other on metacognitive training (MT). Both methods were implemented in cooperative settings, and both guided students to focus on the problem's essential parts and on appropriate problem‐solving strategies. Aims  The aim of the present study is twofold  (a) to investigate the effects of metacognitive training versus worked‐out examples on students' mathematical reasoning and mathematical communication  and (b) to compare the long‐term effects of the two methods on students' mathematical achievement. Sample  The study was conducted in two academic years. Participants for the first year of the study were 122 eighth‐grade Israeli students who studied algebra in five heterogeneous classrooms with no tracking. In addition, problem‐solving behaviours of eight groups (N = 32) were videotaped and analysed. A year later, when these participants were ninth graders, they were re‐examined using the same test as the one administered in eighth grade. Method  Three measures were used to assess students' mathematical achievement  a pretest, an immediate post‐test, and a delayed post‐test. ANOVA was carried out on the post‐test scores with respect to the following criteria  verbal explanations, algebraic representations and algebraic solution. In addition, chi‐square and Mann‐Whitney procedures were used to analyse cooperative, cognitive, and metacognitive behaviours. Results  Within cooperative settings, students who were exposed to metacognitive training outperformed students who were exposed to worked‐out examples on both the immediate and delayed post‐tests. In particular, the differences between the two conditions were observed on students' ability to explain their mathematical reasoning during the discourse and in writing. Lower achievers gained more under the MT than under WE condition. Conclusions  The findings indicate that the kind of task and the way group interaction is structured are two important variables in implementing cooperative learning, each of which is likely to have different effects on mathematical communication and achievement outcomes.",['Metacognition and self-regulation'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['Israel'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['13', '14']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""According to school regulations, when students move from eighth to ninth grade, they\nare randomly reassigned to new classroom[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""In order to reduce\nbackground noise, each team was videotaped separately in a quiet room in the school.[¬e]""']",,NA,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""According to school regulations, when students move from eighth to ninth grade, they\nare randomly reassigned to new classrooms.[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""In order to reduce\nbackground noise, each team was videotaped separately in a quiet room in the school[¬e]""']",,NA,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""According to school regulations, when students move from eighth to ninth grade, they\nare randomly reassigned to new classrooms[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""In order to reduce\nbackground noise, each team was videotaped separately in a quiet room in the school.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,unclear,NA,,unclear,NA,,NA,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""who\nstudied mathematics in five heterogeneous classrooms with no trackings or groupings.\nStudents were randomly assigned into mathematics classrooms by school authorities\nindependent of the present study, and intact classrooms were randomly assigned int[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" intact classrooms were randomly assigned into treatment, either WE (/V = 52) or MT (/V = 70) conditions.[¬e]""']",NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" randomly assigned into treatment,[¬e]""']",NA,,Class,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" intact classrooms were randomly assigned into treatment, either WE (/V = 52) or MT (/V = 70) conditions.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Cluster RCT'],"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""intact classrooms were randomly assigned into\ntreatment, either WE (/V = 52) or MT (/V = 70) conditions.[¬e]""']",NA,,No/Unclear,NA,NA,

We analyzed the effects of dynamic scaffolding on dyads’ performance, their perception of the learning environment and students' knowledge acquisition. We found that scaffolding had a positive effect on the dyads’ learning performance, but did not affect students’ domain knowledge. The repeated measurements of perception of the learning environment showed that dyads in the experimental condition were more positive about their teachers and their collaborators than students in the control condition.

38296654,Motteram (2016),2016,"The ReflectED programme was developed by Rosendale Primary School to improve pupils’ metacognition—their ability to think about and manage their own learning. This includes the skills of setting and monitoring goals, assessing progress, and identifying personal strengths and challenges. ReflectED consists of 28, weekly, half-hour lessons, which teach pupils strategies they can use to monitor and manage their own learning. Pupils are supported to apply and practise these strategies throughout the rest of the curriculum  reflect on their learning  and record audio, photographed and written notes of their reflections on Evernote, a note-taking app. Pupils are then encouraged to review and reflect on these records over time, so that they can observe their progress and consider which strategies seemed to work well. Teachers can also look across these records to get an overview of the areas that pupils are enjoying or struggling with, and identify specific pupil needs. For example, a teacher could explore the notes that a pupil has tagged as “maths” and “difficult” to see which ones they struggled with, and examine which strategies seemed to help them with this. In this project, Rosendale Primary School trained teachers from 30 schools in five areas throughout England to deliver ReflectED over the academic year 2014/15. At the beginning of the year, participating teachers received a pack of lesson plans and supporting resources, and an initial day- long training session. This was followed by three additional half-day training sessions throughout the year. A website, digital resources, and weekly reminders and tips were provided by the London Connected Learning Centre. The National Education Trust supported school recruitment and test administration. The programme was co-funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), KPMG Foundation and Nominet Trust, and was part of a funding round focused on digital technology. The impact of the programme on the attainment of pupils in Year 5 was evaluated using a randomised control trial involving 1858 pupils. Year 5 teachers within each of the 30 schools were randomly allocated to either participate in the programme or to a control group which continued with their usual teaching. The primary outcome measure was pupils’ maths attainment. The evaluation also examined the impact on pupil’s reading attainment and attitudes towards reading and maths, and the impact on the maths attainment of pupils eligible for free school meals. Class observations, interviews and focus groups were conducted to examine how the programme was implemented and adapted by teachers, explore activity in the control group, and identify factors that might affect the impact of the programme.

Thirty-nine students from two fifth grade classes participated in the study. Twenty students in the experimental group received district curriculum reading instruction using metacognitive strategy instruction they were taught the purpose and value of using four metacognitive strategies  (1) think-aloud, (2) text connections, (3) visualization, and (4) questioning. Nineteen students in the control group received district curriculum reading instruction without metacognitive strategy instruction. These two fifth grade classes did not have significant differences on pre-test measures of formal or informal reading assessments. After a 15-week treatment period, posttest scores were indicative of significant differences between the experimental and control group that could be ascribed to metacognitive strategy instruction. Ten students from each group were interviewed assessing this metacognitive strategy use and reading ability. These students were also observed during the course of the study to determine whether the study's metacognitive strategies mentioned were actually used during non-instructional times. Students' interview responses before strategy instruction indicated that both groups used reading behaviors about reading as reading strategies. After metacognitive strategy instruction, only students in the experimental group stated text connections, visualization, and questioning as strategies used to aid comprehension of expository text. This further suggested that the experimental group was significantly affected by metacognitive strategy instruction. Findings for this research study suggested that after metacognitive strategy instruction non-proficient students' reading comprehension improved significantly on The Test of Reading Comprehension (TORC-3).

Supplementary instruction has been used extensively to accelerate struggling readers' progress however, schools need to consider methods that have been examined for their effectiveness. This quasi-experimental study explored the effect of two supplementary instructional approaches, CORI-STAR and Guided Reading, on accelerating struggling readers' growth in reading comprehension, reading motivation, and metacognitive awareness, as well as their transference of strategies to their classroom reading groups, their application of reading strategies, and their metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies. Struggling third- and fourth-grade students were invited to participate in an 8-week supplementary instructional reading group. Fifty students with parental consent were then randomly assigned by classrooms to either the CORI-STAR or Guided Reading approach. CORI-STAR combined (a) the engaging and motivational elements of Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) developed by John Guthrie, and (b) a metacognitive component, Strategic Thinking Applied to Reading (STAR), consisting of explicit instruction on metacognitive awareness, modeling, think-alouds, and reflective thinking. The Guided Reading approach was implemented according to Fountas and Pinnell's recommendations. The results revealed statistically significant time (pretest, posttest) by treatment interactions with large effect sizes favoring the CORI-STAR group on (a) three comprehension measures  WRMT-PC, QRI-4 questions, and QRI-4 retelling and (b) three metacognitive awareness measures to assess students' awareness of strategies, their application of strategies, and their metacognitive awareness of the declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge of regulating their use of reading strategies. Performance on the Motivations for Reading Questionnaire did not show a statistically significant interaction for time by treatment. However, on another measure of motivation, choosing to take home books for reading, CORI-STAR students outperformed those in the Guided Reading group. Both groups were perceived by their teachers to transfer strategies to classroom use. Thus, students in the CORI-STAR group improved more than Guided Reading students on reading comprehension, metacognitive awareness, and their knowledge and use of reading strategies as a result of the intervention.

38223964,Palincsar (1987),1987,"To determine the effect of training in reciprocal teaching on collaborative learning, a study of six middle school remedial reading classes was undertaken. Reciprocal teaching is a method in which the teacher participates both as a leader and as respondent. Before the experiment began, the teachers were trained for a day in reciprocal teaching and introduced to principles of collaborative learning, such as the joint role of student and teacher in acquiring comprehension strategies, the role of teacher modeling, and the importance of allowing students to lead discussions. Participants were 63 experimental and 66 control students. After pretesting, the teachers in the experimental classes introduced collaborative learning, and four reading comprehension strategies. Twenty days of reciprocal teaching followed, with each teacher implementing new stages in the process at the same time. Control groups used traditional basal reading instruction. During a 5-day maintenance phase, subjects completed daily assessment measures, after which students in both groups completed summarization and questioning transfer measures as a posttest. Three of the teachers were more comfortable with reciprocal teaching than the others, although assistance from leaders helped all six groups receive the same quality of instruction. Results revealed a significant improvement in experimental students' accuracy with recall and interpretation of material they read independently. Experimental subjects scored significantly higher on the posttests as well. It is also important that the students enjoyed collaborative learning, made gains in metacognition, and exhibited few behavior problems in the unstructured setting.

Over a 4-week period, parents, teachers and graduate assistants read about 70 picture books to each participant (N=48, mean age 4 6). The experimental group received books with text rich in explicit metacognitive terms.

Results from pre-test to post-test show firstly, that exposing children to explicit metacognitive vocabulary resulted in significantly more metacognitive verb production in story telling but no improvement in metacognitive language comprehension.

40294948,Philbrick (2002) MSR,2002,"The comprehension of nonfiction text is often a difficult skill for elementary students to master. Because of its technical vocabulary, unfamiliar formats, and specialized organizational patterns, students often find the reading of expository text more difficult than narrative stories. Often, however, teachers assume if students can read stories, they can read textbooks. Research has shown that this is not always so. The purpose of this study was to determine if teaching children to actively process their social studies textbook using metacognitive reading strategies improved comprehension of the text. One hundred thirty-one fifth grade students in a rural midwestern intermediate school participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (1) a combination of metacognitive strategy and social studies content instruction, (2) a strategies only condition, or (3) a social studies content only group. During an eleven-week period, students received two 45-minute lessons a week. Students learned the use and value of four metacognitive strategies (i.e. predicting, questioning, thinking-aloud, and summarizing) and practiced them using either their social studies text or a piece of children's literature. Instruction in metacognitive strategy use resulted in significant gains in reading comprehension scores and increased metacognitive awareness in both the combined and the strategies only groups. In addition, the combined strategy group scored significantly higher on comprehension than either of the other groups. Interviews with students a month after the instruction ended revealed that they continued to use the strategies and found them helpful in comprehending fiction and expository text.",['Metacognition and self-regulation'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,Low ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '11']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 104:\n[¬s]""ZW&’V$ k:?K%’KX^V?K 0""W&&J ^: yV$$—^JJK[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 104:\n[¬s]"",=:^""K ZW&’V$ k:?K%’KX^V?K 0""W&&J ^: yV$$—^JJK[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 104:\n[¬s]"",=:^""K ZW&’V$ k:?K%’KX^V?K 0""W&&J ^: yV$$—^JJKS[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,2,"['Page 104:\n[¬s]""$^; 9^9?W 7%VXK ""JV$$K$[¬e]""', 'Page 105:\n[¬s]"" ?\xad& :V’K$ X%V\xad: \xad&=JX %K""K^—K ?WK ""&’D^:V?^&: & 9 %KVX^:7 $?%V?K7^K$ V:X $&""^VJ $?=X^K$S \xadW^""W \xadV$ %K9K%%KX ?& V$ ?WK ""&’D^:KX $?%V?K7^K$ Ty0 7%&=”E[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 104:\n[¬s]"" $^; 9^9?W 7%VXK ""JV$$K$[¬e]""', 'Page 105:\n[¬s]"" ?\xad& ""JV$$K$ \xad&=JX $K%—K V$ ?WK ""&:?%&JS & % :& $?%V?K7^K$ T-0 S 7%&=”E[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 104:\n[¬s]""$^; 9^9?W 7%VXK ""JV$$K$[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 117:\n[¬s]""k: ?W^$ $?=X]S ?WK %K$KV%""WK%S \xadW& \xad^JJ DK WK%K^:V9?K% %K9K%%KX ?& V$ ?WK 4VH<\\=P<*\\ %V:X&’J] V$$^7:KX ?\xad& 9^9?W 7%VXK ""JV$$K$ ?& &:K & 9 ?WK ?W%KK ?%KV?’K:?

The curriculum of this experimental program was composed of five separate but integrated parts. Part A was a debate about intellectual issues of both high and low pertinence. Part B concerned practice in critical thinking skills through exercises drawn from a variety of sources. In Part C, students were encouraged to use the critical thinking skill categories to identify instances in which critical thinking skills were absent. Part D contained value issues of both high and low pertinence. The final part of the program, part E, consisted of a student-directed independent learning project. Student volunteers from the upper one-half of their respective classes were selected for the study.

The aim of both studies was to validate Klauer's theoretical claim of “paradigmatic” transfer, i.e., transfer based on an understanding of the deep structure of induction-type problems (Klauer, 1988). Klauer's theory of paradigmatic transfer implies that children trained with a program like the Denktraining will be relatively undistracted by differences in surface features between the inductive tasks from the training program and new inductive tasks. Participants in the first experiment were 9-year-old children from special schools (N = 31), while 7-year-olds from regular elementary education (N = 119) participated in the second experiment. Training was accomplished using Slenders and Resing's (1995) standardized training procedure. Transfer was tested for a set of inductive tasks of which the surface features varied in similarity to the Denktraining tasks  The tasks were superficially equivalent, similar, or dissimilar. Effects on the superficially equivalent and superficially similar tasks were put on a par with practice effects  effects on the superficially dissimilar tasks were taken to indicate paradigmatic transfer. To assess even better of whether the Denktraining's effects surpass practice effects, in the second experiment a practice condition was included. The results found in the first experiment seem to support Klauer's theory of paradigmatic transfer  the results obtained in the second experiment do not. In analyzing the conflicting nature of the findings, we discuss a plausible alternative explanation of the outcome of the first experiment.

The present study attempts to address both theoretical and practical concerns in reading by comparing the effectiveness of two forms of instruction on fourth-grade students'' strategy use, metacognition, and comprehension. Three schools in Los Angeles county participated in the present study, yielding a total of 259 fourth-grade students. Over the course of this five-day study, students were assessed along three major dimensions  strategy use, metacognition, and comprehension. The methods used in this study were based on cognitive theory and models of learning and were refined through successful collaboration with teachers and other education professionals. The data produced in this study identified several processes involved in comprehension and instructional factors that facilitated comprehension. What is encouraging from these results is that, with only four days of instruction, students appeared able to learn and apply the reading comprehension strategies that were presented to them. Moreover, students from both high and low reading ability groups exhibited oognitive and metacognitive gains from using these strategies. The present study can thus serve as a model for translating theory into practical classroom applications that enhance learning outcomes.

Drawing on recent findings of research on metacognition and schema theory, the strategy combines instructional techniques involving student use of graphic overviews with reciprocal teaching instructional techniques designed to engage student metacognitive processing during reading. The four steps of the strategy are  (a) activation of prior student knowledge and teaching of vocabulary and concepts necessary for reading the text, (b) use of graphic overviews to represent the text structure, (c) reading of the text and having students generate questions and summaries to integrate the information contained in the text with the graphic overview, and (d) review of the text content and student-generated questions and summaries. Seven elementary teachers and their students enrolled in a Summer School reading program were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions. The experimental group was trained to use the instructional strategy in a series of workshops over a four-week training period. Teachers were required to practice the strategy in daily reading lessons. The control group received the same amount of training, but in a comprehension instruction strategy based on schema theory. Both groups received weekly observations, feedback, and additional informal coaching sessions from trained observers. Teacher implementation of the instructional strategies was determined from observer ratings on checklists designed for each strategy. Results indicate that both groups of teachers were successful in implementing their respective instructional strategies. Effects of training on student performance was assessed using pretest and posttest measures of (a) student ability to generate summaries and questions of text they had just read, (b) reading achievement (assessed by both standarized and informal tests), and (c) ability to write narrative and expository prose. Experimental-group students had substantially higher scores on measures of summary and question generation and moderately higher scores on tests of reading achievement. Several of these effects were statistically significant. The results are consistent with findings of previous research. Also, the observed effects on student reading comprehension are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further development of instructional strategies based on metacognition and schema theory.",['Metacognition and self-regulation'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 62:\n[¬s]"" - Q—9-Q 6Q6/6K^-&% ;9j——Q[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 62:\n[¬s]"" - Q—9-Q 6Q6/6K^-&% ;9j——Q[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 62:\n[¬s]"" - Q—9-Q 6Q6/6K^-&% ;9j——Q[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,4,"['Page 60:\n[¬s]""Nj6 67\'j^ ^6-9j6&; °6&6 &-K8—/Q% -;;7\'K68 ^— ^j6;6 9Q-;;6;u[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 60:\n[¬s]"" Nj6 67\'j^ ^6-9j6&; °6&6 &-K8—/Q% -;;7\'K68 ^— ^j6;6 9Q-;;6;u[¬e]""']",,8,"['Page 60:\n[¬s]"" Nj6 ;^?86K^; 7K ^j6 ;?//6& ;9j——Q ""&—\'&-/ °6&6 ®—&/68 7K^— 67\'j^ 9Q-;;6; —&\'-K7•68 J% \'&-86 Q6‘6Qu[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 60:\n[¬s]""Nj6 67\'j^ ^6-9j6&; 7K ^j6 6=""6&7/6K^ °6&6 6K&—QQ68 7K ^j6 :K7‘6&;7^% —® 4&6\'—K S?//6& S9j——Q A6-87K\' 2K8—&;6/6K^ F&—\'&-/u Nj6 ""&—\'&-/ 6K&—QQ; ""&6;6&‘796 -K8 6=""6&76K968 ^6-9j6&; °j— -&6 -9^7‘6Q% ;66X7K\' 4&6\'—K 96&^7®79-^7—K -; &6-87K\' ;""697-Q7;^;u""\n"" S6‘6K —® ^j6 ^6-9j6&; °6&6 &-K8—/Q% -;;7\'K68 ^— 67^j6& 6=""6&7/6K^-Q —& 9—K^&—Q \'&—?""; ?;7K\' - ^-JQ6 —® &-K8—/ K?/J6&;u 4K6 ^6-9j6& °-; ""&6 ;6Q69^68 ®—& ^j6 6=""6&7/6K^-Q \'&—?"" -; ;j6 j-8 ""-&^797""-^68 7K - ""&6‘7—?; ;^?8% 7K °j79j ;j6 j-8 Q6-&K68 ^j6 7K;^&?9^7—K-Q ;^&-^6\'% ^-?\'j^ 7K ^j6 9—K^&—Q \'&—?"" 9—K87^7—K —® ^j6 ""&6;6K^ 6=""6&7/6K^u Nj6 ;^?86K^; 7K ^j6 ;?//6& ;9j——Q ""&—\'&-/ °6&6 ®—&/68 7K^— 67\'j^ 9Q-;;6; —&\'-K7•68 J% \'&-86 Q6‘6Qu Nj6 67\'j^ ^6-9j6&; °6&6 &-K8—/Q% -;;7\'K68 ^— ^j6;6 9Q-;;6;u[¬e]""']",NA,,Class,NA,As above.,,['Cluster RCT'],"['Page 60:\n[¬s]""S6‘6K —® ^j6 ^6-9j6&; °6&6 &-K8—/Q% -;;7\'K68 ^— 67^j6& 6=""6&7/6K^-Q —& 9—K^&—Q \'&—?""; ?;7K\' - ^-JQ6 —® &-K8—/ K?/J6&;u[¬e]""']",NA,,Yes,"['Page 60:\n[¬s]""Nj6 67\'j^ ^6-9j6&; 7K ^j6 6=""6&7/6K^ °6&6 6K&—QQ68 7K ^j6 :K7‘6&;7^% —® 4&6\'—K S?//6& S9j——Q A6-87K\' 2K8—&;6/6K^ F&—\'&-/u""\n""S6‘6K —® ^j6 ^6-9j6&; °6&6 &-K8—/Q% -;;7\'K68 ^— 67^j6& 6=""6&7/6K^-Q —& 9—K^&—Q \'&—?""; ?;7K\' - ^-JQ6 —® &-K8—/ K?/J6&;u 4K6 ^6-9j6& °-; ""&6 ;6Q69^68 ®—& ^j6 6=""6&7/6K^-Q \'&—?"" -; ;j6 j-8 ""-&^797""-^68 7K - ""&6‘7—?; ;^?8% 7K °j79j ;j6 j-8 Q6-&K68 ^j6 7K;^&?9^7—K-Q ;^&-^6\'% ^-?\'j^ 7K ^j6 9—K^&—Q \'&—?"" 9—K87^7—K —® ^j6 ""&6;6K^ 6=""6&7/6K^u Nj6 ;^?86K^; 7K ^j6 ;?//6& ;9j——Q ""&—\'&-/ °6&6 ®—&/68 7K^— 67\'j^ 9Q-;;6; —&\'-K7•68 J% \'&-86 Q6‘6Qu Nj6 67\'j^ ^6-9j6&; °6&6 &-K8—/Q% -;;7\'K68 ^— ^j6;6 9Q-;;6;u[¬e]""']",NA,

In order to investigate whether all aspects of this model have to be carried out under regular classroom conditions, three different strategy programs (Strat+CSR+MSR vs. Strat+CSR vs. Strat) and a control condition were compared. Within a pre-, post-, and retention-test design with 20 classes, comprising of 593 fifth-graders (11 years), development of strategy knowledge, reading comprehension, school-related self-efficacy, and motivational orientation towards learning goals were assessed. While all strategy-oriented programs proved to enhance reading competence, understanding of reading strategies and competence for application of reading strategies, gains in self-efficacy did not differ from the control condition.

However, despite significant training effects, students who were resistant and those who were responsive to training were identified.

All significant gains were made by the two experimental groups. Females in all three groups scored significantly lower than males on the CTSR posttest, although the gender effect was neutralized when students were categorized according to Lawson's criteria for concrete, transitional, and formal.

Researchers worked with teachers in Connecticut and Massachusetts schools over a 2-year period. Teachers were trained to deliver a five-part program developed to inculcate practical intelligence by emphasizing five sources of metacognitive awareness  knowing why, knowing self, knowing differences, knowing process, and revisiting. A broad range of assessments was administered in a pre–post design both to the children receiving the practical intelligence program and to matched control children. We found that the program successfully enhanced both practical and academic skills in each of the target skill areas (reading, writing, homework, and test-taking) in children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds attending diverse types of schools. These results are discussed in terms of the acquisition of cognitive and metacognitive insights during adolescence and the promise such insights hold for enhancing adolescent achievement over and above traditional g-based approaches to learning.

The results indicate that the students in the experimental group improved their critical thinking skills compared to their own initial level and compared to their counterparts in the control group. Improved critical thinking skills were observed in a new biological context and nonbiological everyday topics, suggesting generalization of thinking skills across domains. The experimental students scored significantly higher than the control on a knowledge test, suggesting that “knowledge of facts” as one educational goal and “learning to think” as another, need not conflict, but rather can interact with each other.
