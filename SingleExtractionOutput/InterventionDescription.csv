The text structures are presented in an order – comparison, problem and solution, cause and\neffect, sequence, and description based on previous research (Meyer et al., 2002). Students receive practice in applying their skills within\neach text structure before proceeding to the next text structure. The ﬁrst 10–12 lessons are dedicated to showing the use of the comparison\ntext structure with topics, such as elephants, favorite U.S. Presidents, Olympic athletes, and whales.
