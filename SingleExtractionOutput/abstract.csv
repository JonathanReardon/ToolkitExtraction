abstract
"The purpose of this study was to determine if instruction in the Six Traits improved third grade students' writing abilities and their attitudes towards writing. A control group recieved no instruction in the traits of idea and content, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency and conventions while the experimental group did receive instruction. Writing samples were taken from both groups prior to instruction. Instruction lasted approximately one semester. Another sample was taken in January. Students at Wichita State University scored all of the samples, and then pre and posttest scores were compared for the two groups. A writing attitude survey was also administered in the fall and in January. Once again, pre and posttest scores were compared. It was concluded that instruction in the Six Traits significantly effected third grade students in the traits of voice and word choice."
"Fluent oral reading is essential for success in elementary school. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of enhanced reading fluency instruction for struggling readers. The intervention was provided to small groups of students at risk for reading difficulties. Students were assessed on key early literacy skills. Second-grade students who were at risk for reading failure and who received supplemental intervention scored higher on measures of fluency than students who received only typical classroom instruction; the effects of enhanced fluency instruction were evident across different dosages for many children at risk for reading failure. In addition, statistically significant improvements and relationships were evident for oral reading fluency and comprehension. We discuss guidelines for developing and using the intervention in other classrooms."
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a classroom-teacher-delivered reading intervention for struggling readers called the Targeted Reading Intervention (TRI), designed particularly for kindergarten and first-grade teachers and their struggling students in rural, low-wealth communities. The TRI was delivered via an innovative Web-conferencing system using laptop computers and webcam technology. Seven schools from the southwestern United States were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions in a cluster randomized design. All children in the study (n = 364) were administered a battery of standardized reading skill tests in the fall and spring of the school year. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted to estimate mixed models of children's 1-year growth in Word Attack, Letter/Word Identification, Passage Comprehension, and Spelling of Sounds. Results showed that struggling readers from experimental schools outperformed those from control schools on all spring reading outcomes, controlling for fall scores. "
"The first strategy was a mastery learning strategy in which the students were provided with immediate feedback of results, corrective procedures, and additional time and help, if needed. All students in this class were brought to an 85% correct level of achievement in each unit (85ML Class). The second strategy was a mastery learning strategy (see above) in which all students were brought to a 75% correct level of achievement in each unit (75ML Class). The third strategy was a conventional teaching-learning strategy in which students read the programmed text on each unit, were given a test over that unit, and moved on to the next unit (CONV Class). Students learned three sequential units of matrix arithmetic in a programmed text format. The material was developed by Block (1970). Prior to the experiment, students were administered a pre-test on matrix arithmetic. Further, prior to each learning unit students were asked how interesting they thought the unit would be and how well they thought they would do on the unit. The experiment proceeded as follows. All three classes read unit one of their programmed texts. After they had finished they took a formative test. After the formative test was corrected, those students in the 75ML and 85ML classes who did not attain their appropriate per cent correct were given additional time and help in order to correct their mistakes. The conventional class, on the other hand, was finished with that particular unit. After the students in the two mastery classes corrected their mistakes, they were given a review test over the number of problems that they had incorrect initially which, when done correctly, would bring them up to the criterion level. The learning proceeded in the same manner for all three units. Each day one, and only one, unit was covered. Following the experiment, a summative post-test was given to all three classes. In both the naturalistic and the experimental study achievement was measured by tests based on the content which was covered during the period of time during which the study was conducted. When corrected multiple correlations were used to investigate the relationship of the composite of the antecedent variables and time-on-task, the antecedent variables account for between 25% and 67% of the variation in time-on-task. Since, however, only one, or at most two, of the three antecedent variables could be corrected for attenuation before being placed in the multiple regression analysis it is believed that the findings represent an underestimate of the relationship between the antecedent variables and time-on-task.

"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of reading a model written assignment, generating a list of criteria for the assignment, and self‐assessing according to a rubric, as well as gender, time spent writing, prior rubric use, and previous achievement on elementary school students' scores for a written assignment (N = 116). Participants were in grades 3 and 4. The treatment involved using a model paper to scaffold the process of generating a list of criteria for an effective story or essay, receiving a written rubric, and using the rubric to self‐assess first drafts. The comparison condition involved generating a list of criteria for an effective story or essay, and reviewing first drafts. Findings include a main effect of treatment and of previous achievement on total writing scores, as well as main effects on scores for the individual criteria on the rubric. The results suggest that using a model to generate criteria for an assignment and using a rubric for self‐assessment can help elementary school students produce more effective writing."
"The effects of different types of feedback in computer assisted instruction (CAI) on relational concept learning by young children were compared in this study. Subjects were 89kindergarten students whose primary language was English, and whose performance on the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts was within the average range chosen from classes in a predominantly low income NewYork City school district. Nine relational concepts were selected forCAI over a six-week period, and three conditions of computer-generated feedback--textual, symbolic, and pictorial--were presented to the experimental groups. A control group participated in a color matching game on the computer. Motivational effects were measured by time and trials-to-criterion on the computer, and the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts was used to measure the immediate and delayed effects of CAI on the children's level of knowledge of basic relational concepts. Results indicated that, although children's performance across experimental groups was significantly better than the performance of the control group, there were no significant differences in performance among the feedback groups. These results suggest that learning within a microcomputer environment may be intrinsically stimulating for very young children. "
"Teachers, districts, and states working with the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory have been using a six-trait analytical scoring assessment model for student writing. The six traits are: (1) ideas; (2) organization; (3) voice; (4) word choice; (5) sentence fluency; and (6) conventions. For the last 4 years, the Northwest Regional Education Laboratory has been training teachers to teach students to be assessors of writing using the same six traits. This study was conducted to investigate the usefulness of this approach. Six classrooms of fifth graders participated, 67 in the treatment (integration) group and 65 in the control (observation) group. Teachers were taught scoring strategies and were visited by project staff to assist in implementing them. Pretest scores were very similar for both groups. The treatment group gained the most on those traits receiving the most emphasis in instruction, in proportion to the amount of time spent on them and in the order in which they were introduced; their performance on other traits improved slightly. Students in the control group improved slightly on two traits and remained at nearly the same level on the other four. One figure and two tables present study findings. Appendixes contain the student scoring guide and a scoring guide for adult scorers."
"Programmed instruction is now an established fact. This statement is substantiated by the existence of approximately 83 teaching devices now either on the market or being developed and by the publication of 630 programmed courses. The advent and development of these materials are phenomenal when one considers that as recently as two years ago it would have been difficult to locate a dozen complete programs in the entire country. A considerable amount of research has been done and to date no experimental evidence has been uncovered which definitely indicates that knowledge of results is as important a factor in learning as some authors declare. It was the purpose of the present study to determine whether or not students who have 'the simple pleasure of being right' as Skinner says, will learn a subject better than students who do not know whether or not their responses are correct. Will third and fifth grade pupils using a self teaching program in spelling learn more words when knowledge of results in the form of readily available correct answers is provided than students to whom no knowledge of results is given? Also will third and fifth grade pupils using a self-teaching program in spelling commit fewer errors when knowledge of results in the form of readily available correct answers is provided than students to whom no knowledge of results is given?"
"This study tested the assumption that the effectiveness of feedback with regard to performance, motivation, and affect is moderated by the learners' self-concept. A total of 72 sixth-graders completed a web-based interactive learning program. Half of the sample received feedback and the other half received no feedback. Differential feedback effects were detected. For students with a positive academic self-concept, feedback led to a decline in performance and in mood but an increase in effort. With regard to participants with a negative self-concept, feedback worked against the decrease in mood but did not increase performance and motivation. These findings support the claim that feedback effects should be assessed with regard to (1) multiple dimensions and (2) possible moderating variables."
"The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that performance assessment increases educational value in teaching-learning activities using a quasi-experimental research design. In this research, the three measurement criteria of educational value are suggested as ""improvement & advancement,"" ""sincerity & enthusiasm,"" and ""individuality & wholeness."" A pre-test was administered to 4 classes (156 students) in 7th grade. Classes were divided into an experimental group (2 classes, 79 students) and a control group (2 classes, 77 students), according to the pre-test results. Only the experimental group was involved in the performance assessment for 9 weeks. The results of this study show that performance assessment has a positive effect on the educational value of teaching-learning activities in schools."
Children with learning disabilities may have a problem in interpreting metaphor and need specific guidance and practice. This study found that direct feedback and practice could significantly increase metaphor performance of these children. Further descriptive analyses indicated that grade and reading levels of the subjects correlated with their metaphor performance.
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of peer feedback during the writing process on the writing performance, revision behavior, and attitude toward writing of junior high school students. Two types of feedback, different in the amount of information and reinforcement provided, were compared to a control situation. Three classes each of six volunteer teachers were involved. Each teacher taught both feedback treatments and the control treatment in separate language arts classes. Data from 288 students were analysed with a balanced design using three factors: treatment, sex of the student, and teacher. Analysis of covariance was used with writing performance variables and attitude toward writing; analysis of variance was used with the revision variables. There were nine dependent variables: quality of writing, total words, words per t-unit, paragraph revision, sentence revision, word revision, cosmetic revision, total revision and attitude toward writing. The ten week experiment was preceded and followed by a writing sample and an attitude toward writing assessment. All students completed a core composition curriculum, consisting of five formal assignments. All students were instructed to revise at least twice during the two weeks given for each assignment. In the two feedback treatments, students met in small groups and exchanged papers with fellow students. Following the reading, students completed the feedback instrument provided. A highly structured scale for five aspects of writing was used to give and receive information feedback; a loosely structured form was used to elicit positive comments about the draft in the reinforcement feedback treatment. The control group was given teacher-directed revision activities; no group interaction during the writing took place. Following the experiment, a posttest writing assignment was administered over a two-day period. Both pens and pencils were used to distinguish revision behavior. The attitude measure used initially was administered again. Each pretest and posttest essay was scored holistically by trained raters. Revision was identified by a comparison of the pencil and pen drafts written on successive days. The findings show statistical support for the effect of peer feedback. The experimental treatment achieved statistical significance at .05 or beyond for five dependent variables: quality of writing, paragraph revision, sentence revision, word revision, and total revision. For attitude toward writing, the effect of the treatment was evident in a significant treatment by sex interaction. Sex of the student had a significant main effect on quality of writing, total words, paragraph revision, and attitude toward writing. Correlations of quality of writing with other variables suggest that composition teachers should encourage length in the number of words, extensive revision, and positive attitudes toward writing."

"The effects of dynamic testing procedures on Raven Coloured Matrices performance, visual scanning procedures, test anxiety, and orientation to the test situation were assessed. The subjects were 72 third-grade children. The results supported the hypotheses of the study showing that (1) dynamic assessment procedures involving either verbalization or elaborated feedback lead to higher levels of Raven Matrices performance; that (2) dynamic assessment modifies visual search behaviors; and that (3) dynamic assessment reduces test anxiety and negative orientation to the testing situation. The results are interpreted as offering construct validation to the assessment approaches used."
"Two experiments explored the feasibility of training mildly retarded adolescents to solve class-inclusion problems. In Exp I, using 42 Ss (mean CA 177.80 mo; mean MA 107.91 mo), the effects of training consisting primarily of feedback were investigated. In Exp II, using 72 Ss with CA and MA similar to Ss in Exp I, training with feedback alone vs training with feedback plus a counting strategy were compared. Both experiments assessed the generality of training effects to specific training and/or posttest formats. Results suggest that training was generally effective in improving performance with untrained class-inclusion problems on immediate and delayed posttests. Feedback training with pictorial stimuli appeared to be effective regardless of posttest format. The effects of the other training method/format combinations varied according to posttest format."

"The purpose of part 1 of the investigation was to measure several beginning reading behaviors of first, second and third grade special education children for comparison with classmates who were not in special education. It was believed that direct and daily measurement of these behaviors would reveal substantial differences between the two groups. These differences could then be used to define the progress necessary to successfully treat deficient beginning reading behaviors among special education children. Subjects of part 1 were enrolled in the first, second or third grade in regular elementary school classrooms. They also attended special education resource classrooms. The treatment part of this study was begun for purposes of determining if specific treatment produced more proficient reading behavior than traditional treatment. From among all first, second and third grade children identified by traditional identification procedures in Part 1, 24 were selected for specific treatment. A contrast group of 24 children, treated by traditional instruction procedures, was also selected from the larger population."
"The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of individualized written feedback, oral group feedback, and no feedback on learning music. Eighty secondary-level students participated in this study. The results indicate that oral group information feedback promotes significantly more learning than does individualized written feedback or no feedback."

"The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effect of peer feedback on the quality of student writing and the amount and kind of revision behavior. Ninety-three sixth graders in six intact classrooms wrote and revised six stories, the last one being used as data for this study. Instruction varied across groups in the following manner: RI/PP students received revision instruction and revised stories with a peer; PP students revised stories with a peer but did not receive revision instruction; RI students received revision instruction but revised stories alone; C students had neither revision instruction nor help from peers. Chi-square analysis indicated that revision behavior was influenced by instruction. Quality of writing analysis revealed significant differences across groups on both rough and final drafts. Peer feedback seemed to help students write initially superior rough drafts but was not consistently linked to improvement of content between rough and final drafts. Successful surface structure editing occurred with or without peer feedback. "
"This study examines the practice of charting scores in precision teaching for skill acquisition. Two separate studies were conducted, one comparing the effect of recording daily scores on a linear graph with that of keeping daily raw score data, the other comparing use of semilog charts with use of raw scores. In each study the group was divided in half and received each of two treatments (charting on linear or semilog graphs and keeping raw scores) for a 2 week period. Average raw score gains for each test condition were then compared. Results of the first study showed gains made while charting daily scores on a linear graph to be significantly greater than gains made while recording raw scores. Results of the second study indicated no significant difference between gains made while charting daily scores on semilog graphs and gains made while recording raw scores."

"Investigated the effects of success feedback, failure feedback, and no feedback on a scholastic aptitude test administered immediately after feedback was given. Sham scores, obstensibly from a similar test administered 2 days previously but actually randomly determined, were given to 233 male and female 7th graders immediately before they took a test that consisted of items from the nonverbal battery of the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test. Ss given success feedback (i.e., told that they had received a high score on the previous test) scored significantly higher (p < .02) than Ss given failure feedback. The group receiving no feedback was not significantly different from the average of the 2 feedback groups"

"Six remedial reading teachers in a large, rural school district participated in a form of professional development called Teaching as Intentional Learning, based on an inquiry process. Their topic of inquiry was formative assessment. Professional development comprised both direct instruction and inquiry learning in teachers’ own classrooms. This study describes the strategies they experimented with, their professional growth in formative assessment, and effects on students. All six teachers showed important professional growth, as indicated by their own reflections and also by their supervisor’s observations. In First Grade, at‐risk students assigned to these project teachers had increased reading readiness scores on one measure (DIBELS PSF) compared with at risk students assigned to non project teachers."
"The goal of the study was to obtain data regarding what informational feedback and/or social reinforcement messages during microcomputerized drill and practice, under actual classroom conditions using typical microcomputer software, have the greatest efficacy for student achievement of multiplication facts. Students involved in the study were third graders from a typical elementary school. Students who were identified special education students or who achieved an eighty percent mastery of the learning task as of the fourth, and last, posttest were excluded from the study. The computerized drill and practice was provided to the students over a two month period after regular classroom teachers instructed the students in multiplication facts based on addition skills already possessed by the students. Commercially available software was modified to provide the experimental treatments. Three levels of informational feedback: no feedback, knowledge of results only, and knowledge of results plus a corrective procedure leading the student to the correct response, were crossed with two levels of social reinforcement: no reinforcement and twenty percent variable ratio praise following correct student responses. A posttest-only experimental design employed a four minute, ninety item speed test given after each set of two iterations of the three hundred item drill and practice program. Learning progressed steadily throughout the experiment for all six treatment groups, and learning curves generally had low probabilities that their slopes could be zero. Inspection of these learning curves showed the feedback treatments clustered by levels while the reinforcement treatments did not. Analysis of variance revealed that a main effect developed for the feedback variable by the fourth posttest, which was reanalyzed using only feedback levels in the model. No such effect appeared for the reinforcement variable and there were no significant interactions. Planned comparisons of group means revealed that both knowledge of results in combination with the corrective procedure and no feedback produced significantly superior achievement than knowledge of results alone. While knowledge of results plus corrective procedure was superior to no feedback, the results did not reach significance. The results are discussed and interpreted in terms of cognitive science learning theory."
"Tested the hypothesis that intrinsic motivation would be maintained after receipt of nonthreatening, task-related evaluation and undermined after repeated nonreceipt of feedback or receipt of controlling normative grades. Nine classes comprising 261 6th-grade pupils were randomly assigned to 1 of these 3 feedback conditions and were given 2 interesting tasks, 1 quantitative and 1 qualitative, on 3 sessions over 2 days. The manipulation was applied after Sessions 1 and 2, and no feedback was expected or received after Session 3. Experimental measures consisted of Session 3 performance scores and of the results of a questionnaire, given after Session 3, that tapped interest and patterns of attribution of success and effort. Results confirm the hypothesis and show significant group differences in intrinsic motivation as reflected in both performance and attitudes. It is suggested that intrinsic motivation is not merely a function of collative stimulus properties but depends on the dynamic interaction between the stimulus and the individual (i.e., on the degree to which a task continues to be perceived as challenging and as providing satisfying increments in one's knowledge about one's competence."

"A total of 200 fifth- and sixth-grade students with high or low school achievement were given interesting divergent thinking tasks in each of three sessions. Individual comments, numerical grades, standardized praise, or no feedback were received after Sessions 1 and 2. Results confirmed that at Session 3 (posttest), interest, performance, and attributions of effort, outcome, and the impact of evaluation to task-involved causes were highest at both levels of achievement after receipt of comments. Ego-involved attributions were highest after receipt of grades and praise. These findings support the conceptualization of the feedback conditions as task involving (comments), ego involving (grades and praise), or neither (no feedback). The similar impact of grades and praise would not be predicted by cognitive evaluation theory. I discuss the importance of distinguishing between task- and ego-involved orientations in the study of continuing motivation."

"The computer tutor Summary Street addresses the problem of passive comprehension strategies by providing content feedback on students' written summaries. The design of this tool is motivated by the belief that articulating their understanding in their own words helps students lay the conceptual foundation to learn about new subject areas. Graphically presented feedback, based on latent semantic analysis, guides this process to ensure adequate content coverage within given length constraints and the avoidance of redundant, irrelevant, overly detailed, or plagiarized information. In this chapter, we review our experimental findings, showing not only improved summary writing when using the tool but also transfer to independent summary writing, among middle school students. Students who practiced summarizing without guidance did not perform as well. Moreover, Summary Street users also scored higher on comprehension test items that required gist-level understanding. Results of a verbal report study with college students indicated better metacognitive awareness of appropriate strategies among those who composed summaries with Summary Street. Thus, our suggestion that better macroprocessing strategies may emerge from guided practice receives support from these findings."

"Various testing-the-limits procedures were employed in administering the Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices Test to 203 second grade and 230 fourth grade children. Tests of impulsivity, neuroticism, extroversion, intelligence and school achievement were also given. The main results showed that testing-the-limits procedures which involved verbalization and feedback were efficacious in maximizing performance on the Raven. The puzzle form of the test generally led to higher scores than the picture version for the second but not fourth graders. Differential analyses were carried out to establish how construct, concurrent and predictive validity of the Raven were affected by the salient testing-the-limits procedures involved. Analysis was also done with the personality variables and revealed how their effect interacted with various test administration procedures. The results were discussed in theoretical and practical terms. © 1979."
"Comprehension is the goal of reading. However, students often encounter reading difficulties due to the lack of background knowledge and proper reading strategy. Unfortunately, print text provides very limited assistance to one's reading comprehension through its static knowledge representations such as symbols, charts, and graphs. Integrating digital materials and reading strategy into paper-based reading activities may bring opportunities for learners to make meaning of the print material. In this study, QR codes were adopted in association with mobile technology to deliver supplementary materials and questions to support students' reading. QR codes were printed on paper prints to provide direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questions. Smartphones were used to scan the printed QR codes to fetch pre-designed digital resources and scaffolded questions over the Internet. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of direct access to the digital materials prepared by the instructor using QR codes and that of scaffolded questioning in improving students' reading comprehension. The results suggested that direct access to digital resources using QR codes does not significantly influence students' reading comprehension; however, the reading strategy of scaffolded questioning significantly improves students' understanding about the text. The survey showed that most students agreed that the integrated print-and-digital-material- based learning system benefits English reading comprehension but may not be as efficient as expected. The implications of the findings shed light on future improvement of the system. (Contains 5 tables and 5 figures.)"
Discussion of various types of feedback used in computer-assisted instruction focuses on a study of low-ability eleventh graders that compared the effectiveness of answer until correct (AUC) feedback with knowledge of correct response (KCR) feedback. Achievement data on posttests as well as time data are analyzed. (11 references) (LRW)
"Background. Previous models of the effects of feedback account for lower-order learning outcomes but do not adequately describe experimental findings for higher order learning.
Aims. Based on a connectionist model of feedback effects, this investigation aims to show that feedback that allows only one learner response facilitates proposition specific verbatim encoding, while feedback that requires the learner to try again on error facilitates relational fuzzy encoding. Sample and methods. Volunteer high school students were randomly assigned to one of 5 print-based lesson treatments that consisted of four science expository texts with adjunct inference-level questions covering science principles. The five treatments included delayed feedback, single-try immediate feedback, multiple-try immediate feedback, and two control treatments, questions without feedback, and text only.
A post-test given 5 days after instruction was designed to measure both verbatim and fuzzy outcomes. Results. Multiple-try immediate feedback was best for paraphrased post-test questions (fuzzy) and worse for verbatim post-test questions. Conclusions. Fuzzy trace theory complements a connectionist model of feedback, and may provide a fruitful approach for describing the effects of feedback on different learning outcomes."
"The 6+1 Trait Writing model (Culham 2003) emphasizes writing instruction in which teachers and students analyze writing using a set of characteristics, or ""traits,"" of written work: ideas, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, conventions, and presentation. The Ideas trait includes the main content and message, including supporting details. The model has not been adequately studied using experimental methods. In order to provide evidence on the effectiveness of this approach, the study reported here was designed as a large-scale effectiveness trial (Flay 1986). The study addressed the following confirmatory research question: What is the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement in writing? It also investigated two exploratory research questions: (1) What is the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement in particular traits of writing?; and (2) Does the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement vary according to student gender or ethnicity? Data for the cluster-randomized experimental study were collected from participating grade 5 teachers and students in 74 Oregon schools. The benchmark estimates indicate that use of the 6+1 Trait Writing model significantly increased student writing scores during the year in which it was introduced to schools. After controlling for baseline writing scores, the estimated average score of students in the treatment group was 0.109 standard deviations higher (p = 0.023) than the estimated average score of students in the control group. An intervention with this effect size would be expected to increase the average level of achievement from the 50th to the 54th percentile. The findings remained stable when tested using alternative choices for the analytic sample and the model specification. In addition to the analysis of holistic writing scores, exploratory analyses found statistically significant differences between control and treatment group students on three of the six specific outcome measures of particular writing traits--organization, voice, and word choice-- with effect sizes ranging from 0.117 to 0.144 (p = 0.031 to 0.018). For the other three traits: ideas, sentence fluency, and conventions, the mean outcome score of students in the treatment condition was higher than that of students in the control condition, but these differences were too small to be considered statistically significant given the size and sensitivity of the experiment. Additional exploratory analyses of holistic writing scores found no differential effects of the intervention based on student ethnicity or gender."
Mastery of sequentially arranged objectives may serve as a continuous progress approach for student advancement through the curriculum. For the slower students it may be a kind of insurance policy against eventual failure in the upper grades. Early diagnosis and placement in a continuous monitoring system should prevent the child's problems from being neglected until they reach proportions too serious to allow for full remediation later in the school program. The need for such diagnosis and monitoring has been evidenced by the estimated 5 to 20% of students in grade school classrooms who are failing.
"This effectiveness study examined a supplemental reading intervention that may be appropriate as one component of a response-to-intervention (RTI) system. First-grade students in 31 schools who were at risk for reading difficulties were randomly assigned to receive Responsive Reading Instruction (RRI; Denton, 2001; Denton & Hocker, 2006; n = 182) or typical school practice (TSP; n =240). About 43% of the TSP students received an alternate school-provided supplemental reading intervention. Results indicated that the RRI group had significantly higher outcomes than the TSP group on multiple measures of reading. About 91% of RRI students and 79% of TSP students met word reading criteria for adequate intervention response, but considerably fewer met a fluency benchmark. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

"This study was designed to investigate precision teaching as a method to remediate deficits with learning disabled students in the math, perceptual and auditory areas. It also investigated the effects of precision teaching with a regular education population in the math and spelling areas. The study was also interested in determining for both the regular and special education populations whether there would be any significant differences in utilizing varying frequency rates. Finally, the effects of precision teaching were studied on the self-concept and anxiety levels of both the regular and special education populations. The study was significant because the special education population had not been studied in connection with precision teaching precedures and if found successful could be a viable program for this group. This study was conducted in 1978 on a group of 120 subjects who were identified as special education students and on another group of 180 subjects who were identified as regular education students. In the special education population 60 subjects were treated using precision teaching procedures. An additional 90 subjects in the regular education group received the treatement. These students were compared to control groups of 60 and 90 students for the special and regular education populations respectively. Procedures included: (1) screening and identification using standardized tests and one-minute probes, (2) remediation utilizing the building of basic tool skills with one-minute practice sheets and, (3) the employment of direct and daily measurement as a technique for monitoring student performance. The experimental and control students in both populations were compared on a pre, post 1 and post 2 design to determine program effectiveness over the regular school year and the summer vacation period. The results of the study indicated a significant difference in favor of the experimental group over the control group on the variable of math probes on the post 1 testing for the special education population. No significant differences were observed for the auditory and visual areas. The results of the study also indicated that student self-concept and anxiety levels between the experimental and control groups were not significantly different for either the special and regular education population."
"The effects of conceptual hierarchies as supplemental aids to textual materials was investigated. Sixty-five fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students were given a 1000-word reading passage describing the real number system. One group received a conceptual hierarchy in addition to the text; one group was asked to draw this hierarchy from the information in the text; a control group read the text. The group that was provided with the hierarchy scored significantly better than the control on Production and Comprehension subtests. The ineffectiveness of the draw hierarchy treatment was due to the inability of subjects to construct the hierarchy. Those able to complete the hierarchy scored significantly higher than control on Production and Comprehension subscores and on the total test. No differences were found between the successful drawers and the group provided with a hierarchy."
"Research in reading comprehension and reading strategies suggests that cognitive modeling by teachers is an effective instructional tool to teach reading comprehension processes. However, despite evidence suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach, little is known about how teachers most effectively model these processes and how students are influenced by modeled strategies. A Social Cognitive Theory of Learning was used as a theoretical basis for this investigation which was designed to address two major questions: (1) What are the relative merits of characteristics of general modeling when applied to cognitive modeling of reading comprehension processes? (2) How do the characteristics of modeling, when applied to cognitive modeling of reading processes, influence the comprehension and comprehension monitoring of eighth grade readers? One hundred average eighth grade readers were randomly assigned to one of four modeling conditions: (1) Passive Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling only. (2) Active Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling with statements to explain the functional value of the modeled strategy and to foster self-efficacy in the students. (3) Full range Cognitive Modeling. Modeling same as ""active"" group with feedback, (4) Control. No modeling. Students met with the researcher in small groups for three sessions. Each session consisted of the researcher's verbal cognitive modeling of a passage being read, followed by the students individually applying the modeled strategy to another passage, followed by an oral retelling of the passage and comprehension questions. Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance for oral retelling scores and for comprehension question scores, and with a chi-square for strategy use. Strategies were predetermined or emerged from qualitative analysis of the think-aloud protocols. Results revealed: (1) There were significant differences among groups for use of reading comprehension monitoring strategies (p $<$.05). The modeling conditions did significantly more monitoring of their comprehension by applying the modeled strategies and by using their own un-modeled strategies. (2) There were significant differences among groups for reading comprehension based on oral retellings (p $<$.05). Active and fullrange modeling groups had significantly better retellings than the control and passive modeling groups. (3) There were no significant differences among groups for performance on comprehension questions."
"Eighteen Venezuelan elementary school teachers, trained to provide constructive written feedback on their sixth grade students' mathematics homework, did so three times weekly for ten weeks. In addition to learning and attitude outcomes, aptitude-treatment interactions were examined among treatments and student ability, attitude, and sex. (Author/BS)"
"The purpose of this study was to investigate use of the microcomputer to enhance poor readers' comprehension of text. The study focused on two text-centered comprehension strategies, questions interspersed in text and immediate feedback, which were used in conjunction with computer-presented passages. The feedback capability of the computer was of primary interest, and was demonstrated by providing feedback regarding students' answers to interspersed questions. Poor readers were used as subjects because of indications from prior research that they are less able to organize text and to monitor their performance during reading than are good readers, suggesting that poor readers may benefit from externally-provided comprehension aids. There were three experimental groups: (a) a text-only group which read computerized text without interspersed questions or feedback, (b) a group reading the text with interspersed questions, but without feedback, (c) a group receiving feedback in addition to interspersed questions. Subjects were 66 sixth and seventh graders reading one to two years below grade level, who were randomly assigned to treatments. All subjects read 250-word expository passages, one science-related and one social studies-related. Re-reading of relevant portions of passages after answering interspersed questions was permitted. A cloze test and multiple-choice test consisting of factual and inferential questions were administered after each passage. The following relationship among groups was predicted for each of the four dependent variables (cloze, multiple-choice test, factual questions, inferential questions): Group 1 < Group 2 < Group 3. A series of four 3 (type of presentation) x 2 (type of passage) ANOVAS with repeated measures on passages was performed. Study results failed to confirm the predicted relationships, as no significant differences were found among treatment groups for any of the dependent variables. Additional results showed that subjects did little re-reading of text and spent about half the time reading feedback as was expected. The latter finding may have contributed to the lack of significant results. It was concluded that poor readers will not necessarily be motivated to read all material presented to them on a microcomputer. It was suggested that only game-like or other highly motivating comprehension-related CAI materials be used with poor readers and that effectiveness of such materials be researched further."

"Self-instructional booklets simulating computer-assisted instruction (CAI) were used to teach four basic concepts in science to first graders in three treatment groups which received different types of feedback--hints, correct answers, and right or wrong. A control group received neither instruction nor feedback. A multiple-choice test was administered to the 47 students in the 4 groups following completion of the instruction. It was found that the group provided with hints had the highest mean; the group provided with the correct answer had the second highest mean; the group provided with right/wrong feedback had the second lowest mean; and the control group had the lowest mean. The results were inconclusive with respect to the hypotheses as there were no significant differences among the group means. Possible causes are suggested in the discussion that concludes the report. A table summarizing the means and standard deviations, a flowchart showing the hypothesized model of relationships between different forms of feedback, and samples of generalities, practice items, and test items are provided. Lists of 12 references and 10 prior IDD&E working papers are also included. "

"The purpose of this study was to test Gagné's hypothesis that attention to prerequisites should be more effective than repeated practice of a final task when learning intellectual skills. Ninety eighth-grade general science students studied self-instructional materials on the construction and interpretation of graphs. After each of three lessons each subject took a diagnostic test covering the objectives of the instruction. Subjects in Group 1 received additional instruction on prerequisites as remediation. Subjects in Group 2 received additional practice items as remediation, and subjects in Group 3 received no remedial activity. Students receiving remedial instruction did significantly better than those receiving only main-line instruction. Students receiving additional instruction on prerequisites did significantly better than those receiving additional practice items as remediation."
"This study measures the effectiveness of Collaborative Learning Assessment through Dialogue (CLAD) on reading achievement in inclusive classrooms in the USA. The CLAD process involved students collaboratively completing multiple-choice quizzes, using dialogue and critical thinking to reach consensus and receiving immediate feedback on their responses. The procedure was implemented in three third-grade classrooms (n = 30) in a midwestern elementary school for the purpose of reducing a significant achievement gap between these students and those who attended a different school within the same district (n = 95). The effectiveness of CLAD was assessed though a comparison of students' scores on a state reading achievement test designed to measure their ability to construct, examine, and extend meaning in text. The test was administered to both groups in October 2003 and again in March 2004. While both the intervention and comparison groups showed significant improvement in reading achievement scores, the intervention group showed significantly greater growth with a mean growth rate of 19.78 (0.004) and effect size of 0.60. The achievement gap between the two groups of students was reduced from a 13-point gap in their mean scores to a three-point gap. (Contains 3 tables.)"
"We investigated effects of instruction in the process of revision on children's knowledge of the revision process, on their ability to make revisions on paper, and on the quality of their writing. Fifteen sixth graders received instruction in the process of revision; 15 controls read good literature. After instruction, each child wrote a story, was interviewed about potential revisions, and was given an opportunity to make changes on the first copy and then write another draft. The main variables for knowledge of the revision process were number of spots suggested for revision and average specificity of suggested changes. The main variable for ability to make revisions on paper was total number of revisions made. A quality score was obtained for the first and final drafts. Instruction did affect knowledge of the revision process, and it enhanced revision efforts. Quality judgments tended to increase across drafts for the revision group, whereas they remained stable for the controls."
"We developed a new model for iList, our system that helps students learn linked list. The model is automatically extracted from past student data, and allows iList to track students' problem-solving behavior in order to provide targeted feedback. We evaluated the new model both intrinsically and extrinsically. We show that the model can match most student actions after a relatively small sequence of observations, and that iList can effectively use the new student tracker to provide feedback and help students learn."

"Having students express their understanding of difficult, new material in their own words is an effective method to deepen their comprehension and learning. Summary Street® is a computer tutor that offers a supportive context for students to practice this activity by means of summary writing, guiding them through successive cycles of revising with feedback on the content of their writing. Automatic evaluation of the content of student summaries is enabled by Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). This article describes an experimental study of the comprehension and writing tutor, in which 8th-grade students practiced summary writing over a 4-week period, either with or without the guidance of the tutor. Students using Summary Street® scored significantly higher on an independent comprehension test than the control group for test items that tapped gist level comprehension. Their summaries were also judged to be significantly superior in blind scoring on several measures of writing quality. Students of low-to-moderate achievement levels benefitted most from the tool."
"This study examined the educational effects of repeated curriculum-based measurement and evaluation. Thirty-nine special educators, each having three to four pupils in the study, were assigned randomly to a repeated curriculum-based measurement/evaluation (experimental) treatment or a conventional special education evaluation (contrast) treatment. Over the 18-week implementation, pedagogical decisions were surveyed twice; instructional structure was observed and measured three times; students’ knowledge about their learning was assessed during a final interview; reading achievement was tested before and after treatment. Analyses of covariance revealed that experimental teachers effected greater student achievement. Additional analyses indicated that (a) experimental teachers’ decisions reflected greater realism about and responsiveness to student progress, (b) their instructional structure demonstrated greater increases, and (c) their students were more aware of goals and progress."
"This study assessed the effect of contrasting mastery learning on performance among high- and low-achieving students. Subjects were 48 high- and 40 low-achieving first graders, who received either a typical commercial basal reading series mastery learning treatment or an alternative mastery learning treatment that adhered more closely to principles of frequent testing, corrective feedback, and technically sound measurement. Analyses of covariance on two achievement post-tests indicated an interaction. Use of the alternative procedures resulted in better scores for low- but not high-achieving pupils. Implications for practice are discussed."
"Assessed the effects of computerized teacher feedback systems within curriculum-based measurement (CBM) in the area of spelling. 27 special education teachers selected 2 mildly handicapped pupils who had been classified as learning disabled, emotionally disturbed, or educable mentally retarded. For 15 wks, each teacher was assigned randomly to 1 of 2 CBM groups, enhanced feedback or unenhanced feedback, or to a control group. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) conducted on fidelity of treatment measures indicated that CBM teachers implemented procedures with comparable accuracy, except that the enhanced feedback group timed their instructional modifications more accurately. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that spelling achievement of students in the enhanced feedback group exceeded that of controls."
"The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of ongoing skills analysis to Curriculum-Based Measurement (CBM). Thirty special educators were assigned randomly to treatment groups, including a control condition and different levels of CBM analysis, one of which included graphed performance indicators with skills analysis; one, graphed performance indicators only; and another, graphed performance indicators with ordered lists of student spellings. Teachers who used skills analysis effected, better achievement than controls and than CBM teachers who had no additional analysis. Although the mean achievement of students whose teachers had skills analysis was greater than that of teachers who inspected ordered lists of errors, the difference in achievement was not reliable, and the teachers who inspected errors effected greater growth than controls. Implications for CBM practice are discussed."
"30 special education teachers were assigned randomly to 3 groups: curriculum-based measurement (CBM) with expert system advice (CBM-ES), CBM with no expert system advice (CBM-NES), and control (i.e., no CBM). Ss implemented treatments for 18 wks. Both CBM groups achieved better than the control group, with no reliable difference between CBM groups. Analysis of the Ss' instructional programs indicated that CBM-NES Ss provided more direct instruction on skills, whereas CBM-ES Ss utilized more drill and practice. Results are discussed in terms of types of instructional adjustments and ongoing assessment information that may be useful in teacher planning."
"This study examined the effectiveness of innovative curriculum-based measurement (CBM) classwide decision-making structures within general education mathematics instruction, with and without recommendations for how to incorporate CBM feedback into instructional planning. Forty general educators, each of whom had at least one student with an identified learning disability for math instruction, were randomly assigned to three groups: CBM with classwide reports that summarized information and provided instructional recommendations, CBM with reports but without recommendations, and contrast (no CBM). Results indicated that only the CBM teachers who received instructional recommendations designed better instructional programs and effected greater achievement for their students."
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of immediate knowledge of results and a token economy system, singly and in combination on the learning of English as a second language. Two hundred forty students were randomly selected out of four randomly selected schools. Within each school the subjects were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. Four teachers were randomly selected to teach six consecutive English units. The students in each school were instructed together, then they returned to three separate classrooms where they were assigned identical work sheets. Group 1. When all questions were answered the correct answers were read immediately. Group 2. When all questions were answered, the group leader read the correct answers, then he checked the worksheets. While collecting the sheets the group leader dispensed tokens whose number depended on the number and value of correct responses. Students were then allowed to exchange tokens/or reinforcers. Group 3. After the questions were answered, the students were allowed to leave. A criterion referenced test was developed and validated (Pophan, 1978). The test was analyzed with a 2 x 3 factorial analysis of variance design. When appropriate the Tukey method (Winer, 1971) was used. In both settings (rural and urban) immediate knowledge of results groups achieved significantly higher than the control groups. The combination of immediate knowledge of results and a token economy group, achieved significantly higher than both the immediate knowledge of results and the control groups. No significant differential effects on English language achievement of urban and rural students as a function of their participation in different reinforcement strategies was found. The findings were consistent with previous research. This provides a positive step towards establishing the generalizationability of the reinforcement theory and thus strengthening it."
The current study examined the effect of inserted questions in text with and without feedback on students’ estimates of posttest performance. The literature examining students’ estimates of posttest performance consistently has reported very low relationships between students’ estimates of performance and their actual posttest performance. The current study found that requiring students to answer inserted questions during reading and then providing students feedback on their responses led to significantly more accurate student estimates of posttest performance than reading without inserted questions. The theoretical and applied implications of the results are described.
"The aim of this experimental study was to investigate the effects of accuracy feedback on text comprehension. A total of 198 sixth-grade students (M = 11.78 years; 50% girls) participated in the computerised experiment in which an accuracy feedback condition (treatment group) was contrasted with a feedback-free condition (control group). Results showed that the overall performance of the control and treatment group children did not differ, neither as part of the dynamic test nor in a subsequent post-test. Measures based on Rasch model estimates were introduced to evaluate the effects of accuracy feedback on item-level performance indicating potential benefits of accuracy feedback. Implications for applying feedback on text comprehension in assessment settings are discussed. "
"Accelerated Reader (AR) is a whole-group reading management and monitoring programme that aims to foster the habit of independent reading among primary and early secondary age pupils. The internet-based software initially screens pupils according to their reading levels, and suggests books that match their reading age and reading interest. Pupils take computerised quizzes on the books they have read and earn AR points related to difficulty. The evaluation of Accelerated Reader involved 349 pupils in Year 7 who had not achieved secure National Curriculum Level 4 in their primary Key Stage 2 (KS2) results for English (across four secondary schools). 166 pupils were randomly allocated to receive the intervention for 22 weeks in phase one during their first year at secondary school, with the other 183 acting as a control and then receiving the intervention in phase two. 10 pupils left their existing schools and were unable to provide post-test data despite follow-up. The intervention was organised either by taking pupils out of regular classes or making pupils stay after regular school time. The pattern varied between schools."
"Seventy-eight white lower-middle class 11th and 12th grade males participated in an experiment designed to assess the effects of variations in locus of control on the efficiency of three types of reinforcement on linear programmed instruction performance: (l) no confirmations, (2) confirmations, (3) feedback from the experimenter to be exchanged for a monetary reinforcer. Dependent measures were gains from pre- to posttest and number of correct responses on the program. Although no significant differences were found for gain scores. Internals made more correct responses when no confirmations or money were available than did Externals, and Externals who were paid for their performance made as many correct responses as did Internals. Results are discussed in terms of the different motivational bases from which Internals and Externals operate."

"This study examined the effects of parental involvement on students' writing ability and scores. Parents attended a training session where they received instruction in new English Language Arts Standards, the stages of the writing process, strategies for developing writing as a recursive process, and in the criteria of a scoring rubric used to evaluate their child's writing. The study consisted of three phases. In Phase 3, parents scored their child's writing sample and discussed areas of improvement with their children based on the information shared in the training session and using a writing rubric. Students in the experimental groups represented three socioeconomic classes. Results indicated that when students had an understanding of the criteria for evaluation, their writing scores improved. Moreover, when their parents became knowledgeable of the writing process and the criteriafor evaluation, they were better able to interact with their children to discuss areas in need of improvement. As a result of this study, parents gained a more thorough understanding of the school's expectations for quality writing and parents expressed greater confidence in their ability to be a supportive audience for their child's writing."
"Posttest performance resulting from total feedback, partial feedback, and no feedback in a multiple-choice test were compared. About 1,400 fifth and sixth graders first took a completion-format pretest which was used to match triads. Next, they all took a multiple-choice test, one-third under each of three experimental feedback conditions-total immediate feedback, partial immediate feedback, and no feedback. Finally, all examinees took a completion-format posttest. As predicted, those taking the multiple-choice test without feedback had significantly lower posttest performance than either feedback group. An hypothesized aptitude-treatment interaction was found between achievement level and feedback treatment. An unexpected interaction between sex and feedback also emerged."
"A demonstration program was conducted in which 54 innercity children classified as educable mentally retarded were selected on the basis of age, IQ, family income, race, and achievement scores. They were then placed into self-contained classrooms with two classes being taught by precision-teaching procedures and two classes being taught by the methods particular to their teachers. Tesults showed that a high percentage (60 percent) of the children taught by precision-teaching procedured were capable of acquiring the basic skills necessary for regular-class placement."

"In an ex post facto causal-comparative research design, this study investigated the effectiveness of Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE) programs on raising the student writing achievement. Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) writing achievement scores from the 2010 administration were utilized for this study. The independent variable for the study was the usage of an AWE program. The dependent variable for the study was TCAP writing achievement scores. In this study, the TCAP writing achievement scores of two groups of eighth grade students from each school were analyzed and compared. School A was the experimental group that received AWE as a treatment, and School B was the control group that did not utilize AWE as part of its writing instruction. Both schools were from similar demographic backgrounds. This study took place in rural, upper middle Tennessee. Four research questions with corresponding null hypotheses guided this study. The first three null hypotheses related to the following variables: comparison of control group and experimental group, economically disadvantaged students, and gender. For these three null hypotheses, an ANCOVA test was performed at the 0.05 level of significance. The covariate for these tests was pre-test data. The first null hypothesis dealt with the comparison of the experimental group and the control group and was rejected due to the statistically significant difference in TCAP writing scores. The second and third null hypotheses dealt with economically disadvantaged students and the gender of students, respectively, with the use of AWE. Both of these null hypotheses were retained due to no statistically significant difference in TCAP writing scores between the comparison groups. The last null hypothesis pertained to special education students and the use of AWE. Nonparametric tests were utilized for this subgroup with no statistically significant difference being found between these two groups. Therefore, the fourth null hypothesis was retained. From the study, one may conclude that students who participate in AWE programs do increase in writing achievement more than students who do not participate in AWE programs as part of their writing instruction. One recommendation for practice is that teachers should understand the value of AWE programs when working with students of different ability levels. A recommendation for further research is that a longitudinal study should be considered to evaluate the long-term results and transferability of writing skills."
"Three 40 minute science lessons, which had been carefully planned to minimize extraneous teacher behavior, were taken by the writer with Form II (Grade 7) classes. During the lessons pupil responding and teacher reacting variables were experimentally manipulated. A posttest of achievement was administered following the lessons and predicted posttest scores were calculated from the regression of a number of pretest measures (e.g., verbal ability, prior knowledge, attitudes) on this posttest. Residual achievement scores, calculated by subtracting predicted from obtained posttest scores, were used in analyses of variance to determine treatment effects. Results indicated that pupil participation, in the form of overt pupil responses to teacher questions, was a weak variable having little effect on pupil achievement. However, regular positive teacher reactions to pupil responses facilitated pupil achievement significantly more than minimal teacher reactions."
" In this study, a peer assessment-based game development approach is proposed for improving students' learning achievements, motivations and problem-solving skills. An experiment has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a science course at an elementary school. A total of 167 sixth graders participated in the experiment, 82 of whom were assigned to the experimental group and learned with the peer assessment-based game development approach, while 85 students were in the control group and learned with the conventional game development approach. From the empirical results, it was found that the proposed approach could effectively promote students' learning achievement, learning motivation, problem-solving skills, as well as their perceptions of the use of educational computer games. Moreover, it was found from the open-ended questions that most of the students perceived peer assessment-based game development as an effective learning strategy that helped them improve their deep learning status in terms of ""in-depth thinking,"" ""creativity,"" and ""motivation.""[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"
"A study was undertaken to evaluate how a mastery approach to teaching history on the high school level influenced student achievement and attitudes. Mastery learning is interpreted to include assumptions regarding student learning capability as well as specified curricular/instructional/evaluative procedures. Essential to mastery learning strategy are feedback corrective procedures such as diagnostic tests. Participants in the study included 69 high school students assigned to three sections of United States history. The sections were based respectively on highly specific formative tests plus learning correctives, relatively general formative tests and learning correctives, and relatively general formative tests with no learning correctives. An objective test measured student cognitive mastery of unit material and a questionnaire measured student attitudes toward the unit. Tests and questionnaires were statistically analyzed. Findings indicated that there was a significant difference among the three treatment groups and that the group exposed to highly specific formative tests and learning corrections outperformed the other two treatment groups. The conclusion is that a combined feedback-corrective strategy in social studies instruction can improve student achievement and result in more favorable unit evaluations."
"Ss in three different schools were randomly assigned to Group R, the regular version of a self-instructional program, Group O, the program with knowledge of results omitted, or Group I, the program with the order of some sections of the program inverted. In two of the schools Groups O and I did significantly better on the posttest than did Group R, but in the third school there were no group differences on the posttest. An interpretation is offered in terms of the more active role of the student assigned to a mutilated version of the program."
"This dissertation investigated the utility of curriculum-based measurement (CBM) writing indices to monitor student progress and serve as an academic intervention. The participants were 257 third-, fifth-, and eighth-grade students from regular and special education. These students were divided into three experimental groups which received CBM writing probes at the beginning and end of the 12-week study (control group), on a weekly basis (weekly group), or on a daily basis (daily group). Students'' writing samples were scored using production-dependent (Total Words Written, Words Spelled Correctly, and Correct Writing Sequences), production-independent (Percentage of Words Spelled Correctly and Percentage of Correct Writing Sequences), and accurate-production (Correct Minus Incorrect Writing Sequences) CBM indices, and an analytic scoring system. Students'' scores on the writing portion of the Illinois Standards Achievement Test were also recorded. The data were used to answer four primary research questions. First, of the various CBM written expression scoring indices, which measures were most appropriate for students of different ages? Second, did more frequent administration of CBM writing probes affect students'' writing skills? Third, did the use of CBM written language probes have a differential effect on the writing achievement of students of different educational classification or gender? Fourth, what was the relationship between students'' scores on the CBM indices and the ISAT? This dissertation found that the production-independent scoring measures were not sensitive to student gains; however, the production-dependent and accurate-production scoring measures were equally as capable of monitoring increases in students'' scores over time. The results of the present study indicated that the students who generated more frequent writing samples generally did not have higher scores than the control students at the end of study. The present study also found that over time, students in special education had similar rates of gain on the CBM scoring indices as students in regular education. Additionally, it was found that girls had significantly higher scores on the majority of CBM indices and the ISAT Total Writing subtest than boys. Finally, the present study revealed a strong relationship between students'' scores on the various CBM scoring indices and on the ISAT Total Writing subtest."
The proposition that learner control of instruction can be facilitated by directly affecting the student’s perception of learning need was investigated. Students in one experimental condition were continuously advised during instruction of their learning performance and needs (amount and sequence of content) in relationship to the desired acquisition of rules at a given mastery criterion and were allowed to make instructional decisions. It was hypothesized that this condition would prove more effective on posttest performance than conditions without advisement — either partial learner control or conventional learner control. Results are discussed in reference to an information-processing approach to the design of computer-based instruction.
"Study of 105 Brunei secondary school students investigating interactive effects of feedback levels using aptitude treatment interaction (ATI) approach and cognitive styles (field dependent-independent (FDI) in multimedia presentations found differences between no feedback (NF) and knowledge of results (KOR), NF and elaborated feedback (EF), none between KOR and EF. Field-independent students outperformed field dependent in all treatments. (PEN)"

"Twenty pairs of students from seven special education resource rooms (elementary and intermediate grades) were assessed on the structure of the instruction they received. Their reading achievement was measured three times during the year. The instructional programs for 10 experimental students were to be based on their teachers' use of continuous-evaluation procedures; these students were assessed also on an accuracy of implementation scale. Results indicated that the procedures were administered and the data charted appropriately, and that teachers'considered the procedures time efficient and useful in monitoring student progress. However, the procedures rarely were used to evaluate instructional programs, make instructional changes, or monitor the effectiveness of the changes. No statistically significant differences in instructional structure or achievement were found between experimental and control Ss."
"Goals 2000 set forth a bold vision for U.S. students: they would be ""first in the world in science and mathematics"" by the year 2000. Performance indicators such as the TIMSS-R (1999) and NAEP (2000) reports suggest that U.S. students have not yet reached that goal. This study intended to learn how specific assessment strategies might contribute to improved student performance in science. This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of formative assessment with reflection on students' motivational beliefs, self-regulatory skills, and achievement in elementary science. The study aimed to find out whether and how classroom applications of formative assessment during science instruction might influence fifth-grade students' attitudes and self-perceptions about science learning, self-regulatory learning behaviors, and achievement. To explore the effects of the assessment intervention, the study utilized a mixed methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative investigations of treatment and control groups during a four-week intervention period. Quantitative measures included student selfreport surveys administered pre- and post-treatment and an end-of-unit science test. Qualitative measures included classroom observations, student interviews (posttreatment), and a teacher interview (post-treatment). Findings indicated that the fifth-grade students in this study had positive attitudes toward science and high levels of self-efficacy for science. Results suggested that these elementary students employed a wide variety of cognitive and metacognitive strategies to support science learning. Findings revealed that these fifth graders believed formative assessment with reflection was beneficial for science learning outcomes. Research results did not show that the formative assessment intervention contributed to significant differences between treatment and control groups. However, the data revealed different levels of academic achievement and self-regulation for students in specific instructional services subgroups (i.e.. gifted, regular education, special education, and ESL). For example, high achieving students reported higher levels of self-regulatory learning behavior than other fifth grade students. Findings suggested that elementary science instruction that includes classroom applications of formative assessment with reflection may provide support for science learning and the development of self-regulatory learning behavior. However, widespread implementation of this practice in elementary science classrooms represents significant challenges for today’s educators, due to time limitations and increasing accountability pressures in our nation's schools."
"ASSISTments is a web-based math tutor designed to address the need for timely student assessment while simultaneously providing instruction, thereby avoiding lost instruction time that typically occurs during assessment. This article presents a quasi-experiment that evaluates whether ASSISTments use has an effect on improving middle school students' year-end test scores. The data was collected from 1240 seventh graders in three treatment schools and one comparison school. Post-test (7th grade year-end test) results indicate, after adjusting for the pre-test (6th grade year-end test), that students in the treatment schools significantly outperformed students in the comparison school and the difference was especially present for special education students. A usage analysis reveals that greater student use of ASSISTments is associated with greater learning consistent with the hypothesis that it is useful as a tutoring system. We also found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that teachers adapt their whole class instruction based on overall student performance in ASSISTments. Namely, increased teacher use (i.e., having more students use the system more often) is associated with greater learning among students with little or no use, suggesting that those students may have benefited from teachers adapting their whole-class instruction based on what they learned from ASSISTments use reports. These results indicate potential for using technology to provide students instruction during assessment and to give teachers fast and continuous feedback on student progress."
"The effects of the self-monitoring and attribution training on accuracy and fluency of reading, as well as reading comprehension, and reading attribution of second-grade poor readers were examined. The participants were assigned in three experimental groups and one control group. One experimental group was encouraged for self-monitoring and self-correction by token-economy. The second group was instructed to attribute reading success to effort and ability, and failure to lack of effort. The third experimental group obtained a combination of self-monitoring and attribution training, and the control group practiced reading without feedback. All students showed improvement in reading fluency and comprehension. Self-monitoring training, as well as attribution training and their combination improved reading accuracy. Changes toward more internal attribution were obtained only in the experimental groups with explicit attribution training applied"

"This exploratory study investigated 100 Israeli 9th graders who used two different group-metacognitive support methods in online mathematical inquiry—group feedback guidance (GFG) and self-explanation guidance (SEG)—compared to a control group (CONT). The study evaluated each method's effects on students': (a) mathematical inquiry ability: problem solving, explanations, mathematical feedback in online forum discussions, and transfer ability; and (b) self-regulated learning (SRL) measures (self-report questionnaires and metacognitive feedback in online forum discussions). Metacognitive support methods, based on IMPROVE self-questioning strategies, appeared in pop-up screens and provided the two experimental groups with differential cues for problem-solving processes. Mixed quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that GFG students outperformed SEG students in most mathematical and SRL measures and the CONT students in all measures. In addition, SEG students outperformed the CONT students in mathematica..."
"This study investigated variables which contribute to acquisition and maintenance over one week of trained verbal rehearsal in the performance of serial recall by 84 kindergarten and first-grade children. Children with low and high pretest recall were given rehearsal training with or without trial-by-trial feedback alone, along with a “looking” strategy, or along with the looking strategy and with instructions to compare the relative success of rehearsal and looking. Consistent with findings on acquiring Piagetian abilities, initial performance was a major determinant of effects of training on posttest performance. Only high scorers increased in rehearsal and recall during the pretest. Given training, however, all groups of low and high scorers increased in use of rehearsal, recall, and reported verbal memory aids from pretest to posttest one week after training. Feedback aided all groups' recall during training, but did not affect maintenance of rehearsal."
"There are many established reading strategy training programmes, which explicitly teach strategic and meta-cognitive knowledge to improve reading comprehension. Although instruction in strategy knowledge leads to improvements in meta-cognitive skills, the effects do not always transfer to reading comprehension. Therefore, to investigate preconditions for knowledge transfer, two different strategy training programmes were implemented in nine classes of Grade 6 students (N = 148) over the course of one school year. One programme involved teacher-directed instruction of declarative meta-cognitive knowledge (Reading Detectives; Ruhl & Souvignier, 2006). The other aimed at improving executive meta-cognition by guided practice: students worked with a computer program based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) (conText) and received immediate feedback on written summaries. Although both groups improved their strategy knowledge to the same extent, the conText group showed a greater improvement in reading comprehension. These findings suggest that guided practice, which is characterised by intensive practice and individualised corrective feedback, is superior to explicitly teaching strategy knowledge.

"This study analyses the effectiveness of adaptive formative feedback to boost strategic search decisions and performance when students are asked to answer a set of questions in a task-oriented reading situation. We compared automatic feedback that included information about the right answer with feedback that also included the connection between the students' strategic search decisions and their performance. Ninety-two high school students read two non-continuous texts. They received feedback during a training phase, and then they read and also received feedback with a similar text in a final phase. Text and questions were presented using a new computer-based technology that provided automatic adaptive feedback depending on the experimental condition: right-answer feedback, strategic-search-decisions feedback and placebo feedback. We found that strategic-search-decisions feedback improved strategic decisions over right-answer and placebo feedback in the final text, which in turn improved question-answering performance. Some positive effects were also found during training. These results open new possibilities to adaptive automatic procedures to teach task-oriented reading skills to students. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

"The study includes two experiments to analyse the effects of automatic formative feedback designed to promote the transfer of self-regulation of strategic decisions in task-oriented reading (e.g. answering questions from an available text). Secondary-school students read and answered multiple-choice comprehension questions from two texts having them available while receiving consistent feedback about their performance and strategic decisions. Then, they read a different text and answered questions also with the text available, but receiving no feedback. In Experiment 1, we tested two feedback procedures that differed in task conditions and the feedback information associated to these conditions. The most effective was a procedure that forced students to select relevant text information to answer each question and provided accurate feedback based on that selection. Experiment 2 was designed to disentangle the role played by the selection task from that played by the feedback provided. We found that the two components contribute to transfer the self-regulation strategies, although each one has a specific role for different strategies.

"Can an instructional treatment directly target the cognitive processes which lead to comprehension problem detection in revising? Can such a treatment be effective in enhancing not only the ability to detect such kind of error in revising texts written by others but also the attention to local planning in writing so that comprehensibility be assured? The results of an experimental investigation with 28 6th graders as subjects supported an affirmative answer to these questions. Subjects in the experimental condition, who individually participated in three treatment sessions, significantly outperformed controls in detection of comprehension problems in revising and in comprehensible writing. Some methodological problems are discussed."
"Investigated the impact of a reciprocal peer editing strategy on 29 learning disabled 4th-, 5th-, and 6th-grade students' knowledge about writing and revising, their actual revising activity, and the quality of their writing. Ss learned to work in pairs to help each other improve their compositions. The strategy was taught by special education teachers who were using a process approach to writing instruction in their classrooms and word processing to support the writing process. Ss in the strategy group made more revisions and produced papers of higher quality when revising with peer support than Ss in a process approach control group. On a metacognitive interview, strategy Ss demonstrated greater awareness of substantive criteria for evaluating writing in response to general questions about evaluating and revising particular papers."
"A large literature shows that retrieval practice is a powerful tool for enhancing learning and memory in undergraduates (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006a). Much less work has examined the memorial consequences of testing school-aged children. Our focus is on multiple-choice tests, which are potentially problematic since they minimise retrieval practice and also expose students to errors (the multiple-choice lures). To examine this issue, second graders took a multiple-choice general knowledge test (e.g., What country did the Pilgrims come from: England, Germany, Ireland, or Spain?) and later answered a series of short answer questions, some of which corresponded to questions on the earlier multiple-choice test. Without feedback, the benefits of prior testing outweighed the costs for easy questions. However, for hard questions, the large increase in multiple-choice lure answers on the final test meant that the cost of prior testing outweighed the benefits when no feedback was provided. This negative testing effect was eliminated when children received immediate feedback (consisting of the correct answer) after each multiple-choice selection. Implications for educational practice are discussed. © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press Ltd."

"A propositional structure is set forth that considers: (1) the role of various forms of feedback in eliciting differing motivational orientations toward performance in tasks that reflect ability; (2) the strength of arousal associated with these various motivational orientations as a function of repeated feedback and the age of the performer; and (3) the impact of differing strengths of arousal upon the performance of simple and complex tasks. On the basis of this propositional statement, a series of hypotheses are formulated and tested concerning predicted effects of various forms of feedback upon second, fourth and sixth grade Flemish boys performing simple and complex tasks in a classroom setting. In general, the results are consistent with predictions that the strength of competitive motives, induced by own and other performance feedback, as compared to individualistic motives induced by own feedback and a control condition of no feedback, increase both as a function of trials and the age of the performer, and that these increases in arousal lead to higher levels of performance in simple, but not complex tasks."
"The pause, prompt and praise techniques for helping pupils who have been making slow progress with their reading were developed at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Since then, the procedures have been applied successfully in many centres with both parents and peers as tutors. However, there has, so far, been no attempt to examine the effectiveness of each of the feedback procedures separately. In this study an attempt was made to measure the power of praise by using two parallel groups tutored by cross‐age peers, that is, older pupils. One group was tutored using the standard pause, prompt and praise procedures, whilst the second was tutored similarly but given no praise. A no‐treatment group was used for comparison. Praise was found to be a highly significant factor for success in improving reading. Some of the difficulties to be overcome in setting up a peer tutoring programme are discussed."
"Can an electronic portfolio that is both a multimedia container for student work and a tool to support key learning processes have a positive impact on the literacy practices and self-regulated learning skills of students? This article presents the findings of a yearlong study conducted in three Canadian provinces during the 2007–2008 school year initially involving 32 teachers and 388 students. Due to varying levels of implementation our final data set included 14 teachers and 296 students. Using a non-equivalent pre-test/post-test design, we found that grade 4–6 students who were in classrooms where the teacher provided regular and appropriate use of the electronic portfolio tool ePEARL (i.e., medium–high implementation condition, n = 7 classrooms and 121 students), compared to control students (n = 7 classrooms and 175 students) who did not use ePEARL, showed significant improvements (p < .05) in their writing skills on a standardized literacy measure (i.e., the constructed response subtest of the Canadian Achievement Test-4th ed.) and certain metacognitive skills measured via student self-report. The results of this study indicate that teaching with ePEARL has positive impacts on students’ literacy and self-regulated learning skills when the tool is used regularly and integrated into classroom instruction."
"The effects of two components of formative evaluation (frequency of measurement and data utilization) were compared to isolate formative evaluation components which teachers might routinely use to monitor achievement in learning disabled students. Fifty-two learning disabled and educable mentally retarded elementary students enrolled in regular class programs and receiving reading instruction in a special education resource room were randomly assigned to either a pretest non-data-based change group, a daily measurement non-data-based change group, a daily measurement data-based group, or an untreated control group. Analysis of results of oral reading data supported daily measurement and data-based changes as effective components of formative evaluation."
"Three experiments utilizing auto-instructional materials were undertaken to obtain additional evidence on the use of self-teaching materials. The first two studies to be reported deal with the assumption that information on the correctness of each response must be provided to the student with a minimal delay. In previous studies, immediate 'knowledge of results' (KR) has been provided in a number of ways. In some cases, S is informed of a correct response by some mechanical or electrical device, such as a buzzer or a light. In other cases, particularly when the response required of S is based on direct recall rather than recognition, the desired answer is given to provide S with a standard against which to compare his response. In the latter type, both self-teaching textbooks and teaching machines have been used as the media for the presentation of self-instructional materials. It is believed that by utilizing self-teaching materials, a student may proceed at his own rate, and that he is in no way restricted by the rate at which his peers learn the same material. As a corollary, it is believed that most students can learn a greater amount when using auto-instructional materials ad libitum than they can in 'lock-step' instruction. The question explored by the third study to be reported is: how is the rate of presentation of materials related to the acquisition and retention of the information presented?"

"A 7-month study of 178 students in grades 1-4 at two Blue Ribbon schools compared two daily 20-minute treatments. Eighty-eight students used the 2000-2001 version of Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor (www.cs.cmu.edu/~listen) in 10-computer labs, averaging 19 hours over the course of the year. The Reading Tutor served as a computerized implementation of the National Reading Panel's recommended guided oral reading instruction (NRP, 2000). The Reading Tutor listened to students read aloud, giving spoken and graphical help when it noticed them click for help, make a mistake, or get stuck. Students using the Reading Tutor averaged significantly higher gains across measures of reading ability, especially those involving word level skills (word identification, blending words, and spelling) than their matched classmates who spent that time doing Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) in their classrooms. Additionally, these students trended toward higher gains in fluency and reading comprehension. Overall, use of the Reading Tutor resulted in the types of improvement that would be expected from guided oral reading, but with the benefit of scalability, a problem for human-guided oral reading practice."
"Sixty fourth-grade children were given two different series of the Porteus Maze Test. The first series was given as a baseline, and the second series was administered under one of four different experimental conditions: control, response cost, positive reinforcement, or negative verbal feedback. Response cost and positive reinforcement, but not negative verbal feedback, led to significant decreases in the number of all types of qualitative errors in relation to the control group. The reduction of nontargeted as well as targeted errors provides evidence for the generalized effects of response cost and positive reinforcement."

"The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effect of peer feedback on the quality of student writing and the amount and kind of revision behavior. Ninety-three sixth graders in six intact classrooms wrote and revised six stories, the last one being used as data for this study. Instruction varied across groups in the following manner: RI/PP students received revision instruction and revised stories with a peer; PP students revised stories with a peer but did not receive revision instruction; RI students received revision instruction but revised stories alone; C students had neither revision instruction nor help from peers. Chi-square analysis indicated that revision behavior was influenced by instruction. Quality of writing analysis revealed significant differences across groups on both rough and final drafts. Peer feedback seemed to help students write initially superior rough drafts but was not consistently linked to improvement of content between rough and final drafts. Successful surface structure editing occurred with or without peer feedback."
"The effects of programmed instruction, with and without feedback, under supportive and nonsupportive teacher responses, were investigated to determine the favourable learning conditions for high-anxious children. The sample consisted of 160 sixth-grade boys and girls who scored either high or low on the Test Anxiety Scale for Children (TASC). It was hypothesized that high anxious children would learn and perform better under feedback and supportive conditions, and that girls would perform better than boys under all conditions. The task was learning decimals from a programmed mathematics book. Immediately following the experiment and 3 weeks later, the children were compared on a criterion test. A four-way analysis of variance revealed significant sex and anxiety effects on learning and retention. Low-anxious children generally outperformed high-anxious children, and girls did better than boys under all treatment conditions. Predictions based on the characteristics of high- and low-anxious children that were derived from the work of Sarason and colleagues received little support from the results of this study."
"Piagetian research has emphasized the centrality of conservation in the development of human cognitive processes. Piaget-like studies have, in large part, confirmed the trainability of conservation, and various workers have espoused various training models. The present study investigated the efficacy of a feedback technique (knowledge-of-results) in posttest conservation of substance and quantity. Data was collected from 247 Nigerian subjects using the individual interview method. Statistical analyses, using t-tests, showed a significantly superior performance (p < .05) by the feedback subjects relative to the no-feedback controls. The theoretical implications of the findings, especially as they touch on the Nigerian cultural practice, were pointed out."
"A mixed methodological approach was used to examine the effect of a cross-age tutoring writing program among second- and fourth-grade students in a rural elementary school in Delaware. Pre-test and post-test writing prompts were administered and evaluated using the 6+1 traits writing assessment rubric. Students were assessed qualitatively through written journal responses and group discussions, and interviews were conducted at the completion of the cross-age tutoring writing program. After detailed descriptive statistics were ascertained, an analysis of covariance test was performed. The analysis revealed that there was a statistically significant academic difference between fourth-grade students who participated in the cross-age tutoring writing program and the fourth-grade students who did not participate in the program. There was no statistically significant academic difference between the second-grade treatment and non-treatment groups."

"32 fifth graders (boys and girls) studied a 900-word text followed by a multiple-choice test, and, after 24 hr., were given feedback either on their own test form or on an unused test form. Retesting of half the immediate-test items was done immediately following feedback, of the other half six days later. The results indicated that the confrontation with the initial responses at feedback did not influence the effectiveness of feedback nor the subjects' ability to identify their initial responses at the time of retesting. Implications of the results for Kulhavy and Anderson's interference-perseveration hypothesis were discussed."
"Ninety-seven fifth graders read a 900-word text followed by a multiple-choice test consisting of factual and guess questions that, respectively, could or could not be answered on the basis of the text. They received informative feedback either immediately after the test, after a day, or no feedback. All children were retested 7 days after the initial test and subsequently asked to identify their initial-test responses. On the delayed test, subjects in the feedback conditions outperformed subjects in the no-feedback condition on both types of question, but they did not identify more initial responses correctly. There were no differences between the feedback conditions. Initial-response identification was better for factual than for guess questions. Analysis of identification scores in relation to initial- and delayed-test response sequences suggested that awareness of initial errors may be helpful rather than detrimental for the acquisition of correct responses through feedback."

"Males with learning disabilities in Grades 1 through 4 were pretested to determine subjects who were in the acquisition stage of decoding. Forty-eight boys were randomly assigned to four feedback treatment conditions and orally read consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) nonsense words. Four feedback treatments were manipulated as the independent variable: (a) general, (b) corrective/modeling, (c) corrective/sound-it-out, and (d) no feedback. A one-way analysis of variance revealed a significant difference between types of feedback. Planned orthogonal comparisons demonstrated significant differences for (a) any type of feedback compared to no feedback, (b) corrective feedback (modeling and sound-it-out) compared to general feedback, and (c) modeling compared to sound-it-out on the immediate task measure. Additional discussion suggests implications for instructional practices and critical variables to consider in feedback research"
"Adjunct question research has typically focused on the effects of adjunct questions on improving the learning of college students. This study investigated the effects of inserted and massed postquestions (inference, main idea, and detail), with and without feedback, on improving the comprehension skills of adolescents labeled as reading disabled. Students practiced using adjunct questions for 6 weeks. The results suggested that inserted questions (and to a lesser extent massed postquestions) were beneficial in improving the comprehension of texts that did not contain adjunct questions. Specifically, the results indicated that (a) inserted questions were more effective than massed postquestions or no questions, (b) massed postquestions were more effective than no questions, and (c) the effects of inserted questions on comprehension increased over the time of treatment. The beneficial effects of feedback were limited to inference and main idea questions."
"A peer feedback tool (Radar) and a reflection tool (Reflector) were used to enhance group performance in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment. Radar allows group members to assess themselves and their fellow group members on six traits related to social and cognitive behavior. Reflector stimulates group members to reflect on their past, present and future group functioning, stimulating them to set goals and formulate plans to improve their social and cognitive performance. The underlying assumption was that group performance would be positively influenced by making group members aware of how they, their peers and the whole group perceive their social and cognitive behavior in the group. Participants were 108 fourth-year high school students working in dyads, triads and groups of four on a collaborative writing task, with or without the tools. Results demonstrate that awareness stimulated by the peer feedback and reflection tools enhances group-process satisfaction and social performance of CSCL-groups. "
"Peer review consists of giving and receiving feedback. Even though research findings suggest that peer review is an effective instructional approach, little research has examined the effects of giving feedback separate from receiving it. The purpose of this study was to examine whether practice evaluating and reviewing papers of unknown students, using genre-specific evaluation criteria, could help students learn how to revise their own papers more effectively, resulting in papers of better quality. A total of 145 students in the fourth and fifth grades participated in this investigation. The students were randomly assigned within grade level into three groups: the reviewers, the readers, and the control group. All students responded to two persuasive topics in their homerooms. Those essays served as pretests and were administered on two consecutive days. On the third day, all students received training in evaluation criteria that were based on the elements of persuasion. The students were randomly assigned to the three conditions within their grade level and participated in three days of intervention. The reviewers read persuasive essays, evaluated them using the evaluation criteria, and gave written feedback to the writer. The group of readers read the same essays as the reviewers, but did not provide any feedback. The control group read books that did not relate to persuasion. For the next two days, students revised their pretest essays in their homeroom classrooms. On the third day after the intervention, all students wrote a persuasive essay on a new topic in their homerooms and revised their essay on the next day; this task was done to examine transfer. A week and 2 days after the transfer task, and thirteen days after the intervention, students wrote a persuasive essay on a new persuasive topic and revised their draft the next day; this task was done to examine maintenance. Statistically significant differences were found for quality. The reviewers produced better quality revised drafts for one of the posttest topics compared to the readers and the control group. Also, the reviewers produced papers of better quality on the revision task at transfer compared to the reader and control group and at maintenance compared to the readers. The reviewers produced papers of marginally better quality on the first drafts at transfer compared to the readers but not the control. Statistically significant differences were also found for length. The reviewers wrote longer essays compared to the readers on one of the posttest topics but not the other. Also, the reviewers wrote longer revised drafts at transfer and maintenance compared to the readers. Further, the reviewers produced marginally longer first drafts at transfer and maintenance compared to the readers. Significant differences were also found on a number of persuasive elements in the first posttest. The reviewers gave more opposing positions, rebuttals, and elements for the conclusion compared to the readers and the control. Also, they produced more opposing reasons compared to the control group. Limitations and implications for research and practice are further discussed."
"Peer review is a reciprocal process in which writers both give and receive feedback. Both activities may contribute to student learning; however, few studies have examined the effects of giving feedback separately. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of giving feedback on the quality of the reviewers' own persuasive writing. Fourth- and fifth-grade students (n = 145) received training in evaluation using genre-specific criteria. They were then randomly assigned to three groups: reviewer, reader control, and time control. The reviewers read persuasive essays, rated them, and gave written suggestions. To control for the effect of reading the essays, the reader control group read the same essays but did not evaluate them; finally, the time control group read narratives to control for time and effort. On the immediate posttests, to assess effects on revision, all students revised two essays written at pretest. To assess transfer and delayed transfer, students wrote and revised essays on new topics. On the immediate posttests, students in the reviewer group included more elements to address the opposing position and end with a message to the reader. In addition, reviewers produced better quality final essays than both control groups did on one immediate posttest and the transfer posttest, and better essays than the reader control group did on the delayed transfer. Implications for research and practice are discussed."
"The use of peer response groups in writing classrooms has become increasingly popular in recent years as emphasis has shifted from product to process. For the limited English proficient (LEP) student, however, interaction with peers or teacher has been more restricted. The present study investigated the effectiveness of the use of heterogeneous (in terms of language proficiency and ability) peer response groups with forty-six LEP students in grade four language arts classes. The results indicated significant differences on two measures of fluency for the subjects assigned to peer response groups; however, there was no difference in overall quality of compositions produced."
"This study investigated the effect of type of control and level of feedback during computer-based instruction. Subjects completed a computer lesson about the microscope that presented either mandatory or optional practice questions. Practice was accompanied by either elaboration feedback, correct-answer feedback, or no feedback. Results indicated that level of feedback had a significant effect on achievement and attitudes. Implications for including feedback in computer-based instruction are discussed. "

"72 children (mean age = 6–5) were assigned to 1 of 6 training conditions for speaking skills in a 2 (with or without feedback) × 3 (degree of overt activity) crossed design. Children in the active condition participated directly in three training exercises; each child in the passive condition observed the performance of the child in the active condition to whom he was matched; children in the active-passive condition received a combination of the two previous treatments. Children were given a pretest and immediate and delayed posttests, each of which was comprised of five tasks, four of which aimed at measuring possible transfer to other referential communication behaviors. Posttest evaluations showed that improvements in speaking behavior were related to the feedback condition, but not to the child's initial level of competence as assessed by global performance on the five pretest tasks. The reverse was true for the four transfer tasks. The amount of overt activity did not exert a significant effect on children's performance of any of the five tasks. Possible causes of the difficulty of obtaining transfer in training experiments are discussed."
"The present study investigated the effects of instruction in two revision strategies on the paragraph writing of students with learning disabilities in Grades 6 through 8. The two experimental groups both received instruction in one strategy for revision of mechanics and one for content, but the order of instruction varied. Results suggest that revision instruction for both experimental groups improved scores on an analytic scale for mechanics, regardless of order of instruction, but improvement in content scores was not demonstrated."
"Administered the New Developmental Reading Test—Intermediate Level, Form B, to 228 middle-class 5th graders. Based on the results, 93 good and poor comprehenders were chosen. Ss read an 800-word passage and after every 2 paragraphs received either a meaningful learning question requiring the organization of facts under given concepts, a rote learning question requiring literal recall of passage information, or no adjunct question. For most measures of text recall, good comprehenders recalled more than poor comprehenders; the type of treatment did not have a significant effect. For poor comprehenders, however, meaningful learning post-questions yielded significantly greater recall of facts from the question-related paragraphs than did rote learning post-questions or no questions. On the measure of recall of subordinate material, the performance of the poor comprehenders given meaningful learning post-questions did not differ significantly from that of the good comprehenders, regardless of the kind of treatment the latter received."
"Powerful Learning Conversations (PLC) sought to improve the feedback that teachers give to pupils in Year 9, by training them to apply techniques used in sports coaching. It is based on the idea that feedback in sports coaching is often provided immediately after a task is performed, and delivered in a way that children are more likely to respond positively to. The training programme adopted a 'cascade' model: expert teachers were trained in the approach and then expected to disseminate their training to English and Maths teachers in their school. PLC was developed in the UK secondary school context by the Youth Sport Trust (YST) in collaboration with the University of Exeter. This feasibility pilot study was conducted in 20 schools between January 2014 and November 2014. It had two aims: (1) to explore whether the programme is feasible and ready for a full-scale trial, and (2) to explore the effect on children's attainment and other outcomes of the programme. Key conclusions include: (1) There was no evidence that the programme had an impact on English attainment; (2) The evaluation detected a positive impact on Maths attainment, but this result is not secure and we are not able to draw firm conclusions about the programme's impact; (3) Interviews and observations with teachers found the programme was implemented in different ways and with different levels of understanding in different schools. This could be avoided by ensuring the programme and its underpinning concepts are more clearly defined; (4) The intervention is not ready to be evaluated using a large-scale trial without further development. In particular, it is important that the programme is more clearly defined and less open to interpretation by teachers; and (5) If the programme is taken to a full trial it is recommended that paper-based tests are used. The pilot provided mixed evidence of promise. There was no evidence that PLC had an impact on English attainment. The evaluation did detect an impact on Maths attainment, which was equivalent to six additional months' progress over the course of a year. However, it is important to note that these results, particularly the Maths result, should be treated with caution. The evaluation did not provide evidence of a differential impact on pupils eligible for free school meals or pupils with a low prior attainment. The evaluation provided mixed evidence regarding the programme's feasibility. The training was well attended by teachers and they appeared to be engaged. Nearly all teachers who took part in the training found it interesting, engaging and relevant to their teaching, and believed that their school as a whole would benefit from the programme. The programme is likely to be affordable if it was delivered at scale."
"A considerable amount of attention has focused on reading and mathematics difficulties of elementary-aged students. Significantly less attention has focused on the written expression problems of elementary-aged students, which is problematic given that approximately 6% of the school-aged population may have a disorder in written expression (Luttinger & Gertner, 2001). In an attempt to address this problem, the present study examined the effectiveness of a performance feedback intervention in improving the writing fluency skills of a group of elementary-aged students. In addition, this study attempted to examine whether varying the frequency of feedback affected the amount of improvement observed in students' writing fluency skills. A total of 42 students in three third-grade classrooms participated in the study. Each classroom was randomly assigned to one of three conditions: (a) no feedback; (b) performance feedback intervention once per week; or (c) performance feedback intervention three times per week. Growth in students' writing fluency (i.e., total words written, number of sentences, number of letter sequences) as well as spelling was assessed using a time series design. In addition, a prepost cohort design was utilized to assess changes in students' writing achievement on standardized measures. The results of this study indicated statistically significant differences in students' writing fluency growth (i.e., total number of words written) between the three conditions, with students assigned to the performance feedback intervention three times a week demonstrating more growth than the no feedback condition. No significant differences were detected on students' growth of the remaining writing fluency outcomes (i.e., number of sentences, number of letter sequences) or students' writing achievement on the standardized measures. Implications and future research directions were discussed."
"Novice writers have little control over the text composition process. Being unable to depart from focusing on their representation of the text, they cannot see the potential improvements that might be made to the overall text organization. Based on Vygotsky’s theory, two approaches might be applied to promote the development of the internal dialogue subjects could use to better control their writing: 1) co-action with another writer; 2) interaction with a computer, which prompts and informs. Four experimental situations were set up, resulting from the combination of two factors: the individual or dyadic working mode, and (in case of error) the production (or absence) of a response by the tutorial software concerning text structure. Children age 8 to 9 completed 6 texts (story, argumentation, and description). The expert children working individually benefited the most from the computer prompts. Contrary to usual observations, the dyads did not perform better and exchanged little information about the reasons behind their selection of a given solution. Their dialogue included very few arguments about the structural aspects of the text."
"The effects of immediate knowledge of results, goal setting instructions, and subjects’ sex upon answering multiple choice questions were evaluated in a group of seventh grade students. None of the main effects and none of the interactions reached significance. To further evaluate the lack of significance the actual functionality of the variables was investigated. Control subjects were asked to judge how sure they were of their answers to the test questions, and whether they had adopted the goals. The results indicated that the subjects had intrinsic knowledge of results and failed to adopt specific goals. The findings demonstrate the importance of controlling for these variables in studies of knowledge of results on academic tests."
"Carnegie Learning’s Cognitive Tutor Algebra I Program is a computer-enhanced, interactive learning course that is designed to teach students both in the classroom and in personalized computer sessions. The design of the program includes students spending three days per week in a classroom setting, and two days per week in a computer lab interacting with the course software. The Carnegie software is designed to offer individualized assistance to students,
allowing them to progress at their own pace. Students using the software receive immediate feedback, providing real-time tutoring. The software is designed to understand methods that a student may use to solve a problem, and provides individualized levels of help. The software paces the curriculum based on each student’s comprehension and ability. Student progress is displayed on their computer screen during the lab. Teachers can generate detailed reports of student progress. The class sessions are designed around collaborative student activities and projects. By design, teachers are encouraged to focus their direct instruction to students who need additional help. Course materials include student and teacher editions of textbooks and computer software.
This evaluation of the 2002-2003 Cognitive Tutor Algebra I Program was designed to explore relationships between Algebra I Cognitive Tutor and student’s resulting FCAT and final grade performance, as well as administrators’ and teachers’ opinions about the program."
"Studies the effects of varying levels of interactivity on the learning rate of 98 high school students using four increasingly interactive versions of computer-based interactive video instruction. Students are grouped by ability levels and results are compared for recall rate, instructional time, and acquisition rate. Twenty-two references are listed. "
This study investigated the influence of goal setting and progress feedback on self‐efficacy and writing achievement. Children received writing strategy instruction over sessions and were given a goal of learning to use the strategy of writing paragraphs. Half of the strategy goal children periodically received feedback on their progress in strategy learning. The strategy goal with progress feedback exerted the greatest impact on achievement outcomes to include transfer. The strategy goal without progress feedback provided some benefits compared with the paragraph goal. Future research suggestions and implications for classroom practice are discussed. 
"Two experiments investigated how goal setting and progress feedback affect self-efficacy and writing achievement. Children received writing strategy instruction and were given a process goal of learning the strategy, a product goal of writing paragraphs, or a general goal of working productively. Half of the process goal children periodically received feedback on their progress in learning the strategy. In Experiment 2 we also explored transfer (maintenance and generalization) of achievement outcomes. The process goal with progress feedback treatment had the greatest impact on achievement outcomes to include maintenance and generalization; the process goal without feedback condition resulted in some benefits compared with the product and general goal conditions. Self-efficacy was highly predictive of writing skill and strategy use. Suggestions for future research and implications for classroom practice are discussed."

"This pilot project focused on improving teachers’ understanding and use of effective feedback. Participating teachers tried to incorporate feedback into their lessons to help pupils understand their learning goals and become able to develop strategies to reach them. The project employed a cyclical action research design, through which teachers reviewed academic literature on effective feedback before developing ways to apply it in the classroom. The project took place over one school year and involved nine treatment and five comparator schools in the London Borough of Bexley. All pupils in Years 2-6 took part in the study. Existing international research suggests that improving the quality of feedback in the classroom has the potential to improve learning significantly. However, studies also highlight the difficulties in improving feedback in practice, and there are few clear examples of how to improve feedback in English schools. This project sought to develop a way of improving feedback led by schools. The pilot evaluation had three aims. First, to assess the feasibility and promise of an approach to improving feedback which required schools to review, understand and apply research findings, including academic papers. Second, to provide formative recommendations that could be used to improve the approach in the future. Third, to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the approach’s impact on academic attainment that could be used to inform any future trial. The approach is feasible and there are some indications of promise. All nine schools completed the action research programme and at the end of the year many staff were receptive and enthusiastic about the approach. A number of good lessons with clear use of feedback strategies were observed. However, in common with existing studies on feedback, there was wide variation in the way that strategies to improve feedback were used. The estimated impact findings showed no difference between the intervention schools and the other primary schools in Bexley in terms of annual progress towards Level 4 at Key Stage 2 or in terms of value-added progress scores. However, due to the non-random nature of the comparison and the small number of schools involved it is difficult to draw conclusions with this. The results should not be confused with those of a full trial. Pupils eligible for free school meals made more progress in participating schools than in comparison schools. However, these findings are based on much smaller numbers and so even greater caution is required."
"Communication can be conceptualized as consisting of substantive knowledge, enabling skills, and procedural rule knowledge. Deficits in any of these components can cause communications to go awry. Much recent research has focused on developmental differences in procedural rule knowledge. This study examined the child’s acquisition of the difference rule (an informative message must distinguish referent from nonreferent). First graders evaluated the performance of a speaker doll and a listener doll engaged in a referential communication game (criticism task). Children received difference rule feedback on their evaluations on each trial. Training transferred to novel speaking, listening, and criticism tasks presented 1 week after training. Discussion focuses on applied and theoretical implications for the development of communication."
"Embedding Formative Assessment (EFA) is a whole-school professional development programme aiming to embed the use of effective formative assessment strategies. Dylan Wiliam and Siobhan Leahy, who are experts in formative assessment, designed the intervention and associated materials. The Schools, Students and Teachers network (SSAT), an independent membership organisation, delivered the project. Schools received detailed resource packs to run monthly workshops known as Teacher Learning Communities (TLCs). Each TLC was expected to last 75–90 minutes. All teaching staff were involved and split into groups comprising 8–14 people. TLC agendas and materials focused on five key formative assessment strategies: ‘clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions’; ‘engineering effective classroom discussions and activities’; ‘providing feedback that moves learning forward’; ‘activating learners as instructional resources for one another’; and ‘activating learners as owners of their own learning’. Within each of these high-level concepts, the TLC handouts introduced multiple formative assessment techniques for teachers to consider. In-between workshop sessions, teachers were expected to conduct peer lesson observations and provide feedback to each other. Each school appointed a lead teacher who attended an initial training day and received ongoing implementation support from an SSAT Lead Practitioner. This included a mixture of visits, phone calls, e-mails, and access to an online community. The project was a randomised controlled trial. It was an effectiveness trial, which tested whether the intervention worked under everyday conditions in a large number of schools. One hundred and forty secondary schools participated during the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 academic years. The primary outcome was Attainment 8 GCSE scores for the 25,393 pupils who were in Year 10 (aged 14–15) at the start of the trial. The process evaluation involved a combination of methods, including interviews, focus groups, surveys of intervention and control schools, and observations of the launch day, some TLCs, and the celebration day."
"The effects of teacher comments, type of task, student performance, and gender on the continuing motivation of 424 fifth- and sixth-grade pupils was studied. Results are discussed in terms of the relationship between continuing motivation and student perceptions of their own competence. "
"The effectiveness of a Keller and Bloom mastery learning program for high school science students was examined by comparing remediation strategies of both programs and that of a traditional strategy. The data gathered in the experiment in chemistry were from a pre- and post-achievement test. Cognitive achievement was statistically different (p < .025). Additional analysis revealed the greatest difference was between a Bloom and a traditional strategy. Gain score analyses failed to produce any significant differences. A Chi-square analysis of the number of objectives achieved produced significant values of .004 and .034, respectively, for the Keller and Bloom groups over the traditional group."
"A computer‐assisted instruction (CAI) system can provide detailed and immediate feedback following every student response. Two such procedures, labelled ‘active’ and ‘passive’ were designed for helping children to multiply two‐ and three‐digit numbers by one‐digit numbers. The active feedback procedure required an overt response to be given to each element in the procedure for computing the answer. The ‘passive’ procedure merely printed a feedback message. Two experiments are described which had treatment conditions of (i) no feedback, (ii) passive, and (iii) active feedback. As well as on‐line performances being recorded in detail by the computer, pre‐and post‐tests were given. Substantial gains on pre‐and post‐tests were recorded for the feedback groups, and a regression analysis showed that greatest effects were with pupils whose initial level of achievement was low. Overall differences between the two feedback groups did not reach significance. Finally, a simple model to account for multiplication performance is proposed."

"The major purpose of the research was to develop a group instruction method which is as effective as a one-to-one tutorial method, and, to determine the extent to which cognitive and affective outcomes of learning are affected by the instructional conditions provided to students. Three different group instructional conditions were used in the studies: (a) enhanced cues, participation, reinforcement, and feedback-corrective procedure, a maximal group instruction, (b) conventional group instruction, a minimal quality which is not equally adaptive to individual needs of most students, and (3) mastery learning, a quality which lies between the two extremes and uses the feedback-corrective procedure. Two studies were conducted in two different content areas and two grade levels. The results of the two studies indicate that the achievement students attain, the attitudes they acquire toward themselves as learners, and toward various aspects of school learning as well as the relations between prior and subsequent achievement are strongly determined by the instructional conditions provided to students. Seventy-four percent of students under maximal group instruction and 57 percent of the students under mastery learning conditions attained the level of final achievement reached only by the top 17 percent of the students under conventional instruction. Under maximal group instruction 69 percent of the students reached the mastery criterion (80 percent) on higher mental processes in comparison to 57 percent in the mastery learning and only 8 percent in the conventional groups. Large differences were also obtained on lower mental processes. The average student in the maximal group instruction was above 96 percent of the students in the conventional groups. In the enhanced CPR plus mastery learning and mastery learning groups the relation between prior and final achievement was very weak (about 8 percent common variance) however, under conventional conditions the relations remained strong (about 60 percent common variance). The effects of the instructional conditions on selected affective outcomes were also evident in the alteration of attitudes over the course of the study. Students under maximal group instruction became on the average, 22 percent more positive toward themselves as learners, the subject matter, teacher and school than were students under conventional instruction. The former were also more internal in taking responsibility for their learning outcomes. The mastery learning group advantage over the conventional group averaged 12 percent at the end of the study."

Students were randomly assigned to study an instructional program by constructed responding or by reading. Level of prior attainment was ascertained by pretest scores. Interaction was found between prior achievement and instructional support. Constructed responding was especially beneficial for students with low pretest scores. (BJG)
"Students' macroprocessing of instruction was studied in a learning situation which used adjunct questions. The subjects were offered various macroprocessing options while reading a passage on data processing and computer programming. Each sentence appeared on a computer CRT screen one at a time. The options included: (1) review any sentence or sentences; (2) preview any sentence or sentences; (3) consult an alternative text written in an easier vocabulary; (4) review the alternate text; (5) preview the alternate text; (6) take notes; (7) review the notes; (8) view an outline of the 49-paragraph presentation; or (9) view and select from a menu of options. Tests of reading, worry, test anxiety, and study skills were administered. Three groups were assigned: only reading the text; reading and responding to adjunct questions after each screen; or reading, answering questions, and receiving feedback. The computer system monitored which options were selected, as well as the frequency and time requirements. The results suggested that students did not select options which optimized individual achievement; in fact, they may not have known which macroprocesses to use to improve learning."
The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the Multi-Ethnic Information Feedback System (MIFS) on the reading and arithmetic achievement of fifth grade pupils. Consisting of an objective referenced test-item and a computer feedback system MIFS enabled teachers to continually measure student performance and evaluate the effectiveness of their own instruction. It was expected that these activities would influence student achievement. The results of the data analysis indicated that the program significantly increased reading and arithmetic achievement.
"This study explored the effect of formative assessment on student achievement in science. Research in science education has shown that students enter science classrooms with previously formed explanatory models of the natural world; these naive ""mental models"" have a substantial influence on their learning of scientific conceptions (e.g. Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992). In general, conceptual change describes the pathway from pre-instructional or prior conceptions to a post-instructional or desired conception (e.g. Duit, 1999; Posner, Strike, Hewson, & Gertzog; 1982). Conceptual change involves a fundamental restructuring of a network of concepts rather than fitting new concepts into an existing conceptual network or structure (National Research Council, 2007). Research has shown that conceptual change is difficult to promote; for example, students may accumulate multiple conceptions over the course of instruction, including both new misconceptions and more scientifically-sound conceptions. Hellden and Solomon (2004) found that although students tended to evoke the same, less-scientific conceptions over time, they could produce more scientifically-sound conceptions during interviews with appropriate prompting; thus, students undergo conceptual accumulation rather than conceptual change. Students can recall scientifically-sound conceptions they have learned and may use them to reason, but they do so in partnership or hybridization with their less-scientific prior conceptions (Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992). Student achievement in science may be conceptualized as composed of four different but overlapping types of knowledge - declarative (knowing that), procedural (knowing how to), schematic (knowing why), and strategic (knowing how knowledge, applies to particular situation and monitoring progress). These four types of knowledge are distinguishable in theory, and may be assessed by different types of measures (Li, 2001; Ayala, Shavelson, Yin, & Schultz, 2002; Shavelson et al, 2008). As such, it is important to identify achievement goals according to different types of knowledge students are expected to gain and to focus instruction and assessment properly - conceptual change focuses on developing increasingly more scientifically-sound schematic knowledge, whereas gains in declarative or procedural knowledge may be more closely related to conceptual accumulation because it does not involve dramatic changes in schematic understanding. Formative assessment, which focuses on providing immediate feedback by acting upon student understanding during the course of instruction, and conceptual change have both been linked to increased student achievement (e.g. Black & Wiliam, 1998; Wang, Haertel & Walberg, 1993). Formative assessment is an instructional strategy that helps teachers to assess students' current understanding, identify the gap between current understanding and expected understanding, and provide immediate and useful feedback to students on how to close the gap. Formative assessment ranges from formal (e.g. embedded, planned-for interactions between teacher and entire class) to informal (e.g. on-the-fly interactions between teacher and class or student). In this study, the links between formative assessment and conceptual accumulation and conceptual change were explored. Specifically, this study asked: (1) Does formative assessment promote conceptual accumulation, and (2) Does formative assessment promote conceptual change? It was hypothesized that conceptual change-focused formative assessment would foster conceptual change, in addition to supporting conceptual accumulation. It was further hypothesized that all students will show gains in conceptual accumulation as indicated by measures of declarative and procedural knowledge, but that students exposed to conceptual change-focused formative assessment would also show gains in conceptual change as indicated by measures of schematic knowledge or mental models. To research the effect of formative assessment on conceptual accumulation and conceptual change, a small randomized experiment involving 102 middle school students was conducted. In Phase I of the study, 52 6th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group; in Phase II of this study, 50 7th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Both the control and experimental groups in both phases were taught about sinking and floating by the same teacher (the author) with identical curriculum materials and activities. In addition, the experimental group received three sets of embedded formative assessments focused on conceptual change around the topic of why things sink and float during the course of instruction. In Phase I of this study, both groups were kept at the same pace through the entire sequence of investigations. The control condition spent more time on some of the more critical FAST lessons, gathering additional data to support the theories the curriculum expected they would develop at a particular juncture but not receiving structured experiences aimed at addressing misconceptions. In Phase II, students in the control condition spent roughly the same time on each FAST lesson as those in the experimental condition (e.g. they finished the sequence of activities earlier because they did not have class sessions devoted to the RLs inserted at critical junctures) but participated in the formal assessments as a block of activities after they finished the FAST investigations and posttest measures. In other words, in addition to replicating Phase I, Phase II included a Reflective Lesson section for the control group after the end of the experiment proper, followed by a post-posttest. Overall, it was found that embedding conceptual change-focused formative assessments in the FAST curriculum significantly influenced conceptual change. It was also found that all students experienced significant gains in terms of their conceptual accumulation, regardless of exposure to the formative assessments. This study connected two previously isolated but theoretically linked educational frameworks: conceptual change and formative assessment. It was found that formative assessments can be used to promote conceptual change. It was also found that conceptual change is different than conceptual accumulation, in that students who show gains on measures of declarative and procedural knowledge do not necessarily show gains on measures of schematic knowledge. This implies that if a goal of science instruction is to support student development of scientifically-sound conceptions in addition to acquisition of facts and skills, then conceptual change must be specifically targeted via instructional strategies such as embedded formative assessment."
"Despite calls for reform, little has changed in how teachers teach or test over the past few decades. Teacher-made assessments, in particular, have been underutilized for reforming classroom practice. Yet research has shown that staff development that emphasizes teacher collaboration around formative assessment can be effective in changing teaching practices and improving student learning. This study implemented and evaluated a pilot effort for middle school mathematics teachers along these lines called Formative Assessment with Collaborative Teaming and Support (FACTS). The research focused on whether FACTS led to improved student achievement and whether it changed teacher beliefs and practices. Eleven middle school math teachers volunteered to participate, eight using the FACTS intervention and three acting as an outside control group. The study included 31 classroom sections and 843 students. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used in the analysis. Benchmark tests were given to students three times during the first trimester of a school year. Gain scores, covariance analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling were used to measure treatment effects. Second, participating teachers were surveyed at the beginning and end of the intervention to measure changes in their beliefs and practices. Survey results were compared to national outcomes on similar questions, and treatment groups and individual teachers were compared in terms of pre- to post-intervention changes. Finally, qualitative data gathered during collaboration meetings was combined with post-intervention interviews to help verify results and add context to the study. Overall, the findings for the use of the FACTS intervention were mixed. There was no significant difference in student achievement growth across the treatment groups, indicating that FACTS did not significantly impact student learning. Yet changes in teacher beliefs and practices were found, as indicated by positive effect sizes on measures of assessment beliefs and practices, instructional beliefs, instructional practices, data use, and teacher-to-teacher interaction. Limitations of this study, including the short intervention time frame and decentralized curriculum implementation schedules, may have contributed to the mixed results."
"A number of studies on cooperative teaching have shown favorable effects on academic achievement. This may be due to better information processing: Low achievers get more explanation, and high achievers have to verbalize the explanation. It may also be due to students' motivation: Students exert peer pressure for better performance. In a field experiment among third-grade students, traditional spelling instruction was compared with two different forms of cooperative classroom instruction, one with individual feedback and one with shared feedback. Cooperative methods had positive effects on spelling achievement and on students' effort as rated by their teachers. Shared feedback did not produce better spelling than did individual feedback."
"Formative assessment feedback is increasingly viewed as essential to learning. Yet, existing studies on feedback have focused heavily on knowledge of results (KR) feedback rather than information-rich formative assessment feedback that is more commonly used to encourage and guide learning. This study was designed to investigate the effects of information-rich formative assessment feedback on performance and motivation of middle school science students. Using a within subjects crossover design, treatment students received written formative assessment feedback on all homework and class-work assignments. Control students received completion scores for their work but no feedback. Dependent measures included two multiple-choice unit tests and a multipart motivation survey which assessed self-efficacy, goal orientation, affective responses, and preferences regarding feedback. Results indicated effects sizes of .7 for low achievers and .4 for middle level achievers on the performance measure as a result of the feedback intervention. These students also experienced a significant increase in self-efficacy. High achievers experienced reduced performance following the feedback intervention with an effect size of -.7. Survey analysis revealed no improvement in motivation-related variables for high achievers."
"Effective assessment of student achievement has important implications for monitoring student progress and implementing instructional changes. Two procedures that have been commonly used in assessing student achievement are mastery learning and the general outcome model (curriculum-based measurement). Mastery learning procedures monitor progress by assessing mastery on small, successive units of curricula. The general outcome model utilizes the entire year's curricula to assess progress toward the year end goal. Although both methods measure student achievement using current curricula, the general outcome model has been found to be more effective in monitoring student progress to make needed curricular changes. This study compared two procedures utilizing participants enrolled in four second grade classrooms in a midwestern elementary school. Two of the classrooms utilized the Scott Foresman spelling curricula using a variation of mastery learning. The other two classrooms followed that curriculum and also used curriculum-based measurement procedures to monitor progress. The Test of Written Spelling was administered to all participants to assess spelling achievement at the beginning, middle and end of the study. The performance of the two groups was compared on teachers' weekly and quarterly grades, and the Test of Written Spelling. The Otis-Lennon School Ability Test was used to control for effects of ability. Results were inconclusive, suggesting the need for further research in the areas of a) achievement of regular education students when CBM procedures are utilized, b) differences between CBM and other methods of assessment and c) minimizing teacher time involved in implementing CBM procedures."
"Abstract: This study describes an intelligent tutoring system to improve reading literacy skills called TuinLEC and it presents the results of its application to a group of sixth grade students. TuinLEC adopts the reading literacy theoretical framework of PISA (Program for International Students Assessment, OECD, 2009). TuinLEC includes eight lessons distributed in two phases, one for modeling and guided practice, and the second for independent practice. TuinLEC interacts with every student and it provides help and feedback for the task in a game-like environment. Half of the students were taught with TuinLEC, whereas the other half served as the control group. Children in both groups were paired according to reading comprehension scores. We measured students’ reading literacy skills after intervention, which showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group. Students who were taught with TuinLEC were also given a questionnaire measuring satisfaction, usability, and self-efficacy; TuinLEC scored positively in all these measurements. We discuss how TuinLEC can improve the reading literacy skills of sixth-graders as well as the contribution of intelligent tutoring systems to instructional interventions. © 2014 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje."
"Summary Street is educational software based on latent semantic analysis (LSA), a computer method for representing the content of texts. The classroom trial described here demonstrates the power of LSA to support an educational goal by providing automatic feedback on the content of students' summaries. Summary Street provides this feedback in an easy-to-grasp, graphic display that helps students to improve their writing across multiple cycles of writing and revision on their own before receiving a teacher's final evaluation. The software thus has the potential to provide students with extensive writing practice without increasing the teacher's workload. In classroom trials 6th-grade students not only wrote better summaries when receiving content-based feedback from Summary Street, but also spent more than twice as long engaged in the writing task. Specifically, their summaries were characterized by a more balanced coverage of the content than summaries composed without this feedback. Greater improvement in content scores was observed with texts that were difficult to summarize. Classroom implementation of Summary Street is discussed, including suggestions for instructional activities beyond summary writing."
"Used a 3 * 2 * 2 factorial design with factors of feedback specificity (total, partial, or none), instructional strategy (mastery or nonmastery), and mental ability (high and low scores on Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test). 116 male high school students were Ss for the 5-wk study. The mastery strategy was superior in terms of immediate and delayed achievement, but Ss required 50% more time to complete instructions with no difference in attitude. Partial item feedback for unit tests was superior on both immediate achievement and attitude with no difference in retention. A mastery strategy with partial item feedback appears most desirable when time trade-off is justifiable."
"This Learner Response System (LRS) intervention involves the use of electronic handheld devices that allow teachers and pupils to provide immediate feedback during lessons. For example, pupils can respond to a question using the device and responses are immediately visible to the teacher, or they can work through problems on the device at their own pace with answers provided as they go. The aim is to improve outcomes by increasing the speed and quality of classroom feedback. A team from Edge Hill University developed the intervention and trained teachers to deliver it to pupils in Years 5 and 6 in primary schools with higher than average proportions of children ever eligible for free school meals. The devices were to be used in at least three lessons a week for between 25 and 32 weeks each year. The intervention ran from June 2014 to June 2016. One cohort of pupils used the LRS for two school years (‘cohort B’), and one cohort for only one school year (‘cohort A’). A cluster randomised controlled trial was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention on Year 6 maths and reading outcomes. Around 6,500 pupils in 97 schools took part. The accompanying process evaluation involved classroom observations, teacher interviews, and focus groups with pupils. The project was funded as part of the EEF Digital Technology funding round in collaboration with the Nominet Trust."
"Technologies and their effectiveness are impacted by how well they are implemented. A large scale randomized controlled trial was conducted to study the efficacy of a web-based intelligent tutoring system to deliver the structure strategy to improve content area reading comprehension. We present our theory of change focusing on the theoretical framework: structure strategy, delivery approach of web-based intelligent tutoring systems, and contextual conditions for successful adoption of the tool with fidelity. Results from the optimal implementation schools show statistically significantly better performance by ITSS classrooms compared to their control counterparts with moderate to large effect sizes. Conditions for implementing technology-based interventions with fidelity in schools are discussed. "
"Abstract: This article reports on a large scale randomized controlled trial to study the efficacy of a web-based intelligent tutoring system for the structure strategy designed to improve content area reading comprehension. The research was conducted with 128 fifth-grade classrooms within 12 school districts in rural and suburban settings. Classrooms within each school were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. The intervention group used the intelligent web-based tutoring system for the structure strategy (ITSS) for 30 to 45 min each week as a partial substitute for the language arts curriculum for the entire school year. The structure strategy teaches students how to read and comprehend expository texts by identifying the text structure and creating strategic mental representations of the text. The web-based tutoring system delivered the structure strategy training with modeling, practice tasks, assessment, and feedback. The control classrooms used the school's language arts curriculum for the full language-arts time. Results show that the ITSS delivered structure strategy training improved reading comprehension measured by a standardized test and researcher designed measures. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Reading comprehension in the content areas is a challenge for many middle grade students. Text structure-based instruction has yielded positive outcomes in reading comprehension at all grade levels in small and large studies. The text structure strategy delivered via the web, called Intelligent Tutoring System for the Text Structure Strategy (ITSS), has proven successful in large-scale studies at 4th and 5th grades and a smaller study at 7th grade. Text structure-based instruction focuses on selection and encoding of strategic memory. This strategic memory proves to be an effective springboard for many comprehension-based activities such as summarizing, inferring, elaborating, and applying. This was the first large-scale randomized controlled efficacy study on the web-based delivery of the text structure strategy to 7th-grade students. 108 classrooms from rural and suburban schools were randomly assigned to ITSS or control and pretests and posttests were administered at the beginning and end of the school year. Multilevel data analyses were conducted on standardized and researcher designed measures of reading comprehension. Results showed that ITSS classrooms outperformed the control classrooms on all measures with the highest effects reported for number of ideas included in the main idea. Results have practical implications for classroom practices. © 2017 American Psychological Association."
"While it is generally acknowledged that increased use of formative assessment (or assessment for learning) leads to higher quality learning, it is often claimed that the pressure in schools to improve the results achieved by students in externally‐set tests and examinations precludes its use. This paper reports on the achievement of secondary school students who worked in classrooms where teachers made time to develop formative assessment strategies. A total of 24 teachers (2 science and 2 mathematics teachers, in each of six schools in two LEAs) were supported over a six‐month period in exploring and planning their approach to formative assessment, and then, beginning in September 1999, the teachers put these plans into action with selected classes. In order to compute effect sizes, a measure of prior attainment and at least one comparison group was established for each class (typically either an equivalent class taught in the previous year by the same teacher, or a parallel class taught by another teacher). The mean effect size in favour of the intervention was 0.32."
"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of teacher-guided direct revision instruction and small group peer generated revision on the quality of eighth grade students ' persuasive essays. Teacher directed revision instruction was direct instruction by the teacher in the use of additions, deletions, substitutions and rearrangements and in the use of the compare, diagnose, operate (CDO) procedure. Small-group peer generated revision included researcher organized small-group cooperative learning activities during which peers read, responded to, and made suggestions for changes to improve essay drafts. Control group subjects were given instruction in persuasive writing, were asked to respond to the persuasive writing prompt, and were told to revise their essays. This study was a pretest, posttest, control group design utilizing six, intact, average reading/language arts class groups, 134 subjects, from grade eight. The pretest was the students' first draft, and the posttest was a final draft. The six classes participating in the study included two classes in each of three different schools with the research and control group schools being randomly assigned. The duration of the treatment was for six consecutive class periods. As a final activity, all students were given 30 minutes to write a final draft. The results of the study indicated that the Direct Instruction Group and the Small-Group students were rated significantly higher for quality (p < .05) than were the students in the Control Group (only directions to revise). All groups utilized a variety of revision levels, but results indicated significant correlations between quality and surface level revisions (p < .001), between quality and lexical level revisions (p < .01), and between quality and sentence level revisions (p < .01)."
"The purpose of this study was to determine what kind of feedback would be most effective in helping students improve their writing and in what manner it should be provided. Feedback was provided on a specific writing task, the short autobiographical narrative. Improvement was measured by scales of the three variables: completeness, development, and length. Three conditions of feedback were provided: quantitative positive student self-feedback through the feedback form, quantitative positive feedback through teacher assessment using the same form, and teacher corrective feedback through written final comments based on the criteria of the feedback form. A control group, no feedback, was included. Subjects were 35 sixth grade students, in two classrooms, randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups. Changes were measured by pre- and posttest changes in narratives. All experimental conditions produced significant changes compared with the control. There is some evidence that self-evaluation yields greater gains than teacher evaluation, however, further research is necessary to confirm these conclusions."

"Elementary school pupils identified as being a year or more behind in reading achievement and who were observed as spending low percentages of time-on-task-were selected for participation in a short-term, highly structured program designed to increase task oriented behavior. Two different groups of approximately ten children each participated in each of three separate eight-week intervention phases. For each phase, a comparison group of approximately ten children remained in the regular classroom. Following the intervention, participating pupils were found to spend significantly more time-on-task and to achieve at a significantly higher level in reading than their comparison counterparts. These advantages in reading achievement performance were maintained over a period of four months after their return to regular classrooms on a full-time basis."
"This study connected research on formative assessment, motivation, and conceptual change. In particular, it examined three research questions: (1) Can formative assessment improve students' motivational beliefs? (2) Can formative assessment improve students' achievement in science and bring about conceptual change? and (3) Are students' science achievement and conceptual change correlated with their motivational beliefs? Formative assessment in this study refers to assessments embedded in an inquiry-based curriculum. To answer those questions, a randomized experiment was conducted. One thousand and two 6th or 7th graders of 12 teachers in 12 different schools in six states participated in the study. The 12 teachers were matched in pairs and randomly assigned to the experimental and control group. The experimental group employed embedded formative assessments while teaching a science curriculum unit and the control group taught the same unit without formative assessments. All the students were given a motivation survey and one or more achievement tests at pre- and posttest. By comparing the experimental and control students' motivation and achievement scores at pretest and posttest, I examined whether the formative assessment treatment affected students' motivation, learning, and conceptual change. By correlating students' posttest motivation, achievement as well as conceptual change scores, I examined whether students' motivation was related to their achievement and conceptual change. Analyses indicated that, the embedded assessments used by the experimental group did not significantly influence students' motivation, achievement, or conceptual change compared to students in the control group. Most motivation beliefs were correlated with students' achievement in a way similar to what has been reported in the literature. They were not correlated with students' conceptual change scores as hypothesized. Teachers, as well as some contextual factors associated with teachers, were extremely influential on students' motivation, achievement, and conceptual change; teacher effects overshadowed the treatment effect. This study revealed many of the challenges and problems teachers, researchers and randomized experiments are likely to encounter. It also highlighted the difficulty and importance of high-fidelity formative assessment implementation. Finally, it suggested that a cognitive approach in studying conceptual change still has great value to further research."
"The purpose of this study was to explore whether fourth graders could enhance their writing performance by learning to use the criteria in a rubric to assess their own work. Over a four-week period, 304 students were exposed to contrasting writing strategies that focused on three classroom environmental variables: self-assessment with peer and teacher input, multiple practices with teacher written feedback only, and experience in converting the written product into a speech. The writing instruction strategies under study replaced the regular classroom writing instruction two days a week for one-hour periods each day for four weeks. The students were assessed with pre- and posttests in the week prior to and following the intervention, responding to writing prompts similar in genre to the prompts used in the Ne w Jersey state testing program (The Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, ESPA) . A n analysis of covariance (ANCOYA) on posttest results of all three groups showeed a significant improvement in writing F (3,271) = 31.66, p < .05. However, the self-assessment group performed significantly better than comparison groups suggesting that when fourth graders know the criteria by which they are assessed, they can learn to use that knowledge to enhance their own writing. Insights from this study may be useful to teachers caught in the dilemma facing today's educators: how to improve student writing."
"Studied the effects of 3 degrees of structuring in a teacher's demonstration upon rule learning by 36 6- and 8-yr-olds. Ss were evenly divided between males and females. After pretesting on a conceptual sorting task, Ss were exposed to a modeling sequence under high, medium, or low degrees of structure. Half of the Ss were permitted to imitate the model's actions. All were given a transfer test consisting of new items. Results reveal that 6-yr-olds were disproportionately handicapped when the demonstration was only partially structured. Imitation failed to influence cluster rule learning. Results are discussed in terms of a social learning conception of teaching."
