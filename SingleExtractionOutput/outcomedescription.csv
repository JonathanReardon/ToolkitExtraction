"Posttest of achievement  The posttest of achievement was designed to measure virtually everything presented in the lessons, even if it were only peripherally relevant, rather than to sample the lesson content. It was felt that small lapses in attention due to treatment differences would be more Ukely to be detected where all the pieces of information covered in the lessons had a corresponding posttest item. Also, with every lesson question having a corresponding posttest item, the performance of the pupils on the posttest items relevant to the questions they had been asked during the lessons could be compared with their performance on the posttest items not relevant to the questions they had been asked during the lessons. To obtain the desired content coverage, constructed response and true/false items were used in preference to multiple-choice items which are rather lengthy per unit of information obtained. The posttest of achievement contained 222 items and gave a content coverage which could not have been obtained in less than three or four hours of testing using multiple-choice items. As a check on the reliability of the posttest of achievement, a split-half reliability coefficient, corrected by the Spearman-Brown formula, was calculated. The resulting figure, based on a random sample of 114 papers, was .92 which is considered very satisfactory since the pupils in the study were of a restricted range of ability and the test was untimed.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

General merit includes four factors  ideas, organization, wording, and flavor, while mechanics is broken down into usage, punctuation, spelling, and handwriting. Two raters score each of the eight factors on a 5-point scale, based upon the description of high, medium, and low papers.","Evaluative and Directive Phrases, a strategy developed by Bereiter and Scar- damalia (1982), provides a series of phrases to describe sentence content and to suggest revision tactics.

"The Test of Word Reading Efficiency is a brief reading measure containing two subtests  Sight Word Efficiency and Phonemic Decoding Efficiency. The Sight Word Efficiency subtest measures the student’s accuracy in reading real words, and the Phonemic Decoding Efficiency subtest measures the student’s accuracy with pronounceable non-words. Raw scores for each subtest are calculated based on the number of words read correctly for each subtest. Raw scores are then converted into standard scores for both subtests (M = 100, SD = 15) and the Total Word Reading Efficiency standard score (M = 100, SD = 15).","The Woodcock Johnson Test of Achievement-Third Edition (Woodcock, McGrew & Mather, 2001) is a standardized, norm-referenced test designed to measure children’s achievement in the areas of reading, mathematics and writing.

The Spelling subtest examined a student’s ability to correctly write orally presented words.
