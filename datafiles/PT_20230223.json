In reciprocal peer tutoring, learners alternate between the role of tutor and tutee. The common characteristic is that learners take on responsibility for aspects of teaching and for evaluating their success. Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\r\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools).

A total of 380 students enrolled in grades 7th and 8th participated in the study. Two peer tutoring sessions took place during each week (10 weeks). Interactions between peers lasted 20 to 25 minutes for each session. The typology of tutoring was fixed and same-age. A pretest posttest with control group design was used. Statistical significant improvements were reported in the academic achievement variable after the implementation of the peer tutoring program for 7th and 8th grade courses separately and altogether. Over 87% of the students in the experimental group improved their marks. The overall effect size for the experience was reported to be medium (Hedge’s g = 0.48). The main conclusion of this study is that fixed and same-age peer tutoring in algebra may be very beneficial for middle school students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Alegre Francisco ; Moliner Lidon ; Maroto Ana ; Lorenzo-Valentin Gil ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00220671.2019.1693947","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Alegre Francisco, Moliner Lidon, Maroto Ana, and Lorenzo-Valentin Gil (2019) Peer tutoring in algebra: A study in middle school.

The pedagogies explored included the use of manipulatives and peer learning. The thesis reports an investigation using a factorial design of the effects of incorporating peer and resource-led learning into teacher pedagogies.\\r\\nIt examined the effects of using peer tutoring and manipulatives, both separately and together, on the mathematical education of fourth grade students (aged 10 and 11) in elementary schools in AlAhsa city in Saudi Arabia, with regard to (a) attainment in mathematics, (b) attitudes towards learning mathematics, (c) attitudes towards learning partners and (d) the students’ social relationships. Twenty-four classes were randomly chosen and assigned to different groups. One control group of six classes was taught as usual, and six classes were assigned to each of three experimental groups: that is, six each to the manipulatives group, the peer tutoring group and the group using peer tutoring and manipulatives together. Each experimental group undertook a 12-week programme in the fractions and decimals sections of the fourth grade elementary school mathematics curriculum. The research methods and materials were initially developed during a pilot study involving 8 classes of fourth grade students (aged 10 and 11) in elementary schools in AlAhsa city.\\r\\nThe results of this RCT suggested that the use of peer tutoring and manipulatives, separately and together, significantly affected the mathematical education of those students regarding their attainment, attitudes towards learning mathematics, attitudes towards their learning partners and social relationships. The results also showed that the improvement in the students’ social relationships predicted their attainment scores.\\r\\nSuggestions for further research into the effects of using peer tutoring and manipulatives, both separately and together, on mathematical education in elementary schools, are also made.","Comments":"MDE: There are 4 arms in this study: a) peer tutoring PT, b) manipulatives M, c) PT+M, d) control.

Then get a fixed effect of these two effect sizes using the fixed effect Excel formula (and add as overall Toolkit primary outcome).","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Aleid Mohammed Abdulaziz E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aleid Mohammed Abdulaziz E (2015) Using peer tutoring and manipulatives to improve mathematics education in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023548,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12172939,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":872563,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Peer tutoring method was applied to observe its special effects on\nthe success and approach of Learners in the subject of English.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Alwi etal_2016.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":872563,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"The problem of study is Impact of Peer Tutoring on development\nof reading skill of kids in primary school of Karachi.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Alwi etal_2016.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":872563,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"cross age peer tutoring[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Alwi etal_2016.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":872563,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"Strategies to Build Reading Fluency\n?

The determinations of the study were to measure the success of the learners in the subject of English before the testing, to expose the experimental group to cross age peer tutoring and the control group to conventional teaching to associate the change in the achievement of students participating in peer tutorials and learners who did not contribute in Peer tutoring. The exercise of peer tutoring across many disciplines is increasing to help in appealing learners for active learning process. It is kindly accepted that educational results. Peer shows a special role in kids’ development in accumulation to parents and instructors. However, the larger variability, autonomy and likeness of peer associations offers children the opportunity for a new kind of relational investigation and assessment. A sample of 137 students were taken from one by convince random sampling method selected school of low economic people resident area of Karachi orangi town Karachi. The design of the experimental study was “Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Groups Design” which is a form of Quasi-Experimental designs. 52 students from class II and III nominated institute were pretested complete a self-developed accomplishment exam. On the basis of pre- test results and the willingness of the students, paid of students were made on both classes. Students were paired as learning partners during the reading sessions. To determine the implication of the tutoring interference through evaluation of pre- and post-test success of experimental and control groups, descriptive statistics and ANOVA (analysis of Variance with Tukey Ba,b) were used.The Present research result was noted that cross-age tutoring—pairing students in grades II and III – was more positive effect on reading attitudes of the students and the most important gain for students as a result of the research was the self-esteem they developed from the self-worth they experienced. They had a great feeling of being needed.","Comments":"ESDE: Compare same age (SA) vs control, then cross age (CA) vs control.

Four secondary schools out of eight secondary schools was randomly selected, and all the 145 SS1 students offering Home Economics in these four schools were selected and assigned to experimental and control groups. One research question and one hypothesis guided the study. Data on student’s achievement was collected using Home Economics achievement test (HAT). The research question was answered using mean t-test statistics. The results indicated that students taught Home Economics using peer tutoring instructional methods achieved higher than those taught using lecture method, it was recommended that peer tutoring should be used in teaching Home Economics in secondary schools to enhance student’s achievement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Amaka Okoye Assumpta; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.5901/AJIS.2013.V2N5P193","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Amaka Okoye Assumpta (2013) Effect of peer tutoring method on students academic achievement in home economics.

efforts to develop education which related to quality of education were overall implemented by the government to enhance quality of education. The implementation of compatible method was an effort to improve learning achievement and accomplish learning goals. Peer tutoring is a group of students who have completed learning material then provide assistance for others who got difficulty in understanding the material. From the research result were obtained, (1) Sig. 0,011 = Ho was rejected means there was difference in students learning result in mathematic lesson by using peer tutoring method compare with conventional learning method; (2) Sig. 0,002 = Ho was rejected means there was difference in problem solving communication skill in mathematic lesson by using peer tutoring method compare with conventional learning method; (3) Sig. 0,043 = Ho was rejected means there was difference in problem solving comprehension skill in mathematic lesson by using peer tutoring method compare with conventional learning method. From the data, it can be concluded that students learning result using peer tutoring method was more effective. It was because, this method demanded students to be more active in learning process either individual or overall.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Andriana Teguh Rizki; Sabandar Jozua ; Syaban Mumun ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"http://doi.org/10.22460/jiml.v1i4.p345-349","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Andriana Teguh Rizki, Sabandar Jozua, and Syaban Mumun (2018) The influence of peer tutoring model on the problem-solving understanding and communication skills of eight grade junior high school students.

However, peer tutoring approach remains an underutilized peer support (Bond & Castagnera 2006). This study determined the effects of peer tutoring approach in motivation, participation and academic performance of grade 8 students. Using regression discontinuity design, the respondents were non-struggling, struggling who accepted peer tutoring and struggling students who declined peer tutoring. Results showed that struggling students who accepted peer tutoring showed better participation, expertlike perceptions of junior high school science, and exam performance relative to their peers who were not attending the peer tutoring sessions. The results of this study provide evidence to teachers who want to plan targeted peer support for students who are struggling in junior high school science.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bellen Joy A; Jomoc Amalia B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.32945/ATR39110.2017","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bellen Joy A, and Jomoc Amalia B (2017) Supporting struggling grade 8 science students’ motivation, participation and performance through peer-tutoring approach.

Participants (n = 57) from the lowest 25th percentile of their sophomore class in reading were assigned randomly to peer-mediated or teacher-directed intervention. Fifteen to sixteen 25-minute intervention sessions over 12 weeks included listening passage preview, retelling, and main idea questioning. Linear regression revealed statistically significant main effects of intervention on maze selection, with both treatment groups outperforming a nonequivalent control group (ES = .69–1.00). There were no statistically significant differences on oral reading fluency or maze selection between the peer-mediated and teacher-directed groups. Participating in peer-mediated intervention and receiving more minutes of instruction were significantly associated with higher performance on the district reading assessment. Implications for allocating resources to tiered intervention in secondary schools are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bemboom Christina M; McMaster Kristen L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/LDRP.12020","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bemboom Christina M, and McMaster Kristen L (2013) A comparison of lower‐ and higher‐resourced tier 2 reading interventions for high school sophomores.

descriptive-comparative study aimed to develop session plans with learning activities for peer tutoring on quadratic equations. It involved five classes of Grade 9 students of Bantayan National High School, Tabaco City, Albay, Philippines wherein one class was randomly selected as the peer tutored group while the remaining four classes were considered the non-peer tutored groups. The peer tutoring sessions were conducted during the Independent/Cooperative Learning (ICL) period. The sources of data included the students’ reflection entries, observation notes, responses from focus group discussions, and periodic examination results. Findings showed that there were nine session plans with learning activities developed with the integration of cooperative and contextualized learning approaches. The peer tutors were able to master the lessons since they have the opportunity to study it again and revise what they have learned. They also gained more friends, boosted their confidence, and became more interested and enthusiastic in learning and teaching Mathematics together with their peer tutees. On the other hand, the peer tutees grasped the lessons because their tutor gave immediate feedback to them. They also learned how to cooperate and participate with their group to achieve their goal. It was also showed that the peer tutees were very much engaged and eager to learn during the peer tutoring. These were some of the significant learning experiences of the peer tutors and peer tutees during the conduct of peer tutoring. In terms of performance, based on the results of their periodic examination, the peer tutored group had a better performance than those non-peer tutored groups. The session plans with learning activities for peer tutoring were then concluded to give benefits in the learning experiences and enhanced the Mathematics performance of the learners.","Comments":"Please check the groups compared from Table 2\nESDE: Please compare tutored vs non-tutored A+B+C+D.

purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a supplemental peer-tutoring reading program on phonological and reading fluency skills of first graders (N = 78) who were in predominantly Hispanic Title 1 classrooms. Sixty-eight percent of the students were Hispanic, all were English speaking. Six classrooms were randomly assigned to either the peer-assisted learning strategies (PALS) program or a control condition. PALS students participated in a peer-mediated early literacy intervention three times a week for 20 weeks for a total of 30 hours. Reading fluency measures taken at fall, winter, and spring showed statistically significant differences favoring PALS on phoneme segmentation and nonsense word fluency. Additionally, results analyzed by ethnic subgroups (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) revealed a differential pattern of response to PALS intervention. Social validity questionnaires reported that teachers and students viewed PALS in a positive light.

identify the impact that Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) has on student motivation, comprehension and academic achievement. The study examined, through qualitative and quantitative analysis, the benefits that CWPT has on student success, compared to traditional teaching. The procedure compared two seventh-grade classes with similar abilities. One class was taught using traditional, teacher-led methodology, while the other class utilized a CWPT model. A pre and post-test, student survey and an observational journal were incorporated to evaluate the effectiveness of the study. The results of the study indicated that CWPT is effective in enhancing student motivation and utilizes tools that promote comprehension, which are not applicable in a traditional classroom. However, no changes in academic achievement occurred. This suggests that compared to traditional teaching, CWPT is beneficial in stimulating student motivation, but not advantageous for fostering academic growth.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Connelly Daniel J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Connelly Daniel J (2010) The extent that Classwide Peer Tutoring impacts student motivation, comprehension and academic achievement. ,  Caldwell College."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023548,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12172939,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":872571,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"This study was designed to offer a peer learning environment\nwithin which the putative communal tendencies ofAfrican American youth could\nbe capitalized on to facilitate learning an academic task[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Dill & Boykin_2000.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":872571,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"in this study, a communal learning context\nwas designed to offer a peer learning environment within which the activa-\ntion of the communal theme could be capitalized on.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Dill & Boykin_2000.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":872571,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Students assigned to the peer tutoring criterion context were seated with another peer and given one set ofmaterials.

tutoring strategies tend to use structured peer interactions and group reward contingency. This study was designed to offer a peer learning environment within which the putative communal tendencies of African American youth could be capitalized on to facilitate learning an academic task. There were 72 African American fifth-grade students (36 males, 36 females) randomly assigned to a communal learning, peer tutoring criterion, or an individual criterion context and given a text of prose to learn. Following the learning phase, students individually completed a recall task. A 3 2 between-subject ANOVA revealed that students under the communal learning context recalled significantly more text than students assigned to the peer and individual contexts. Additionally, communal beliefs were correlated with positive attitudes toward task engagement. No such positive relationships were found for individual belief. The discussion focuses on the use of cultural contexts for learning.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code for peer tutoring vs individual as Toolkit primary outcome and peer tutoring vs communal (active control) for secondary outcome.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dill Ebony M; Boykin A Wade; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0095798400026001004","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dill Ebony M, and Boykin A Wade (2000) The comparative influence of individual, peer tutoring, and communal learning contexts on the text recall of African American children.

Students said that, because they had to rely on their tutor in\nthe experiment, they hoped that the hints could be made more detailed and system-\natic. One male student said, ‘My tutor always asked me what this meant and what\nthat meant in the hints.’ Another female student complained that her tutor always\ncalled the ‘pH test paper’ the ‘hP paper.’\"\n\"From the informal interview, we knew that students in peer tutoring had a sense of\nresponsibility which drove them to prepare for the lab work. One male student in the\npeer tutoring condition said, ‘I was quite worried and thought that I might teach my\npartner in some wrong way and end up with an explosion in the lab. So I spent much\nmore time reading the instructions and hints than ever before.’\nBut talking with the students also revealed some potential problems with peer\ntutoring. The first one was the uncertainty on the part of the tutees. One female\nstudent said, ‘I felt great uncertainty about following my partner’s instructions.\nSometimes I was quite doubtful about his interpretation of the hints. I’d rather read\nthe manual and hints on my own.’ The other two students in the peer tutoring\ncondition suggested that in the future they would like to be paired with top-notch\nstudents in chemistry.\"\n\"The communication between the tutor and the tutee was\nanother problem.

aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of collaborative learning with hints and peer tutoring with hints, and individual learning with hints in chemistry laboratory education in a secondary school. A total of 96 eleventh graders participated in this study. The study has a randomized pre‐test and post‐test design with a delayed post‐test. During the four‐week intervention, students were required to carry out eight lab tasks in total. The students filled in a 17‐item self‐assessment of learning gain questionnaire on the last day. Analyses of students’ learning achievements showed that students in both the collaborative learning and peer tutoring situations outperformed those learning individually with hints. The delayed post‐test, which was administered three months later, revealed that students who had been in the peer tutoring situation outscored those in the collaborative learning situation. Student self‐assessment questionnaires on learning gain provided further details in this regard.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code for peer tutoring vs individual as Toolkit primary outcome and peer tutoring vs collaborative (active control) for secondary outcome","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ding Ning ; Harskamp Egbert G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09500693.2010.498842","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ding Ning, and Harskamp Egbert G (2011) Collaboration and peer tutoring in chemistry laboratory education.

Typical instructional activities were contrasted with CWPT for 18 children with ADHD and 10 peer comparison students attending first- through fifth-grade general education classes. CWPT led to increases in active engagement in academic tasks along with reductions in off-task behavior for most participants. Of students with ADHD, 50% exhibited improvements in academic performance in math or spelling during CWPT conditions, as measured by a treatment success index. Participating teachers and students reported a high level of satisfaction with intervention procedures. Our results suggest that peer tutoring appears to be an effective strategy for addressing the academic and behavioral difficulties associated with ADHD in general education settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"DuPaul George J; Ervin Ruth A; Hook Christine L; McGoey Kara E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1901/jaba.1998.31-579","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"DuPaul George J, Ervin Ruth A, Hook Christine L, and McGoey Kara E (1998) Peer tutoring for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: Effects on classroom behavior and academic performance.

We also explored the influence of gender. We assigned 72 ninth-graders (36 M, 36 F), all novices in a table tennis task, to a 2 × 3 (Gender × Learning Condition: physical practice with trained RPT [TRPT] vs. physical practice with spontaneous RPT [SRPT]vs. physical practice without any form of RPT [PP; individual control condition]) factorial design. Results indicated superior motor performance and cognitive skills for the TRPT condition and no difference between the SRPT and PP conditions. The peer-tutor training was thus a crucial organizational variable of the success of RPT. Interestingly, our results support the assumption that females particularly benefit from a highly structured peer tutoring framework.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: a) Trained RPT,b) non-Trained RPT, c) no RPT.

We also explored the influence of gender. We assigned 72 ninth-graders (36 M, 36 F), all novices in a table tennis task, to a 2 × 3 (Gender × Learning Condition: physical practice with trained RPT [TRPT] vs. physical practice with spontaneous RPT [SRPT]vs. physical practice without any form of RPT [PP; individual control condition]) factorial design. Results indicated superior motor performance and cognitive skills for the TRPT condition and no difference between the SRPT and PP conditions. The peer-tutor training was thus a crucial organizational variable of the success of RPT. Interestingly, our results support the assumption that females particularly benefit from a highly structured peer tutoring framework.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: a) Trained RPT, b) non-Trained RPT, c) no RPT.

The research combines a quasi-experimental design with the use of comparison groups and pre-tests/ post-tests for both variables; a qualitative approach is adopted by analysing the interactions in order to detect influencing factors. Statistically significant results were obtained for all students in terms of RC but only for student tutors in relation to reading self-concept. The factors involved in the improvements identified in RC are: reading strategies, scaffolding in inferential and deep comprehension questions. Regarding self-concept, the tutor’s own role, his involvement with their tutees’ progress, reading aloud and the metacognitive reflection processes, are all factors that enable us to explain the improvement in the tutor’s reading self-perception. The positive influence of peer tutoring on the development of reading competence through this programme is clearly evident.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Flores Marta ; Duran David ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9817.12044","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Flores Marta, and Duran David (2016) Influence of a Catalan peer tutoring programme on reading comprehension and self‐concept as a reader.

Twelve schools, stratified on student achievement and family income, were assigned randomly to experimental and control groups. Twenty teachers implemented the peer tutoring program for 15 weeks; 20 did not implement it. In each of the 40 classrooms, data were collected systematically on three students representing the three learner types. Pre- and posttreatment reading achievement data were collected on three measures of the Comprehensive Reading Assessment Battery.

current study employed a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the use of peer tutoring and fluency-based instruction to increase mathematics fluency with addition and subtraction computation skills. Forty-one elementary school students between the ages of eight and 12 years participated in the 8-week study using cross-age peer tutoring, Say All Fast Minute Every Day Shuffled, frequency building, and the morningside math facts curriculum (Johnson in Morningside mathematics fluency: math facts (vol 1–6; curriculum program), Morningside Press, Seattle, 2008). Pre- and post-test measures of mathematics fluency and calculation were conducted with all participants. A measure of social skills and competing problem behaviors was also conducted at pre- and post-testing to evaluate any additional effects of the peer tutoring model. The results demonstrated a statistically significant difference between groups on measures of mathematics fluency, with the experimental group demonstrating significantly higher scores than the control group at post-testing. There were no significant differences between groups on measures of social skills and competing problem behaviors or calculation. The findings indicate that cross-age peer tutoring and fluency-based instruction resulted in positive outcomes for tutees in the mathematics domain, specifically mathematics fluency.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 groups: a) Experimental (tutees), b) control, c) tutor.

Three groups were compared over grades as follows: (a) an at-risk experimental group of low-socioeconomic status (SES) students for whom teachers implemented classwide peer tutoring (CWPT) beginning with the second semester of first grade continuing through Grade 3; (h) an equivalent at-risk control group; and (c) a non-risk comparison group of students of average- to high-SES. In both the control and comparison groups, teachers employed conventional instructional practices over Grades 1 through 3. Results indicated significant group differences in the time spent in academic instruction, engagement, and gains on the subtests of the Metropolitan Achievement Test that favored the experimental and comparison groups over the control group. Implications include the effectiveness of CWPT for at-risk students and the continuing vulnerability of at-risk students whose daily instructional programs provide less instructional time and foster lower levels of active academic engagement.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms in this study: (a) an at-risk experimental group of low-socioeconomic status (SES) class wide peer tutoring (CWPT); (b) an equivalent at-risk control group; and (c) a non-risk comparison group of students of average- to high-SES.

This article presents three related evaluation studies looking at the effectiveness on achievement and motivation of Reading Together, a cross-age peer-tutoring reading program. The effects on tutees, tutors, teachers, and parents were monitored. The advantages of Reading Together began to accrue during the second and third phases of the program. Comparisons to the teaching of reading in the students' regular classrooms were made, and those regular classroom teachers who favored a skills-based approach, as opposed to a whole language or phonics approach recorded the greatest gains for students in the participating group and also for those in the control group.","Comments":"MDE: Please code Evaluation 3.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hattie John ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2006.04.003","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hattie John (2006) Cross-age tutoring and the reading together program.

Participants (N = 131) included band (n = 71) and choir (n = 60) students whose backgrounds reflected extensive economic (78% free or reduced lunch) and ethnic diversity (44% Hispanic, 31% Caucasian, 6% African American, 11% Asian/Pacific islander, 8% Native American). Using a randomized, post-test only experimental design, students were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: traditional teacher-led instruction or reciprocal peer-based instruction. After a two-week instruction period, results show that students receiving peer-based instruction demonstrated significantly higher levels of rhythm reading achievement than students receiving traditional teacher led instruction. Factorial ANOVA analyses revealed that music reading self-concept did not significantly moderate rhythm reading achievement. A significant interaction was found between ensemble type (band/choir) and method of instruction (on rhythm reading achievement) with peer-based instruction effects on rhythm reading achievement noticeably stronger for choir students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Johnson Erik A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Johnson Erik A (2011) The effect of peer-based instruction on rhythm reading achievement.

The treatment group children were exposed to PALS during 20 min sessions, 4 times a week, for 8 weeks. The impacts of PALS were investigated in 3 aspects using a mixed-methods approach: improvement in reading attitudes, reading skills, and student perceptions of the intervention. Data collection includes reading attitude measures, standardized reading comprehension test scores, student satisfaction survey, student interviews, and student journals. The PALS group students showed significantly enhanced reading attitudes and reading skills. Consistently, qualitative data analysis also revealed affirmative influence of PALS on students’ attitudes toward reading. Finally, the findings also suggested social benefits of PALS including developing cooperative skills and friendships.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lee Youngju ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00220671.2013.836469","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lee Youngju (2014) Promise for enhancing children's reading attitudes through peer reading: A mixed method approach.

The findings support the hypothesis that the observed improvement of students’ reading comprehension achievement can be attributed considerably to the acquisition of a repertoire of reading strategies and improved reading attitudes. But the potential role of motivational factors and an enhanced metacognitive awareness cannot be ruled out, although the effect sizes were less impressive. The present findings do not support the hypothesis that peer tutoring practice increases the use of reading strategy, or improves metacognitive awareness and attitudes on top of the effect of explicit reading strategies instruction. In Chinese primary school classrooms, individual practice of reading strategies under the teachers’ guidance seems to have comparable positive effects to practice in dyads. Between the two peer tutoring practice, RSA condition in general has less favorable results than CA condition.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus on Chapter 3.

The findings support the hypothesis that the observed improvement of students’ reading comprehension achievement can be attributed considerably to the acquisition of a repertoire of reading strategies and improved reading attitudes. But the potential role of motivational factors and an enhanced metacognitive awareness cannot be ruled out, although the effect sizes were less impressive. The present findings do not support the hypothesis that peer tutoring practice increases the use of reading strategy, or improves metacognitive awareness and attitudes on top of the effect of explicit reading strategies instruction. In Chinese primary school classrooms, individual practice of reading strategies under the teachers’ guidance seems to have comparable positive effects to practice in dyads. Between the two peer tutoring practice, RSA condition in general has less favorable results than CA condition.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus on chapter 4.

The program used a conditional cash transfer contract to encourage peer tutors to help their underperforming classmates. Incentivized peer-tutoring significantly improved the academic performance of the underperforming tutees over a semester. The impact persisted in the second semester when the intervention was removed. Our results suggest that nongovernment organizations and government agencies can increase their capacity of remedying education by incorporating incentivized peer-tutoring into their existing merit-based scholarship and conditional cash transfer programs.","Comments":"MDE: There are 2 schools (A & B) with three groups each: a) monetary, b) non-monetary, c) control.

investigation compared the use of traditional instruction with that of classwide peer tutoring using materials containing embedded mnemonic strategies to provide strategic information and supplemental practice of important content. Eight inclusive seventh grade social studies classes with 186 students, of whom 42 were classified with mild disabilities, were randomly assigned to treatment and traditional conditions, delivered over 10 weeks of instruction. All students were given a pretest, three unit tests, and a posttest. Overall findings revealed that experimental condition classes statistically outperformed comparison condition classes on content learned; this was true for target content (taught directly in the experimental condition) as well as nontarget content (related information not included in the experimental condition). Implications for inclusive content area instruction are provided.","Comments":"Please focus in total gain scores in general education students.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Marshak Lisa ; Mastropieri Margo A; Scruggs Thomas E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09362835.2011.562092","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Marshak Lisa, Mastropieri Margo A, and Scruggs Thomas E (2011) Curriculum enhancements in inclusive secondary social studies classrooms.

recent years it has been observed that mathematics is the subject with the lowest results in Spain and Europe. Several authors indicate that this low performance is due, among other factors, to a traditional teaching approach. In this experiment, an experience of peer tutoring in the area of mathematics was carried out in a 1st grade classroom. The number of participants was 18, forming 9 pairs of students. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used with no control group.The effect of this methodology on students\\u0027 academic performance was analyzed. The analysis of the results showed an overall statistically significant improvement in academic performance (t-test =3.11, p\\u003c.01). The effect size associated with the experience was Hedge\\u0027s g = 0.51. Despite the success of this experience, these results should be viewed with caution. The fact that this was an experience of short duration, with a small number of students and the absence of a control group should lead the reader to consider the final results of this work cautiously.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Martí-Alcaide Andrés ; Alegre Francisco ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Martí-Alcaide Andrés, and Alegre Francisco (2021) The influence of fixed peer tutoring on student academic achievement: An experience in primary school mathematics.

purpose of this investigation was to compare outcomes associated with peer tutoring vs. teacher-directed instruction for secondary level students with mild disabilities in inclusive chemistry classes. Thirty-nine students of whom 10 were classified with disabilities participated in a 9-week chemistry unit, under either experimental or traditional instruction conditions. The same co-teachers, including one chemistry and one special education teacher during the regularly assigned chemistry classes, taught both classes. The students in the experimental condition participated in classwide peer tutoring of important content required on statewide high stakes testing. Mnemonic and other verbal cues were included to facilitate verbal recall, and peer questioning provided for comprehension and elaboration of the concepts. Post-tests revealed that students in the tutoring condition outperformed students in the traditional condition, and that the gains of the students with learning disabilities descriptively exceeded those of the typically-achieving students. Students without learning disabilities outperformed students with learning disabilities, and students scored higher on factual items than on comprehension items. Implications for instruction and future research are discussed.","Comments":"Please compare experimental vs. traditional groups.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mastropieri Margo A; Scruggs Thomas E; Graetz Janet E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0735-004X(05)18005-7","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mastropieri Margo A, Scruggs Thomas E, and Graetz Janet E (2005) Cognition and learning in inclusive high school chemistry classes.

(PALS) to supplement classroom reading instruction. Findings indicate that compared to previous years, when PALS was not used, students in this study made significantly greater gains in reading scores. Boys made similar gains to girls, Aboriginal students made similar gains to non-Aboriginal students, and at-risk students closed the achievement gap slightly with their typically achieving peers. For students who did not make adequate progress in reading throughout the year, the data indicate that the best predictor of at-risk status by the end of 1st grade was not a student’s sex or Aboriginal status but the ease with which he or she could effortlessly identify the sounds of letters and read words on entering the 1st grade.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mattatall Chris A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10573569.2016.1142914","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mattatall Chris A (2017) Using Peer Assisted Learning Strategies for boys, Aboriginal learners, and at-risk populations.

Impact of peer tutoring was assessed using a 2 condition by 2 settings by 2 types of students analysis of covariance with pretests as covariates. Results indicate that the peer-tutoring intervention was associated with improvements in student performance, and students in co-teaching settings perform better than those in non-co-teaching settings, but no additional value was added when peer tutoring was implemented in co-taught classrooms. Because co-teaching is increasingly used for teaching students with disabilities in general education classroom settings, implications of these findings for current practice and the need for future research are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus on the Peer-tutoring versus no Peer tutoring comparison but record that some classes involved co-teaching for the “Who was responsible for the teaching at the point of delivery?’ question.\nESDE: There is only sufficient data to record the overall Peer tutoring/No Peer tutoring comparison using the Cumulative means and SDs from the post-test (Table 2 Columns 4-6).","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McDuffie Kimberly A; Mastropieri Margo A; Scruggs Thomas E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F001440290907500406","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McDuffie Kimberly A, Mastropieri Margo A, and Scruggs Thomas E (2009) Differential effects of peer tutoring in co-taught and non-co-taught classes: Results for content learning and student-teacher interactions.

strategy interventions relying upon peer tutoring are a common way to foster poor readers' comprehension skills. Those interventions are based on the assumption that tutees benefit from the (higher) reading skills of their tutors. However, this interpersonal effect has not yet been tested explicitly because the effectiveness of peer tutoring is commonly analyzed separately for tutees and tutors or with aggregated data. The present study illustrates how interpersonal and individual effects of a peer-tutored reading strategy intervention can be estimated using dyads as units of analysis in structural equation modeling. To demonstrate the application of the model, data from an experimental intervention study comparing the effects of a peer-tutored reading strategy training and a control condition in Grade 4 (N = 68 dyads) were analyzed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Müller Bettina ; Richter Tobias ; Križan Ana ; Hecht Teresa ; Ennemoser Marco ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00220973.2015.1065219","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Müller Bettina, Richter Tobias, Križan Ana, Hecht Teresa, and Ennemoser Marco (2016) How to analyze interpersonal and individual effects in peer-tutored reading intervention.

The study adopted a randomized pre-test, post-test control group design. Two hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. Purposive sampling technique was used to select four (4) Private Secondary Schools from Minna, Metropolis. Eighty (80) Students were drawn from the four Secondary Schools as sample size through stratified random sampling technique. Validated Test Instrument; Basic Computer Skills Acquisition Test (BCSAT) and Questionnaire: Motivated Strategy for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) vetted by experts from Computer Science and Educational Technology Departments were used for data collection. The BCSAT was made up of 20 items multiple-choice objective test questions to test students’ cognitive knowledge and 5 practical questions, each comprising steps that tested students’ computer practical skills while MSLQ, a Likert scale with 31 items was used to determine the motivational beliefs of students taught computer skills. ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis H test was used for data analysis and was tested at 0.05 level of significance. The study revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of students taught using Peer-Mediated Learning (PML) than those taught using conventional method. The study further revealed that students’ motivation towards PML were significantly positive when compared to the students taught using conventional method. Based on these findings, the researchers recommended that Secondary Schools should adopt PML for effective teaching and learning of computer skills related concepts in Computer Science.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ohadugha Rosemary Ogechi; Chukwuemeka Emeka Joshua; Babatunde Abdullateef Eyitayo; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.30935/cedtech/7629","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ohadugha Rosemary Ogechi, Chukwuemeka Emeka Joshua, and Babatunde Abdullateef Eyitayo (2020) Impact of Peer-Mediated Learning on Achievement and Motivation in Computer Science among Senior Secondary School Students in Minna Metropolis, Niger State..

It also compared the effects of peer tutoring and think-pair-share strategies in improving students’ attitude towards Chemistry. These were with a view to highlighting which of the teaching strategies that can improve students’ academic performance in Chemistry. The study adopted a non-equivalent pre-test, post-test control group experimental research design. The population for the study consisted of all public senior secondary class one (SS 1) science students in Osogbo. Out of the two local government areas in Osogbo, Olorunda Local Government was selected using simple random sampling technique. Three senior secondary schools were selected in the Local Government Area and one intact class was selected from each of the schools using simple random sampling technique. The total sample size was 113 (38, 37 and 38 from each of the three schools). The schools were randomly assigned to three groups (Peer Tutoring, Think-Pair-Share and Teacher Expository) using simple random sampling technique. Two instruments, the Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT) and Questionnaire on Attitudes of Students towards Chemistry (QASTC) were used to collect data for the study. Data collected were analysed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA).The results showed that, there was a significant difference in the performance of students exposed to peer tutoring, think-pair-share instructional strategies and those exposed to teacher expository teaching strategy (F= 28.970; p 0.05). The Think-Pair-Share Teaching Strategy (TPSTS) had best significant effect on student academic performance than Peer Tutoring Teaching Strategy (PTTS) and Teacher Expository Teaching Strategy (TETS). Students exposed to TPSTS had a mean difference of 1.8904 when compared with PTTS and 4.1287 mean difference when compared with TETS. The study concluded that think-pair-share was a better teaching strategy in improving students’ academic performance in Chemistry than peer tutoring teaching strategy and the teacher expository teaching strategy respectively.","Comments":"This study has 3 groups: 1. Peer tutoring, 2. Think-pair-share & 3. teacher exposition. Please compare 1 vs. 3 as primary outcome and 2 vs. 3 for secondary outcome.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Oloyede Muhideen Abiodun; Bamidele Emmanuel Folorunso; Oladipupo Popoola Oluwasegun; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Oloyede Muhideen Abiodun, Bamidele Emmanuel Folorunso, and Oladipupo Popoola Oluwasegun (2019) Relative effectiveness of peer tutoring and think-pair-share strategies in improving senior secondary school students’ academic performance in chemistry in Osogbo.

study investigated the effectiveness of the peer tutoring instructional strategy in improving students’ academic achievement in financial accounting concepts. A nonrandomized pretest-posttest control group quasi-experimental design with a 2 × 2 × 3 factorial matrix was adopted. The research sample comprised 137 purposively selected students from eight intact classes in secondary schools in Southern Nigeria. The experimental group adopted a peer tutoring instructional strategy, while the control group was exposed to the conventional lecture method. Teachers’ Instructional Guides on peer tutoring and conventional method and Financial Accounting Achievement Test were used to collect data for this study. Results affirmed that the peer tutoring instructional strategy is more effective in improving students’ academic achievement in financial accounting concepts than the conventional lecture method. The outcome of this study also shows that the experimental strategy was not sensitive to gender but sensitive to socioeconomic status. Sequel to this finding, the study recommends that post-basic school teachers should make use of the peer tutoring instructional strategy to present financial accounting lessons in secondary schools to advance students’ attainment in the subject.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Olulowo Taiwo Grace; Ige Olugbenga A; Ugwoke Ernest O; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8871235","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Olulowo Taiwo Grace, Ige Olugbenga A, and Ugwoke Ernest O (2020) Using Peer Tutoring to Improve Students’ Academic Achievement in Financial Accounting Concepts.

is an important life skill which must be mastered in order to actively participate in today’s society. The ability to read is arguably the most important aspect of literacy skills and as such it transcends subject areas. In consequence of this, literacy has become a major focal point of today's educational system. In classrooms throughout America, tutoring is implemented as a form of supplemental instruction. This is done under the assumption that tutoring truly is an effective means of increasing student achievement in the core curricular areas. As current research suggests that tutoring is an effective means of increasing students' skills in the area of literacy, particularly reading comprehension, this research study explores that truth. Specific focus is given to identifying which format, direct tutoring or peer tutoring, is more effective for increasing student achievement within the realm of reading comprehension of middle school-aged students. This study was conducted in an urban school district where less than half of the student population tests at the proficiency level on the 6th grade New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Exam. The heterogeneous sample group of twenty sixth grade students was randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups; a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group. The students for the two groups were pulled from all three of the ability-grouped sixth grade homerooms with a representative number of male and female students to eliminate gender as a possible construct. Peer tutors were selected and trained on the procedures and routines of tutoring. The study was conducted over eight, one-hour tutoring sessions. Research data includes pre and post-test assessments, student journals, and observational notes regarding student levels of engagement, on-task behavior, and their active participation in the tutoring session. Research data reports that while students in both groups increased in reading comprehension literacy, students in the peer tutoring group had a greater change overall. This suggests that peer tutoring may be more effective in increasing the reading comprehension achievement of middle school students in urban populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Pastore Patrick James; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pastore Patrick James (2008) Reading Comprehension Achievement and Peer vs. Teacher-Directed Tutoring. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023548,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":12172939,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":872670,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"The aim of this study was to find out if reciprocal teaching was superior to traditional\nmethods when teaching fourth and sixth graders in mainstream education with\ntypically developing children and when teaching children who had specific language\nimpairment (SLI).

comprehension of fourth and sixth graders was promoted with reciprocal teaching in three mainstream classes, and three special classes for pupils with specific language impairment (SLI). Four cognitive strategies were used to enhance these pupils’ reading comprehension skills. Six coordinated, 5-week interventions were held during regular class sessions in the spring and autumn terms of 2003. These interventions, which varied in length from 10 to 15 lessons, were given to all students attending fourth-grade and sixth-grade science classes in general science and sixth-grade history lessons. A control group/experiment group design was used. According to pre-, post- and retention tests the intervention proved to be beneficial, especially to the mainstream fourth-grade class. Some positive development could also be noticed in the SLI groups. The results of children improved mostly in expert-designed tests on reading comprehension. According to the interviews,children and teachers were pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in the interventions and to learn a new method of improving reading comprehension.","Comments":"Coders: Please focus on the mainstream students only.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Takala Marjatta ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00313830600953824","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Takala Marjatta (2006) The Effects of Reciprocal Teaching on Reading Comprehension in Mainstream and Special (SLI) Education.

The objectives of the study were: (1) To find out the effects of peer tutoring on the academic achievement of students in the subject of biology; and (2) To examine the effects of peer tutoring with respect to knowledge, comprehension and application levels in cognitive domain of Bloom Taxonomy. All 433,405 male students at secondary level of 10th grade of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were the population of the study. Forty students were taken as the sample of the study from the Allied National Software Institute (ANSI) Mardan. The Posttest-Only Equivalent Group Design was used. The data collected from pretest and posttest were analyzed through an independent sample t-test. It was found that the mean score of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group. It was concluded that peer tutoring enhanced the academic achievement of students in the experimental group significantly as compared to the control group; hence, it was an effective method of instruction for teaching biology at secondary level. It was suggested that peer tutoring may be incorporated along with other teaching methodologies for the subject of biology and it may be given due consideration in all teacher education practices in the country.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ullah Irfan ; Tabassum Rabia ; Kaleem Muhammad ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci8030112","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ullah Irfan, Tabassum Rabia, and Kaleem Muhammad (2018) Effects of Peer Tutoring on the Academic Achievement of Students in the Subject of Biology at Secondary Level.

This study explored data from 40 purposefully selected participants of ANSI school Mardan, by applying the Pre-test Post-test Equivalent Group Design of experimental design and conducting achievement tests before and after the treatments in order to accomplish the target objectives. The analysis of the data through inferential statistics (t-test) confirmed that though the tutors of the experimental group achieved better score at knowledge and application levels of the cognitive domain; however, they were not better in the comprehension level on post-test in compare to the high achievers of the control group. In the same way, the performance of the tutees of the group under investigation was significantly better with regards to academic ability knowledge and comprehension at cognitive domain; however, at the application level there was no significant difference as compare to their correspondent low achievers of the controlled group.

Research reveals that explicit reading strategies instruction and engaging students in interaction about texts promote students' reading comprehension ability. The present intervention study combines both aspects. Aims. The study examines the educational benefits of explicit reading strategies instruction, followed by practice in (a) teacher-led whole-class activities (STRAT), (b) reciprocal same-age (STRAT + SA), or (c) cross-age peer tutoring activities (STRAT + CA) on fifth graders' reading comprehension achievement. Sample. Twenty-two fifth-grade teachers and their 454 students from 19 different schools throughout Flanders (Belgium) participated. Method. A quasi-experimental pretest post-test retention test design was used with three experimental (STRAT, STRAT + SA, and STRAT + CA) and a matched control group. The experimental interventions were implemented during an entire school year. Results. Multilevel analysis revealed that the STRAT and STRAT + CA condition made a significantly larger pretest to retention test progress than the control group. The significant major progress was especially situated from pretest to post-test, during which the intervention took place. Concerning the STRAT + SA condition no significant differences with regard to the control group were detected. Pairwise comparisons of the experimental conditions indicated that the STRAT + CA condition's progress from pretest to retention test also exceeded the STRAT + SA condition's advancement significantly. Conclusion. The study corroborated the efficacy of the STRAT and STRAT + CA conditions' interventions as feasible tools to enhance fifth graders' reading comprehension achievement.","Comments":"MDE: There are 4 arms.

For 2nd graders, multilevel analyses revealed significant STRAT and STRAT + CA effects; however, the effects did not last after finishing the program. Fifth graders in all 3 experimental conditions performed significantly better on the posttest than their control group peers. Results also showed continued growth for the STRAT and STRAT + CA conditions until at least 6 months after students finished the program. Moreover, on both the posttest and retention test, 5th graders in the STRAT + CA condition reported significantly fewer negative thoughts related to their reading proficiency.","Comments":"MDE: There are 4 groups: Strategies-only condition (STRAT), Same-age peer-tutoring (STRAT + SA), Cross-age peer-tutoring (STRAT + CA) and control group.
