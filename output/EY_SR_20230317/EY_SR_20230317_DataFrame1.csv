47063511,Barnett (2008),2008,"The effectiveness of the Tools of the Mind (Tools) curriculum in improving the education of 3- and 4-year-old children was evaluated by means of a randomized trial. The Tools curriculum, based on the work of Vygotsky, focuses on the development of self-regulation at the same time as teaching literacy and mathematics skills in a way that is socially mediated by peers and teachers and with a focus on play. The control group experienced an established district-created model described as a 'balanced literacy curriculum with themes.' Teachers and students were randomly assigned to either treatment or control classrooms. Children (88 Tools and 122 control) were compared on social behavior, language, and literacy growth. The Tools curriculum was found to improve classroom quality and children's executive function as indicated by lower scores on a problem behavior scale. There were indications that Tools also improved children's language development, but these effects were smaller and did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance in multi-level models or after adjustments for multiple comparisons. Our findings indicate that a developmentally appropriate curriculum with a strong emphasis on play can enhance learning and development so as to improve both the social and academic success of young children. Moreover, it is suggested that to the extent child care commonly increases behavior problems this outcome may be reversed through the use of more appropriate curricula that actually enhance self-regulation.

Here, we experimentally evaluate an innovative approach to the education of children in kindergarten that embeds support for self-regulation, particularly executive functions, into literacy, mathematics, and science learning activities. Results from a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 29 schools, 79 classrooms, and 759 children indicated positive effects on executive functions, reasoning ability, the control of attention, and levels of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase. Results also demonstrated improvements in reading, vocabulary, and mathematics at the end of kindergarten that increased into the first grade.

Using a randomized controlled design, the present study investigated the effects of a 12-week mindfulness-based Kindness Curriculum (KC) delivered in a public school setting on executive function, self-regulation, and prosocial behavior in a sample of 68 preschool children. The KC intervention group showed greater improvements in social competence and earned higher report card grades in domains of learning, health, and social-emotional development, whereas the control group exhibited more selfish behavior over time. Interpretation of effect sizes overall indicate small to medium effects favoring the KC group on measures of cognitive flexibility and delay of gratification. Baseline functioning was found to moderate treatment effects with KC children initially lower in social competence and executive functioning demonstrating larger gains in social competence relative to the control group. These findings, observed over a relatively short intervention period, support the promise of this program for promoting self-regulation and prosocial behavior in young children.

Twenty-two urban elementary schools serving low-income families were randomly assigned to INSIGHTS or a supplemental reading program that served as an attention-control condition. Data on 435 students in 122 classrooms were collected at 5 time points across kindergarten and 1st grade. Students received intervention in the 2nd half of kindergarten and the 1st half of 1st grade. Their teachers and parents participated in the program at the same time. Two-level hierarchical linear models were used to examine both within- and between-child changes in achievement across kindergarten and 1st grades. Results revealed that children enrolled in INSIGHTS experienced growth in math and reading achievement and sustained attention that was significantly faster than that of children enrolled in the supplemental reading program. In addition, although children participating in INSIGHTS evidenced decreases in behavior problems over time, children enrolled in the supplemental reading program demonstrated increases. Effects on math and reading were partially mediated through a reduction in behavior problems, and effects on reading were partially mediated through an improvement in sustained attention. Results indicate that INSIGHTS enhances the academic development of early elementary school children and supports the need for policies that provide social-emotional intervention for children at risk for academic problems.","['Metacognition and self-regulation', 'EY_Self-regulation strategies']",NA,,['EY_January 2023'],"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""Twenty-two urban\nelementary schools[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 6:\n[¬s]""During the same 10 weeks, the classroom program was deliv-\nered in 45-min lessons to all students in the classrooms of partic-\nipating teachers.

Over a 4-week period, parents, teachers and graduate assistants read about 70 picture books to each participant (N=48, mean age 4 6). The experimental group received books with text rich in explicit metacognitive terms. The control group received the same books with no metacognitive language but with most stories and accompanying illustrations implicitly requiring children to think about alternative perspectives. Results from pre-test to post-test show firstly, that exposing children to explicit metacognitive vocabulary resulted in significantly more metacognitive verb production in story telling but no improvement in metacognitive language comprehension. This demonstrates Nelson's [""Language in Cognitive Development  Emergence of the Mediated Mind,"" Cambridge University Press, New York, 1996] notion that children ""use"" such vocabulary before fully understanding the concepts. A second finding was that the control group children outperformed the experimental group on a false-belief explanation battery.

In addition, increasing evidence shows that computerized process‐based training enhances cognitive skills. However, no prior studies have examined the effect of combining these two training strategies. The goal of this study was to test the combined effect of metacognitive scaffolding and computer‐based training of executive attention in a sample of typically developing preschoolers at the cognitive and brain levels. Compared to children in the regular training protocol and an untrained active control group, children in the metacognitive group showed larger gains on intelligence and significant increases on an electrophysiological index associated with conflict processing. Moreover, changes in the conflict‐related brain activity predicted gains in intelligence in the metacognitive scaffolding group. These results suggest that metacognitive scaffolding boosts the influence of process‐based training on cognitive efficiency and brain plasticity related to executive attention. A few sessions of training with a process‐based program of executive attention combined with metacognitive scaffolding produce cognitive and brain function benefits.

Assessment of performance in a range of tasks, targeting attention, intelligence and regulation of affect was carried out in three occasions  (1) before, (2) after, and (3) two months after completion of training. Also, brain function was examined with a high-density electroencephalogram system. Results demonstrate that trained children activate the executive attention network faster and more efficiently than untrained children, an effect that was still observed two months after without further training. Also, evidence of transfer of attention training to fluid intelligence and, to a lesser degree, to regulation of affect was observed.

However, no study to date has investigated whether targeted training focusing on those domains might be comparable with regular schooling in improving EF and fluid intelligence (Gf). The aim of the present study was to replicate and extend the previously demonstrated schooling effects on EF by using a school‐cutoff design, and to further investigate whether a theoretically motivated intervention targeting specific EF, i.e., working memory (WM) or inhibitory control (IC), could achieve comparable effects with schooling in both, WM and IC, as well as Gf. 91 6‐year‐old kindergarteners and first‐graders with similar chronological age participated the study. We compared the performance of a first‐grade schooling group with that of two kindergarten training groups as well as a business‐as‐usual kindergarten control group. Participants were assessed in WM, IC and Gf at baseline, immediately after the intervention (posttest), as well as 3 months after training completion (follow‐up). The results showed that the schooling group indeed outperformed the kindergarten groups at baseline in several cognitive tasks. Furthermore, both the WM and IC training showed pronounced gains in the trained tasks, as well as varying degrees of improvement in non‐trained outcome measures. Most importantly, both training groups achieved comparable performance with the schooling group, which was especially apparent in Gf at follow‐up. Our findings provide further evidence for the malleability of EF demonstrating that both, long‐term and short‐term interventions can facilitate the acquisition of those important skills, and as such, our work has important implications for educational practice. Comparing first graders and kindergartners with similar chronological age at baseline, we observed so‐called schooling effects which were most pronounced in a test of fluid reasoning. However, targeted training that focused on either working memory or inhibitory control led to improvements in fluid reasoning as observed three months after training completion. Kindergartners who received targeted training were ultimately able to catch up with their first‐grade peers.","['EY_Self-regulation strategies', 'Metacognition and self-regulation']",NA,,['EY_January 2023'],"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['China'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Ninety- one typically- developing children (25 “young” first grad- ers and 66 “old” kindergarteners;""\n""The two kindergarten training groups completed a 15- min\nintervention each day, 4 times per week, for a total of 20 sessions\nin addition to their kindergarten routine activities.[¬e]""']",NA,,Unclear,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Two child- friendly tasks were used for the IC intervention: An adap-\ntive stop- signal task (Berkman, Kahn, & Merchant, 2014), and a mod-\nified Stroop task (Rueda et al., 2012)[¬e]""', 'Page 4:\n[¬s]""Stop- signal task\nThe go stimuli comprised of a strawberry and a peach (150 × 150\npixels in size) (see Figure 1b).
