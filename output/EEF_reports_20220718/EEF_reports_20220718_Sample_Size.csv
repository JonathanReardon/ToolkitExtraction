A further three schools—one in the Catch Up® arm and two in the active control—were lost to the follow- up post-test in October–December 2017. The intervention school had fully implemented the Catch Up® Numeracy intervention, but was unwilling to administer additional tests to their pupils. Although attrition was within acceptable bounds at the school level (5%), at pupil-level, attrition was high (17%). Of the 1,794 pupils who received treatment in the Catch Up® and active control arms at the start of the main trial, 1,775 were matched to National Pupil Database records (after the withdrawal of the Catch Up® schools) and complete records for the primary model were available for a total of 1,481 pupils. This was 83% of pupils randomised—737 pupils receiving Catch Up® and 744 pupils receiving the active control condition. Attrition was due to a combination of factors in addition to school and pupil withdrawals: • Delayed post-testing: the delayed post-testing took place in the autumn term of the academic year following implementation. As a result, 129 pupils, 7% of pupils allocated, had left school (including transfers to middle schools). • Pupil absence: 107 pupils were absent at the time of post-testing; 49 pupils completed the post- tests later. However, a total of 58 pupils, 3% of pupils allocated, were missing post-tests. • Missing pre- and post-tests: despite considerable efforts and additional expense by the evaluation team, GL Assessment were unable to account for 60 pre-tests and 7 post-tests, leading to further attrition of 49 pupils (42 pre-tests and 7 post-tests). This constituted 3% of pupils allocated and resulted in the loss of pre-tests for two complete schools. Without the attrition due to pupils leaving schools and the missing GL tests, the level of attrition would have been well below 10%.[¬e]""', 'Page 28:\n[¬s]""Withdrew after randomisation but before notification, because ineligible for intervention (school n=1, pupil n =12) Withdrew / opted-out (pupil n=1)""\n""Withdrew / opt-out (pupil n=4)""\n""Lost to follow up Withdrew (school n=3, pupil n=36) Left school (pupil n=64) Absent (pupil n=30) Missing GL post- tests (pupil n=7)""\n""Not analysed Missing GL pre-tests (school n=0, pupil n=8)""\n""Not analysed Missing GL pre-tests (school n=2, pupil n=34)""\n""Lost to follow up Withdrew (school n=3, pupil n=36) Left school (pupil n=65) Absent (pupil n=28)[¬e]""']",NA,"['Page 28:\n[¬s]""Catch Up® ""\n"" pupil n=900)""\n""Analysed ""\n"" pupil n=737)[¬e]""']",,18.111,"['Page 28:\n[¬s]""Catch Up® ""\n"" pupil n=900)""\n""Active control ""\n"" pupil n=911)""\n""Analysed ""\n"" pupil n=737)""\n""Analysed ""\n"" pupil n=744)[¬e]""']",,18.221%,

This eligible pupil did not take the post-test. In addition, it was not possible to collect post-test data for 96 intervention pupils and 72 control pupils. They were either absent on the day of the testing (n=93), or had left the school (n=44), or were present but did not take the test (n=29), or parents had withdrawn their participation from the trial (n=2). These pupils were from a number of intervention and control schools where other pupils took the post-test. Please refer to the ‘follow-up’ section of Figure 2. Finally, there were some pupils for whom we had post-test data but no prior attainment data. We excluded these from the primary analysis. Therefore, overall, the primary analysis involved 501 pupils from 69 intervention schools and 505 pupils from 72 control schools. On average, there were seven pupils per school, with some schools with two pupils and other schools with twelve pupils. Overall, 1,006 pupils were retained in the analysis out of 1,217 pupils who were meant to be followed up. This resulted in an overall pupil attrition to be 17%.

In total 47 classes in 12 schools (47/169 = 28% of the classes randomised, with approximately 1480 pupils) dropped out from the trial post-allocation. \uf0b7 Four schools (14 classes) did not want to take part in the intervention after randomisation on the basis of the allocation of classes that had occurred. Reasons given for this were that the randomisation had resulted in a less experienced teacher being given an intervention class and the more experienced one given a control class, or because of part-time teachers or job-share in the selected intervention class. This was deemed unacceptable or unworkable in these schools and they chose to withdraw from the study. In two of these four schools, the randomisation allocation for one year group proved unacceptable to the school, but in another year group the teachers were willing to work with the randomisation – thus only one instead of two year groups stayed in the study. Conversations were had with these schools to persuade them to allow testing of both years. However, they only allowed testing of one year. This may have introduced some bias. \uf0b7 One school (3 classes) decided following randomisation to withdraw one year group from the intervention for practical reasons but to continue with the intervention in another year group. This school decided it would be too difficult to operationalise the intervention given the way language was currently taught during teacher PPA time. \uf0b7 Two schools (10 classes) could not release the teachers for the initial training day and they chose to withdraw. The EDT offered a one to one session to keep schools involved, which was taken up by another school where teachers could not attend the initial training, but these two schools chose not to make use of the offer or to stay in the study. The expectations about training commitment were explicit in the MoU. \uf0b7 Five schools (20 classes) never responded to any communications from the EDT about the training, never booked to attend and did not arrive at the training; they also did not respond to further communication following the training. These schools were considered by the EDT to have dropped out of the programme, and when they did not respond to communication from the study team, were also withdrawn from the study. Although the intention was to include all classes in the intention to treat analysis regardless of whether they delivered the programme, for those classes that withdrew prior to any intervention, training or delivery, none of the schools were prepared to stay in the study or allow post-testing in either their control or their intervention classes. None of these 47 classes were included in the analysis. Attrition from the post-test There was also high attrition from the study between intervention delivery and post-test. At this stage, a further 31 classes from 9 schools, (c930 pupils) did not provide post-test data. \uf0b7 In seven schools the attrition occurred because of difficulties in the evaluation team organising access to the schools for testing. For three of these schools, this access was originally granted but due to a shortfall in fieldworkers, the testing was not able to take place on the scheduled days. These schools were then unwilling to reschedule the testing on an alternative date. A further four schools never offered dates for testing, despite repeated attempts, by email and telephone, by the evaluation team and the EEF to encourage them to take part. In one of these schools the key individual organising the participation had moved school and no one else was[¬e]""', 'Page 22:\n[¬s]""willing to organise the testing. In another of these schools that did not offer dates for testing, the teachers admitted they had not implemented the intervention, and so did not see the point of asking their children to complete the tests. A final school never responded to any communications about testing but teachers from this school neither attended the later training nor completed monitoring, so it is possible that they too had not implemented the intervention. \uf0b7 One school was dissatisfied with the post-intervention package of training being offered by the EDT. This school refused access for evaluation testing as a result of their displeasure. \uf0b7 In one school, only one year group agreed to post-testing. The other year group had in fact not implemented the intervention, and therefore did not consider it appropriate to ask the children to undertake the assessment. Additional attrition of pupils occurred within the classes where testing did take place: 162 children, from the 91 classes where testing occurred, did not participate in testing. Reasons for this included: parental opt-out of their child from the testing; children with special educational needs where teachers felt the testing would be inappropriate; and student absence (illness and other school activities that took them out of class).[¬e]""', 'Page 6:\n[¬s]""However, there was high attrition: more than 50% of the pupils who started the trial were not included in the final analysis, due to a large number of schools dropping out and problems with the testing.[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,56,NA,,56.740%,
