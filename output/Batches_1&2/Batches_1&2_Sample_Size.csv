As previously mentioned, I estimate models with and without school-level covariates. Without the school-level characteristics, complete case analysis yields a sample of 7303, which includes 5075 white, 1216 black and 1012 Hispanic children. With the school-level covariates included, the corresponding sample size drops to 5734, including 4189 white, 861 black and 684 Hispanic children. Most of the reduction in sample size is due to missing informa- tion on household income and school characteris- tics. 9 To understand the potential sensitivity of my results to the impact of missing data, I include separate binary indicators for those individuals with missing information on these covariates. 10 This increases sample size to 8164, which includes 5559 white, 1445 black and 1160 Hispanic children. These numbers represent 96 percent (5559 of 5785), 91 percent (1445 of 1583) and 94 percent (1160 of 1231) of the white, black and Hispanic analysis samples, respectively.[¬e]""']",['No information provided'],,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,['No SES/FSM Information Provided'],,NA,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""2615""\n""1122""\n""552[¬e]""']",,4289,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""2944""\n""323""\n""608[¬e]""']",,3875,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""2615""\n""1122""\n""552[¬e]""']",,4289,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""2944""\n""323""\n""608[¬e]""']",,3875,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,['No'],,NA,NA,NA,,0,NA,,0%,

A further three schools—one in the Catch Up® arm and two in the active control—were lost to the follow- up post-test in October–December 2017.

This was 83% of pupils randomised—737 pupils receiving Catch Up® and 744 pupils receiving the active control condition. Attrition was due to a combination of factors in addition to school and pupil withdrawals: • Delayed post-testing: the delayed post-testing took place in the autumn term of the academic year following implementation. As a result, 129 pupils, 7% of pupils allocated, had left school (including transfers to middle schools). • Pupil absence: 107 pupils were absent at the time of post-testing; 49 pupils completed the post- tests later. However, a total of 58 pupils, 3% of pupils allocated, were missing post-tests. • Missing pre- and post-tests: despite considerable efforts and additional expense by the evaluation team, GL Assessment were unable to account for 60 pre-tests and 7 post-tests, leading to further attrition of 49 pupils (42 pre-tests and 7 post-tests). This constituted 3% of pupils allocated and resulted in the loss of pre-tests for two complete schools.

This eligible pupil did not take the post-test. In addition, it was not possible to collect post-test data for 96 intervention pupils and 72 control pupils. They were either absent on the day of the testing (n=93), or had left the school (n=44), or were present but did not take the test (n=29), or parents had withdrawn their participation from the trial (n=2). These pupils were from a number of intervention and control schools where other pupils took the post-test. Please refer to the ‘follow-up’ section of Figure 2. Finally, there were some pupils for whom we had post-test data but no prior attainment data. We excluded these from the primary analysis. Therefore, overall, the primary analysis involved 501 pupils from 69 intervention schools and 505 pupils from 72 control schools. On average, there were seven pupils per school, with some schools with two pupils and other schools with twelve pupils. Overall, 1,006 pupils were retained in the analysis out of 1,217 pupils who were meant to be followed up. This resulted in an overall pupil attrition to be 17%.
