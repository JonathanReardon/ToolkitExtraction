Students in the PALS and control groups received the same amount of reading instruction during the 13 weeks of the study. The PALS group received supplemental PALS reading instruction in addition to the district curriculum while the control group used only the district reading curriculum. Quantitative data were collected from pre and post-test measures for reading comprehension (Scholastic Reading Inventory and DIBELS Daze), fluency (DIBELS ORF), and attitude toward reading (Elementary Reading Attitude Survey). Qualitative data were collected in the form of reflection posts from an online site called Kidblog, and a teacher interview protocol. Findings did not reveal any statistical difference in reading comprehension, fluency, or attitude between PALS and control groups.

Current studies are sparse, indicating that Mentor Programs may improve self-concept, but empirical assessments are lacking. This study investigated the efficacy of a mentor model on self-concept and achievement variables of intermediate school underachievers. A Mentor Program model was implemented with an experimental group of 55 underachieving students in a Fairfax County, Virginia, intermediate school. A 42 student control group of underachievers in another Fairfax County intermediate school were monitored. Forty education staff members served as mentors to the experimental group of students. The study was of a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design. Primary measurement instruments used were the Self-Concept and Motivation Inventory (SCAMIN), an appropriate measure of self-concept in the school setting, the Grade Point Average (GPA), the standard measure of academic achievement, and the Failure Rate, including students retentions and classes failed. Four research questions were investigated. For testing overall effects of the treatment/Mentor Program at the school level, a Value Added Analysis was performed. For testing the hypotheses, the following analyses were undertaken  ANCOVAs were performed on the achievement data  t-tests and ANOVAs were performed on the self-concept data, Chi-square, t-test, and ANOVA were performed on the failure data. Canonical Correlation Analysis was performed to explain the relationship between the predictor measures and the criterion measures. Descriptive and ethnographic information in the form of quantitative and qualitative data analyses added to the breadth of the assessment. Results revealed that the Mentor Program produced positive, nonsignificant gains at the experimental school. The gains were better than those at the control school, but not significantly better. Analysis of the results also disclosed changes in the study design should be considered for future research. Recommendations include two year assessments, multiple school comparisons, and longitudinal studies.

The main objective of strategy instruction is to foster comprehension monitoring. The study examined whether reciprocal teaching methods (strategy instruction) were superior to traditional methods of remedial reading (skill acquisition) in large intact high school remedial classes. This setting was chosen because it is a more natural setting for the implementation of reciprocal teaching than settings used in previous studies. With a methodology similar to that used in the pioneering work of Palincsar and Brown (1984), 53 students in five intact reading classes who received strategy instruction were compared to 22 students in three control-group classes.

39253274,Allen (2003),2003,"This study examined the impact of an 18-day, 54-hour Summer Literacy Clinic (SLC) designed to increase the knowledge of kindergarten students identified at-risk for reading failure. The SLC provided small group instruction for struggling kindergartners in phonological awareness (sound), print awareness, letter-sound knowledge (sound and print), and language. The subjects included 30 at-risk students and 50 regular classroom students from two K–4 schools in rural northeastern Alabama. Of the 30 students identified as at-risk, 18 (intervention group) attended the SLC and 12 (control group) did not attend. The students in the regular classroom group varied. Pretest data indicated that the control and intervention children were significantly lower than the students in the regular classroom group. Posttesting revealed literacy growth for both the control and intervention group children. Posttest data also indicated that there was no significant difference between the three groups on several foundational literacy concepts. Unexpectedly, the control group children gained sufficient literacy knowledge to perform as well as the intervention group children on most posttests. It should be noted that an influencing factor, an in-school tutoring program, was provided to children who continued to struggle from both the control and intervention groups prior to November posttesting. The intervention children did however show superior performance over the students in the control and regular classroom groups on some retelling measures (number of words, use of attributive adjectives, and prepositional phrases). These results indicated that the SLC provided sufficient exposure to a variety of genre through read alouds and classroom discussions to positively impact the language performance of the students in the interventional group. Based on low pretest performance of the 30 at-risk students, many were not expected to reach November benchmarks. Nonetheless, the intervention and control group children increased their literacy knowledge to a level that allowed them to meet first grade benchmarks. The study highlighted the necessity of long-term intervention for at-risk children. Both the SLC and in-school tutoring program seemed to support the literacy growth of these children, even though they were unable to reach the performance level of their more fortunate classroom peers.",['Summer schools'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '5']",NA,NA,,2,"['Page 81:\n[¬s]"" The participants involved in this study attended Stevenson and Bridgeport Elementary Schools,[¬e]""']",,,2,NA,,2,"['Page 81:\n[¬s]""The participants involved in this study attended Stevenson and Bridgeport Elementary Schools,[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,1,"['Page 85:\n[¬s]""Thirty children, 18 males and 12 females, were identified as at risk from a group o f 90 kindergarten students[¬e]""']",,1,,"['Page 85:\n[¬s]"" Thirty children, 18 males and 12 females, were identified as at risk from a group o f 90 kindergarten students[¬e]""']",1,"['Page 85:\n[¬s]"" Thirty children, 18 males and 12 females, were identified as at risk from a group o f 90 kindergarten students [¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Not assigned - naturally occurring sample,"['Page 80:\n[¬s]""The data generated from the at-risk kindergarten\nstudents who attended the Summer Literacy (intervention group) was compared to the\ndata generated from the at-risk kindergartners who did not attend the Summer Literacy\nClinic (control group).[¬e]""']",NA,,N,NA,NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 80:\n[¬s]""Thirty kindergarten students were identified as at-risk and were involved in this study.

The subjects in this study were eighth-grade general math students in three middle schools. The classrooms included students with disabilities and students at risk of math failure. The procedure for this study consisted of four phases, including teacher inservice, student training, implementation, and posttreatment. Treatment groups (CWPT & independent practice) were determined to have no preexisting differences. Analysis included the use of a repeated measures 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment group (CWPT & independent practice), student level (at risk & not at risk), and time (pretest & posttest) to determine whether any significant differences were present among the levels of the experimental conditions. Significant differences from pretest to posttest were found for all groups demonstrating that, overall, students significantly improved their algebra problem-solving performance. No significant differences were found from pretest to posttest between treatment groups (CWPT & independent practice) or between at-risk groups (at risk & not at risk). The one exception to this trend between treatment groups was that for students age 14 and 15 those students using CWPT performed better than students using independent practice. No significant differences were found from posttest to maintenance test between treatment groups or at-risk groups, indicating that students in all groups retained what they had learned after 1 week of no algebra instruction. No significant interaction effects were found, meaning performance was not dependent on treatment group, at-risk classification, or any combination of the two variables. Students indicated that they liked using CWPT, while teachers generally liked it, but several teachers complained that CWPT required much teacher energy due to continual monitoring.

40307267,Anderberg (1996),1996,"Increases in the limited English proficient (LEP) population in United States public school classrooms (Garcia, 1994) result in a need for effective instructional programs in reading comprehension. This study addressed this need. Reciprocal teaching has been recognized as an effective method for the improvement of reading comprehension in children who can decode but who experience difficulty understanding text (Palincsar & Brown, 1984). Little research is available to assess whether this increasingly popular strategy, recommended for poor readers, is also useful for the Limited English Proficient (LEP) student (Brady, 1990  Casanave, 1988  Hernandez, 1991). Reciprocal teaching encourages student initiated prediction, clarification, question generation and summarization. It is currently under consideration by bilingual researchers as a method of strategy instruction for improving LEP reading comprehension. Strategy instruction is one of the approaches that has resulted from investigations in schema theory and metacognition studies. Students receive training in four strategies that relate to skilled comprehension and comprehension monitoring. This study examined the effects of reciprocal teaching methods on reading comprehension scores with mainstream and LEP students. Two comparison groups of fourth-grade students were the subjects of the study. Students in eight classes received 16 sessions of reciprocal teaching or reading practice (control condition) delivered by their regular classroom teachers. A pre-test post-test control group design was used. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the research hypotheses. Results from the ANCOVA showed no significant improvement in reading comprehension for either the the control or the experiment group. Likewise the research yielded no evidence of a significant difference between bilingual and monolingual students in later reading comprehension.

All students in this class were brought to an 85% correct level of achievement in each unit (85ML Class). The second strategy was a mastery learning strategy (see above) in which all students were brought to a 75% correct level of achievement in each unit (75ML Class). The third strategy was a conventional teaching-learning strategy in which students read the programmed text on each unit, were given a test over that unit, and moved on to the next unit (CONV Class). Students learned three sequential units of matrix arithmetic in a programmed text format. The material was developed by Block (1970). Prior to the experiment, students were administered a pre-test on matrix arithmetic. Further, prior to each learning unit students were asked how interesting they thought the unit would be and how well they thought they would do on the unit. The experiment proceeded as follows. All three classes read unit one of their programmed texts. After they had finished they took a formative test. After the formative test was corrected, those students in the 75ML and 85ML classes who did not attain their appropriate per cent correct were given additional time and help in order to correct their mistakes. The conventional class, on the other hand, was finished with that particular unit. After the students in the two mastery classes corrected their mistakes, they were given a review test over the number of problems that they had incorrect initially which, when done correctly, would bring them up to the criterion level. The learning proceeded in the same manner for all three units. Each day one, and only one, unit was covered. Following the experiment, a summative post-test was given to all three classes. In both the naturalistic and the experimental study achievement was measured by tests based on the content which was covered during the period of time during which the study was conducted. When corrected multiple correlations were used to investigate the relationship of the composite of the antecedent variables and time-on-task, the antecedent variables account for between 25% and 67% of the variation in time-on-task. Since, however, only one, or at most two, of the three antecedent variables could be corrected for attenuation before being placed in the multiple regression analysis it is believed that the findings represent an underestimate of the relationship between the antecedent variables and time-on-task.

50307044,Anderson (2006),2006,"All youth are not afforded the same opportunities in their natural environments to promote positive mental health and develop competencies. To address this rising concern, the inequities in service distribution, and the personnel limitations inherent in school systems, the use of mentors has recently been promoted. However, mentoring programs are fairly new and diverse and support for these programs is based on inconsistent results and methodologically flawed research. A program consisting of nonprofessional mentors and a problem solving skills training component was developed for the present study. It was hypothesized that this would expand the reach of mental health professionals and be an effective, cost-efficient method of intervention and prevention. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the addition of a structured problem solving component would enhance the positive effects of a standard mentoring program on maladaptive behavior, adaptive behavior, and problem solving skills with at-risk youth. Conditions included problem solving focused mentoring (PSFM), standard mentoring (SM), and wait-list control. Sixty youth in fourth and fifth grade from an economically disadvantaged, predominantly minority community served as mentees. Mentees were referred by school personnel as children ""at-risk"" due to externalizing, internalizing, or learning/educational problems. As hypothesized, the positive change from pretest to post-test on mentee self-report of school interest for the SM group was significantly different from the negative change demonstrated by the control group. A significant difference was found between the SM and control groups and the SM and PSFM groups regarding the pretest to post-test change of teacher rated mentee assertiveness, but not in the hypothesized direction. Specifically, the PSFM group remained the same and the SM and control groups indicated a decrease in assertiveness, with this decrease significantly greater for the SM group as compared to the control group. Contrary to what was hypothesized, absences increased on average for the PSFM group and this increase was significantly greater than the change in absences for the SM group and control group. No differences were demonstrated between the groups on pretest to post-test changes regarding teacher rated peer social skills, mentee self-report of peer social skills, or academic performance.

Both programs involved games and creative activities. The writing program encouraged letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and functional writing activities. The reading program utilized 11 children's books for focusing on language and exploring major concepts raised by these books. Results indicated that children in the two literacy programs progressed significantly more than the control group on phonological awareness and orthographic awareness.

Firstly, whether or not the use of a mastery-based reading programme led to accelerated progress by an experimental group in contrast to the progress made by a comparison group. Secondly, whether the use of same-age tutoring prejudiced either high or low attainers (as assessed pre-trial). Pre and post-test reading test raw scores for experimental and comparison groups were analysed using an independent t-test. The experimental group outperformed the comparison group by a significant margin (p < .005).

Forty-eight reading deficient 4th and 5th graders were assigned to four conditions  Preskill Training  Preskill + Strategy Training  Preskill + Build-up Word Practice  and Monosyllabic Training. Students in the Preskill Training condition received 9 days of instruction on eight preskills derived from a text-based task analysis of multisyllabic word reading followed by 9 days of monosyllabic word reading. Preskill + Strategy Training consisted of Preskill Training followed by 9 days of instruction on a strategy for segmenting and decoding longer words. Training in the Preskill + Build-up Word Practice condition was similar  however, no strategy for segmenting words was introduced. Instead, the subjects read words with the word parts indicated by the instructor. In the final condition, Monosyllabic Training, 18 days of training were given on reading regular and irregular single syllable words in context and in isolation. Highly structured, direct instruction was used in all conditions.  The mean scores for the three intervention groups receiving training related to multisyllabic word reading were significantly higher on all outcome measures than those obtained by the Monosyllabic Training group. The experimental procedures were effective in improving the decoding skills of reading deficient 4th and 5th graders. The mean scores for the two groups receiving Preskill Training with additional practice in decoding multisyllabic words (Strategy Training or Build-up Word Practice) were significantly higher than those obtained by the Preskill Training group.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate effects of professional development of an experienced teacher, in an area of vocabulary development in a critical content area. The science teacher received 10 hours of training in specific vocabulary strategies. This training was followed by classroom observations of the science teacher to determine if new strategies for vocabulary instruction were integrated effectively in her content instruction. This study examined the possible impact of instructional modifications on student learning. Examination of the effect on students learning was analyzed by establishing a control and comparison group. The control group received the usual instruction in science and vocabulary  a second Vocabulary Enhanced group received normal science instruction that integrated specialized reading vocabulary skills with science terminology. All subjects (46 sixth graders) took a science unit test before and after the 10 weeks of instruction. An analysis of covariance was utilized to compare posttest achievement scores on the science unit test, using the science pretest scores and reading achievement scores as covariates.

Significant reading gains were shown by the class at the end of the experimental period when compared to a matched control group. The gains were not maintained when the children reverted back to individual silent reading. Before the programme the children had exhibited poor reading behaviours—whilst the class had a splintered social structure. During the programme the level of on-task reading behaviours rose considerably and more positive social behaviours were noted in the class with more friendliness, cohesion and co-operation between the children. The belief that the gains of the children informally acting as ‘tutors’ would be adversely affected by them helping their less able peers was not supported since the ‘tutors’ made more reading gain than the ‘tutees’.

Eighty-four beginning first grade students at risk of reading difficulties were randomly assigned to experimental and comparison groups. Adult volunteers tutored students in the experimental group in 30-minute sessions two times per week in first and second grade. At the end of grades 1 and 2, students were administered a number of standardized reading measures, including measures of individual word reading, reading comprehension, word comprehension, and reading fluency. Analyses revealed that students in the experimental group made greater growth on a word identification measure than students in the comparison condition  they also made more growth than a group of average-achieving students who were from the same classrooms as the students in the experimental and comparison groups. Students in the experimental group also scored higher than students in the comparison condition on measures of reading fluency and word comprehension at the end of second grade. Differences were not statistically significant on passage comprehension. Findings are discussed in the context of the reading achievement effects that other adult volunteer reading programs have attained. We suggest that in establishing adult volunteer reading programs it is important to consider how to balance the intensity of training reading volunteers to achieve measurable impact on reading achievement with real world realities of the volunteer tutoring experience and goals for the extensiveness of implementation.","['One to one tuition', 'Oral language interventions']",NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '8']",NA,NA,,6,"['Page 8:\n[¬s]"".

Fifty-four eighth grade students with learning disabilities were stratified by sex and randomly assigned to one of three conditions  (a) text structure-based strategy  (b) paragraph restatement strategy  or (c) traditional instruction. The text structure-based strategy condition taught students to identify three types of passages  main idea, list, and order, and to apply passage-type specific reading strategies. Prior to instruction all students were administered a pre-instruction strategy survey. All students received three consecutive days of condition-specific, individual instruction and were administered immediate, delayed, and transfer tests of reading comprehension. On the fourth day, students were required to read and study unfamiliar science passages independently and were asked to recall science information from those passages. On the fifth day, a delayed test of science content was administered  students read and studied unfamiliar social studies passages and were asked to recall social studies information  and a post-instruction strategy survey was administered. Performance on each test was scored for the number of central and incidental idea units recalled, using both conservative and less conservative scoring procedures. Results indicated that the text structure-based reading strategy had a significant effect on recall of central and incidental information over traditional instruction on immediate, delayed, and transfer tests, and had significant effects on recall of central, but not incidental information over the paragraph restatement strategy on all measures. Moreover, the paragraph restatement condition statistically outperformed the measures. Moreover, the paragraph restatement condition statistically outperformed the traditional instruction condition on all measures. Parallel findings on all analyses were obtained whether conservative or less conservative scoring procedures were used.

The independent variables included summer school participation, gender, SES, and ethnicity. The dependent variables included the student post-test NWEA MAP scores in each of three subject areas (language usage, reading, and math) for each grade level (2–5), in each year of the study. The covariates included the student pre-test NWEA MAP scores in each of the same subject areas and grade levels for each year of the study. Study participants were convenience samples of summer school students and their non-summer school counterparts in grades 2–5 from multiple elementary school sites within a single school district in northeast Indiana. As summer school programming remained the same for each year of the study, scores from each of the five years were combined for analysis according to subject and grade level to lend an overall perspective. For language usage, data was collected for 850 matched pairs of students. For math, there were 828 matched pairs. The study also included 853 matched pairs of students for reading. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) at the .05 probability level ( p=.05) was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between student post-test scores for summer school participants and their non-summer school counterparts, while controlling for gender, SES, and ethnicity. In order to isolate the effects of summer school for each grade level (2–5), there were 4 separate analyses, one for each elementary grade level, and 3 sub-analyses within each grade level – reading, language usage and math–leading to a total of 12 sets of ANCOVA analyses. The results of ANCOVA analysis showed a significant interaction effect between summer school participation and SES for both language usage and math in grade 2. However, there were no significant interaction effects or main effects of the independent variables on post-test reading scores for second graders. For third grade, ANCOVA analysis showed a significant interaction effect between summer school participation and SES for language usage. Participation in summer school was shown to have a significant main effect on post-test reading scores with summer school students scoring significantly lower than their non-summer school counterparts. In grade four, ANCOVA analysis revealed a significant interaction effect between summer school participation and gender for language usage. SES showed a significant main effect on post-test math scores, with paid lunch students performing significantly better than their free/reduced lunch peers for both summer school and non-summer school student groups. Participation in summer school was shown to have a significant main effect on post-test reading scores in fourth grade, with summer school students scoring significantly lower than their non-summer school counterparts. For grade five language usage students, each of the main effects of gender, ethnicity, and SES were statistically significant. Ethnicity was shown to have a significant main effect on post-test math scores with White students scoring significantly higher than students of all other ethnicities, regardless of participation in summer school. There were no significant interaction effects or main effects of the independent variables on post-test reading scores for fifth graders. These results indicate a need of review, revision, and refinement at all grade levels (2–5) and in all subjects (language usage, math, and reading) of the summer remediation programming within the study in order to effectively serve the needs of its stud nts.

40134223,Barkley (2000),2000,"Annual screenings of preschool children at kindergarten registration identified 158 children having high levels of aggressive, hyperactive, impulsive, and inattentive behavior. These ―disruptive‖ children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year  no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains  parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother–child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children. Even so, most treatment effects were specific to the school environment and did not affect achievement skills.

40117110,Barron (1993),1993,"This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between a single-track year-round school and a traditional calendar school regarding student achievement, student attendance, and teacher attendance in a bilingual community. A two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to assess the statistical significance of achievement data. The achievement areas were used as dependent variables. If a significant difference occurred, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed. If a significant difference across the years or a significant interaction were found, a Tukey a posteriori test was computed to reflect where the differences occurred. At Grade 5, students were tested in English using the CTBS. Traditional school students outperformed the year-round students in reading, language, and mathematics. At Grade 2, students were tested in Spanish using the SABE. Traditional school students showed a progressive drop in reading and mathematics while year-round students showed continued improvement. Student attendance data for tardies, unexcused absences, and excused absences were analyzed. The traditional students had decreasing tardies during the 4 years of the study, while tardies for the year-round students increased. The traditional students had significantly fewer unexcused absences than the year-round students and significantly more excused absences. Teachers from the two types of schools did not significantly differ in attendance rates and rates did not differ by the year in which the data were gathered. The conclusions from this study are  (1) The relationship between achievement and the type of school calendar depends, in part, on the language of instruction and on when the analysis is done. (2) Grade 5 students in the traditional calendar school achieved significantly higher than students in the year-round school. (3) Grade 2 students achieved significantly higher in the traditional calendar school during the first year of the study and significantly lower than year-round students during the third year. (4) Excused absences were significantly higher in the traditional school. (5) Unexcused absences were significantly higher in the year-round school.

Sixty-six fourth-grade students were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups  (a) a Think-Aloud (TA) group, in which students were taught various comprehension monitoring strategies for reading stories (e.g., self-questioning, prediction, retelling, rereading) through the medium of thinking aloud  (b) a Directed Reading-Thinking Activity (DRTA) group, in which students were taught a predict-verify strategy for reading and responding to stories  or (c) a Directed Reading Activity (DRA) group, an instructed control, in which students engaged in a noninteractive, guided reading of stories. The primary quantitative analyses involved two planned orthogonal contrasts—effect of instruction (TA + DRTA vs. 2 x DRA) and intensity of instruction (TA vs. DRTA)—for three whole-sample dependent measures  (a) an error detection test, (b) a comprehension monitoring questionnaire, and (c) a modified cloze test. Results of effect of instruction contrasts revealed that TA and DRTA students were more skillful at comprehension monitoring than DRA students (TA + DRTA>DRA for all three measures). Results of intensity of instruction contrasts indicated that although TA-trained students had greater awareness of comprehension monitoring abilities (TA>DRTA for the questionnaire), DRTA students' performance equaled (TA = DRTA for the cloze test) or exceeded (TA<DRTA for the error detection test) that of the TA students. Qualitative data from student interviews, however, revealed that TA students both reported and demonstrated using a greater depth and breadth of comprehension monitoring abilities than either DRTA or DRA students. It was concluded that both TA and DRTA strategies are effective for enhancing elementary students' comprehension monitoring abilities but that additional research is needed to determine the relative effectiveness of TA and DRTA approaches. © 1992, SAGE Publications.

Student-reported disaffectionwith learning and academic grades, and teacher ratings of academic ability and motivation were assessed for a cohort followedfrom grades 3 to 8. Aggregate school records were used to assess standardized test performance (for entire school, cohort, anddemographic subgroups) and absenteeism (entire school). Multilevel growth-curve analyses tested program effects.RESULTS PA significantly improved growth in academic motivation and mitigated disaffection with learning. There was apositive impact of PA on absenteeism and marginally significant impact on math performance of all students. There werefavorable program effects on reading for African American boys and cohort students transitioning between grades 7 and 8, andon math for girls and low-income students.CONCLUSIONS A school-based SECD program was found to influence academic outcomes among students living inlow-income, urban communities.

42059739,Beach (2004),2004,"Although there is considerable evidence linking phonological awareness to early reading performance, few research studies have been conducted to measure early interventions of explicit phonological awareness instruction, including parents as teachers, with 4- and 5-year-old prekindergarten children  among those that have been completed, research methods have often been seriously flawed. The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.","['Parental engagement', 'Phonics', 'Summer schools']",NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],"['Page 55:\n[¬s]""The independent variable in this study was the LCSD Kindergarten\nReadiness Summer Program.

43099917,Beattie (2000),2000,"There is a large body of research that implicates difficulty with phonological processing as the fundamental deficit in many children with reading and language impairments. Research indicates that difficulty with the ability to discriminate acoustic information that enters the nervous system in rapid succession (within a time frame of milliseconds) interferes with the development of phonological processes (Tallal, Miller, & Fitch, 1993). This temporal processing deficit may result in more global language impairments, such as receptive language disorders and reading disabilities.  This experimental study examined the effects of two intensive computer-based language interventions on receptive language, phonemic awareness, reading, and spelling achievement. One language intervention is called Fast ForWord (FF), a CD-ROM and Internet-based training program developed to increase students' ability to process rapid, successive acoustic information and understand spoken language. Fast ForWord is based on twenty years of research in neural plasticity and language impairments. Fast ForWord was compared to a language arts computer-based intervention, SuccessMaker (SM). SuccessMaker employs direct reading and spelling exercises and practice.  This study contrasted the effectiveness of the two intervention approaches with sixty-four adolescents from three local school divisions. ANOVA and ANCOVA procedures were used to examine the effects of FF and SM, as well as combinations of SM and FF on measures of receptive language, phonemic awareness reading, and spelling. A control group was used for further comparison.  While no statistically significant results were found between groups, issues with treatment compliance may have affected participants, ability to benefit from intervention.

Year-round education in the South Bay Union School District was implemented to meet student population growth, with the potential of returning to a traditional calendar when those growth needs are met. The problem this study addresses is the possible impact of year-round education on academic achievement and whether there has been acceptable academic growth to continue year-round education programs. Procedures. The population of this study consisted of third grade students (N = 525), in eight elementary schools in the South Bay Union School District, that took the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, Form-U in May, 1989 and May, 1990. The researcher of this study collected data from the cumulative folders of analysis units from six multi-track year-round education (YRE) and two traditional calendar schools. Data were entered into a computer and were analyzed using Number Cruncher Statistical Systems (NCSS 4.2). Findings. The findings of this study were as follows  Using ANOVA, a significant difference (at 0.5) between pre and post tests was demonstrated by all eight schools within this study. Using four separate ANOVAs the four school types were examined pair-wise. With the exception of schools in their third year of YRE, homogeneity was evident within all school types (two years in YRE, one year in YRE, and traditional calendar). With respect to the ANOVA, three-year YRE are significantly different from two-year and one-year YRE but not traditional schools  and, traditional schools differ significantly from only one-year YRE schools. In examining the impact of potential covariates, it was found that the covariate, number of years a student was in attendance in YRE, was not significant. When that covariate was dropped from the analysis the only significant difference was still across the school types. ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Fishers' Least Significant Difference (LSD) statistical analyses found a consistent pattern throughout the observations. As a group, the YRE schools demonstrated greater mean score gains than the traditional schools. Both first and second year YRE schools displayed greater gains than the traditional calendar schools. Compared to third year YRE schools, the traditional calendar schools displayed a higher, although not significant difference in mean score gains.",['Extending school time'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '8']",NA,NA,,6,"['Page 47:\n[¬s]"" six m ulti-track YRE schools[¬e]""']",,,2,"['Page 47:\n[¬s]""two\ntraditional calendar schools[¬e]""']",,8,"['Page 57:\n[¬s]""eight schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],Not provided,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Retrospective Quasi Experimental Design (QED),"['Page 47:\n[¬s]""T he third grade student in six m ulti-track YRE schools and two traditional calendar schools in the SBUSD com prise the population for this study.[¬e]""']",NA,,School - cluster,"['Page 47:\n[¬s]""T he third grade student in six m ulti-track YRE schools and two traditional calendar schools in the SBUSD com prise the population for this study.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 54:\n[¬s]""This study is a quasi-experimental design [¬e]""']",NA,,Not applicable,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

50752646,Benner (2004),2004,"The central purpose addressed for this dissertation study was to examine the effects of an intensive early literacy support program on the phonological processing skills of kindergarten children at-risk of EBD. Some research suggests that these children do not improve from generally effective early literacy support interventions. As a result, these children have recently been described as treatment resisters-children who fail to acquire phonological processing skills within the normal range after treatment. But the conclusion that children at-risk of EBD are treatment resisters may be premature due to the methodological and design limitations of previous research. The primary purpose of this dissertation was to investigate the effects of an intensive early literacy support program on the phonological processing skills of kindergarten children at-risk of EBD using a true experimental design. A total of 36 kindergarten children at-risk of EBD participated in this study. The 36 children were assigned randomly to either the experimental ( n = 18) or control (n = 18) condition. Children in the experimental condition received an early literacy support program for 10 to 15 minutes daily over five weeks. Three primary dependent measures were used in this study  the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP) (Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999)  the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) (Kaminski & Good, 1996)  and treatment fidelity measures.

37671594,Bennett (2013),2013,"This study evaluated the impact of a computerized visuospatial memory training intervention on the memory and behavioral skills of children with Down syndrome. Teaching assistants were trained to support the delivery of a computerized intervention program to individual children over a 10-16 week period in school. Twenty-one children aged 7-12 years with Down syndrome were randomly allocated to either an intervention or waiting list control group. Following training, performance on trained and non-trained visuospatial short-term memory tasks was significantly enhanced for children in the intervention group. This improvement was sustained four months later. These results suggest that computerized visuospatial memory training in a school setting is both feasible and effective for children with Down syndrome.

Teachers were randomly assigned to training condition and implemented 12 thirty minute lessons during self-contained English or accelerated reading classes. Strategy instruction consisted of instruction for the strategies  (a) setting a purpose, (b) previewing text structures, (c) activating background knowledge, (d) self-questioning, (e) summarizing, and (f) strategy monitoring. Attribution training consisted of instruction in the concepts  (a) identifying self-promoting (positive) and self-defeating (negative) beliefs, (b) using positive self-talk with simple and complex scenarios, and (c) using positive self-talk to promote persistence and flexible strategy use  in addition, teacher feedback was designed to promote explicit connections between strategy use and success or failure with comprehension. The Read Naturally condition consisted of instruction using either the traditional or computerized version of the program. Statistically significant findings were found for those students receiving reading comprehension strategy instruction and reading comprehension strategy instruction with attribution retraining over those in the Read Naturally condition on recall of main idea information. In addition, there were statistically significant findings for students who received reading comprehension strategy instruction over those in the Read Naturally condition. There were not, however statistically significant effects for students in the reading comprehension plus attribution training condition, although there was a descriptive advantage in the predicted direction.

40117239,Berninger (2006),2006,"Two studies of second graders at risk for reading disability, which were guided by levels of language and functional reading system theory, focused on reading comprehension in this population. In Study 1 (n = 96), confirmatory factor analysis of five comprehension measures loaded on one factor in both fall and spring of second grade. Phonological decoding predicted accuracy of real-word reading  automatic letter naming predicted rate of real-word reading  accuracy and rate of both real-word reading (more so than decoding of pseudowords) and text reading predicted reading comprehension  and Verbal IQ also predicted reading comprehension. In Study 2 (n = 98), the treatment group (before/after school clubs receiving an integrated instructional approach that was supplementary to the general reading program) improved significantly more in phonological decoding and state standards for reading fluency than the control group (general reading program that had some code instruction but emphasized commmprehension). The rate of phonological decoding explained 60.3% of real-word reading. Both treatment and control children improved significantly in reading comprehension, but controlling for pretreatment individual differences in oral vocabulary or in phonological decoding eliminated this effect. Taken together, the results of the two studies support two paths to reading comprehension  one from vocabulary and verbal reasoning, and one from written language that has multiple links between subskills  (a) alphabetic principle → phonological decoding, (b) automatic phonological decoding → accurate real-word reading, (c) automatic letter coding → automatic word reading, and (d) automatic word reading → fluent text reading.

The results contribute to knowledge of research-supported handwriting and composing instruction that informs practice as school psychologists are empowered to embrace the role of intervention specialist. The first study found that neurodevelopmental training (orthographic-free motor activities and motor-free orthographic activities) led to improved accuracy and legibility of letter formation, but that direct handwriting instruction with visual cues and verbal mediation led to improved automatic handwriting (rate of writing legible letters) and transfer to improved word reading. The second study found that neither motor training nor orthographic training alone added value to direct instruction in automatic letter writing and composing practice in developing handwriting skills, which transferred to improved word reading  but the added motor training did improve performance on a grapho-motor planning task for sequential finger movements that is relevant to composing. A related analysis showed that direct instruction with visual cues and memory delays may reduce reversals. A third study found that adding handwriting to reading instruction improved handwriting but did not add value to reading outcomes for at risk readers  reading instruction alone was beneficial for word reading, decoding, and comprehension. The fourth study showed that comprehensive, explicit instruction in the processes of composition led to more significant improvement, based on group and individual data, than did the regular fourth grade program, on high stakes writing assessment. © 2006 Society for the Study of School Psychology.

40375880,Bernstein (2009),2009,"This report summarizes the findings from a national evaluation of mentoring programs funded under the U.S. Department of Education's Student Mentoring Program. The impact evaluation used an experimental design in which students were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Thirty-two purposively selected School Mentoring Programs and 2,573 students took part in the evaluation, which estimated the impact of the programs over one school year on a range of student outcomes. The evaluation also describes the characteristics of the program and the mentors, and provides information about program delivery. The Student Mentoring Program is designed to fund grantees to enable them to provide mentoring to at-risk students in grades 4-8. The ultimate goal of the program is to improve student academic and behavioral outcomes through the guidance and encouragement of a volunteer mentor. Seventeen total impacts in the domains of academic achievement/engagement, interpersonal relationships/personal responsibility, and high-risk/delinquent behavior were measured. The main finding of the Impact Study was that there were no statistically significant impacts of the Student Mentoring Program for the sample as a whole on this array of student outcomes. However, there was some scattered evidence that impacts were heterogeneous across types of students. In particular, impacts on girls were statistically significantly different from impacts on boys for two self-reported scales  Scholastic Efficacy and School Bonding, and Pro-social Behaviors. For boys, the impact on Prosocial Behaviors was negative and statistically significant. For girls, the impact on Scholastic Efficacy and School Bonding was positive and statistically significant. The impact on truancy was negative and statistically significant for students below age 12. There were negative associations between program supervision of mentors and site-level impacts on three of the seventeen individual outcome measures  Pro-social Behaviors, grades in math and social studies, and a positive relationship with the outcome of school-reported delinquency. The report also presented results demonstrating that the Student Mentoring Program represented a fairly low level of intensity in terms of service  although grantees, on average, adhered to the general intents of the legislation and program guidance, they were simultaneously constrained by the limits of the school calendar and the population from which to draw mentors. Thirty-five percent of the control group students reported receiving mentoring either from the program or elsewhere in the community  this finding, coupled with the fact that not all treatment group students met with a mentor, reduced the treatment contrast and may have led to some dilution of the impacts on students compared to expectations.

Over 9,000 kindergarten children at 4 sites in 3 cohorts were screened, and 891 were identified as high risk and then randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Beginning in Grade 1, high-risk children and their parents were asked to participate in a combination of social skills and anger-control training, academic tutoring, parent training, and home visiting. A multiyear universal classroom program was delivered to the core schools attended by these high-risk children. By the end of third grade, 37% of the intervention group was determined to be free of serious conduct-problem dysfunction, in contrast with 27% of the control group. Teacher ratings of conduct problems and official records of use of special education resources gave modest effect-size evidence that the intervention was preventing conduct problem behavior at school.

This investigation examined whether or not the Junior Great Books approach enhanced critical reading skills, critical thinking skills, attitude toward reading, whether sex or previous experience with Junior Great Books affected these variables, and whether there was any relationship among the variables. The top level fifth grade readers in four socioeconomically similar schools participated in this study. One group had a basal program, one group had a mixed program of Junior Great Books part-time with basal and teacher-designed reading activities, and a third group had Junior Great Books as a full-time reading program.

After the Program's completion, each group was given the Estes and Ross tests again, along with the Worden Critical Thinking/Reading Appraisal.

40134170,Blackburn (2007),2007,"According to educational researchers, reading interventions on the elementary level are not being continued at the middle school, and many traditional methods of instructing adolescents who read below grade level are found to be ineffective. Group counseling programs have demonstrated social, emotional, and academic improvements for students who struggle academically. However, research in this area has been insufficient, particularly at the middle school level. A social constructivist counseling approach to group therapy was theorized to be a powerful tool in working with middle school students who read below grade level because it recognizes each student's unique reality and utilizes social learning through peer interaction. This research study focused on 162 students in a suburban Midwest school in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. A pre-test post-test control group experimental design with stratified random sampling was utilized, and data was analyzed through Analysis of Covariance. The social constructivist counseling program was implemented for eight weeks with the treatment groups on each grade level during the third quarter of the school year. Dependent variables included student grade point averages, reading test scores, attendance, homework completion, a self-esteem scale, and a behavior evaluation scale. Of these six dependent variables, statistically significant results were found between the treatment and control groups in four areas, namely homework completion, reading test scores, a behavior scale, and self-esteem. While significant results were not found in the area of grade point averages, the treatment group did improve their grades. Demographic information of student grades, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and reading class placement was tested by ANOVA and ANCOVA to determine if grade level data could be combined and if demographic variables were significant between groups. These results were not significant. This research presented the opportunity to explore an area of school counseling that has received insufficient empirical research.

The instructional approaches evaluated included Basal, Basal plus Phonics, i.t.a., Linguistic, Language Experience, and Phonic/Linguistic. Identical information was gathered in each project concerning teacher, school, and community characteristics and common experimental guidelines were followed in all 27 studies. Results of the correlation analysis revealed that the ability to recognize letters of the alphabet prior to the beginning of reading instruction was the single best predictor of first-grade reading achievement. The analysis of methodology indicated that the various non-basal instructional programs tended to be superior to basal programs as measured by word recognition skills of pupils after one year of reading instruction. Differences between basal and non-basal programs were less consistent when measures of comprehension, spelling, rate of accuracy of reading, and word study skills constituted the criterion of reading achievement.

The reciprocal teaching group (RT) learned the four reciprocal teaching activities of questioning, summarizing, clarifying, and predicting developed by Palincsar. The semantic mapping and reciprocal teaching group (SMART) received the same instruction as the RT group plus instruction in two semantic mapping strategies. The control group was taught none of these strategies. The training occurred over a period of twenty-five days. The instructor provided explicit instruction and modeling during the introductory phase, supportive scaffolding as students began to practice the strategies, and gradually faded out of participation by the conclusion of the study. The eighteen students were bilingual Alaska Natives from a rural village in southwest Alaska. Reading ability, as measured on a standardized achievement test, was generally low. One student read at grade level, and the others were two or more grades below grade level. The study used an experimental control group design with measurement of student achievement during baseline, instruction, maintenance, and three-month follow-up. Students' reading performance was measured on daily comprehension tests, Gates-MacGinitie reading tests, and generalization probes in both science and social studies. The experiment resulted in three major findings. First, comparisons between the patterns of growth for the two instructional groups revealed no significant differences on any measure. Second, comparisons between the growth pattern of the combined instructional groups and that of the control group showed significant differences on all measures. The average growth for the instructional groups was 29% on the daily comprehension tests and more than a year on the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Comprehension Test. The third finding was varying patterns of improvement for students in low, medium, and high ability groups, depending on the measure.

Federally funded, STEP provides 14- and 15-year-olds with a paid summer experience that combines work, remediation in reading and math, and life skills instruction with an emphasis on responsible social and sexual attitudes and behavior. Participants spend two consecutive summers in the program. The first cohort consisted of 1,592 youths (each receiving $3.35 per hour). They were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups at five demonstration sites--Boston, Fresno, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon. In the posttest, the youths in the treatment group outscored their control group counterparts in both reading and math by approximately one quarter of a grade equivalent. The impact of participation varied as a function of sex, race, and site. Girls in the treatment group showed greater reading gains over their counterparts in the control group than did the boys. Sex was not as great a factor in the math scores, however. Hispanic youths showed the greatest gains, with Asians and Blacks deriving solid benefits as well. The impact of participation varied among the sites, with the most impact occurring in Boston and the least occurring in Portland. The program also appeared to result in changes in self-reported sexual behavior of boys, an effect unusual among pregnancy prevention programs.

Unfortunately, there is a sparcity of research on the factors that influence aptitude test scores with this age group or the effects of accelerated coursework on an aptitude test such as the SAT. This study was designed to assess growth in measured verbal and mathematical aptitude as a result of coursework offered to gifted students on an accelerated basis during an intensive summer program. The subjects were participants in a summer residential program offered by The Johns Hopkins University Center for the Advancement of Academically Talented Youth (CTY). They were seventh graders who had qualified for the program on the basis of their SAT scores in a Talent Search and who enrolled in a course in writing, foreign or classical languages, mathematics, or science. A control group included students who met the selection criteria but who did not participate in the program. A total of 244 students were included in the study. The SAT was administered to the students in the five groups following the summer program. Analyses of covariance were computed to determine differences in group performance on the SAT-M and SAT-V using the respective SAT scores from the Talent Search as covariates. A Scheffe test was used to test for pairwise comparisons of adjusted means. No effects were found on SAT-V for any of the courses investigated. The students who took mathematics or science scored higher on the SAT-M than the students who took writing or foreign languages, but the effect sizes were small, and no significant differences were found between the mathematics and science groups and the control group. These results suggest that specific knowledge of mathematical content as a result of the accelerated program did not contribute to improved performance on the SAT-M. No interaction effect between sex and treatment was found for SAT-M or SAT-V.

37133869,Bruno (2004),2004,"Classroom teachers often find it difficult to provide students with individualized instruction and attention. Research indicates that tutoring programs, when designed and implemented properly, can be of great benefit to the tutee and the tutor. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of participation in a cross-age tutoring program on the writing process behaviors, attitudes toward writing, writing confidence, and writing achievement of the students who acted as the tutors. Specifically, the following questions were explored  Did participation as a tutor in the cross-age program change the way that the fifth grade tutors approach the writing process when engaging in their own writing in terms of prewriting activities, revision strategies, and editing procedures? Did participation change the tutor's attitude toward writing? Did participation have an effect on the writing confidence level of the tutor? Did participation have an effect on the writing achievement of the tutor? Students in four kindergarten classes and four fifth grades (n = 80) from three different elementary schools in an eastern Pennsylvania school district comprised the partnership groups for a tutoring program. Four other fifth grade classes in the same district served as the control group (n = 79) for the study. This study incorporated both qualitative and quantitative research methods. A pretest-posttest control-group design with between group and within-group comparison was used. Statistical analysis of posttest scores on the Writer Self-Perception Scale (WSPS) (Bottomly, Henk, & Melnick, 1998) was done using a MANCOVA to measure attitudes toward writing and writing confidence. Four of the five WSPS subscales were shown to be significant at the 0.01 level. Writing samples were taken from the control and treatment groups pre and post program to examine changes in writing achievement. An ANCOVA indicated a significant gain for both the control and treatment groups. However, the treatment group showed a greater gain in the mean score (3.66) than the control group (1.65). Students were interviewed in order to explore the tutors' approach to the writing process regarding a sample.

Students involved in the study were third graders from a typical elementary school. Students who were identified special education students or who achieved an eighty percent mastery of the learning task as of the fourth, and last, posttest were excluded from the study. The computerized drill and practice was provided to the students over a two month period after regular classroom teachers instructed the students in multiplication facts based on addition skills already possessed by the students. Commercially available software was modified to provide the experimental treatments. Three levels of informational feedback  no feedback, knowledge of results only, and knowledge of results plus a corrective procedure leading the student to the correct response, were crossed with two levels of social reinforcement  no reinforcement and twenty percent variable ratio praise following correct student responses. A posttest-only experimental design employed a four minute, ninety item speed test given after each set of two iterations of the three hundred item drill and practice program. Learning progressed steadily throughout the experiment for all six treatment groups, and learning curves generally had low probabilities that their slopes could be zero. Inspection of these learning curves showed the feedback treatments clustered by levels while the reinforcement treatments did not. Analysis of variance revealed that a main effect developed for the feedback variable by the fourth posttest, which was reanalyzed using only feedback levels in the model. No such effect appeared for the reinforcement variable and there were no significant interactions. Planned comparisons of group means revealed that both knowledge of results in combination with the corrective procedure and no feedback produced significantly superior achievement than knowledge of results alone. While knowledge of results plus corrective procedure was superior to no feedback, the results did not reach significance.

The influence of a broad range of contextual factors were investigated, especially whether children's qualities, school factors such as socioeconomic status and class size, and delivery differences made significant differences to the outcomes of the different interventions. The study used a naturalistic quasi-experimental design, in which teachers were asked to record details of their children and interventions without altering their professional decisions, which has not been used before in investigating literacy difficulties in context.

37671542,Burgoyne (2012),2012,"Background  This study evaluates the effects of a language and literacy intervention for children with Down syndrome. Methods  Teaching assistants (TAs) were trained to deliver a reading and language intervention to children in individual daily 40-min sessions. We used a waiting list control design, in which half the sample received the intervention immediately, whereas the remaining children received the treatment after a 20-week delay. Fifty-seven children with Down syndrome in mainstream primary schools in two UK locations (Yorkshire and Hampshire) were randomly allocated to intervention (40 weeks of intervention) and waiting control (20 weeks of intervention) groups. Assessments were conducted at three time points  pre-intervention, after 20 weeks of intervention, and after 40 weeks of intervention. Results  After 20 weeks of intervention, the intervention group showed significantly greater progress than the waiting control group on measures of single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme blending and taught expressive vocabulary. Effects did not transfer to other skills (nonword reading, spelling, standardised expressive and receptive vocabulary, expressive information and grammar). After 40 weeks of intervention, the intervention group remained numerically ahead of the control group on most key outcome measures  but these differences were not significant. Children who were younger, attended more intervention sessions, and had better initial receptive language skills made greater progress during the course of the intervention. Conclusions  A TA-delivered intervention produced improvements in the reading and language skills of children with Down syndrome. Gains were largest in skills directly taught with little evidence of generalization to skills not directly taught in the intervention. (Contains 5 tables and 3 figures.)

The study attempted to help the researcher and the teachers understand how the students' perceptions of their ability are intertwined with their commitment to cognitive (thinking) strategies and their academic achievement. Another purpose of the study was to specify clear content goals, in order for the students to build a lucid mental image of the material in the social studies text, rather than merely memorizing disorganized facts. The average ability classes were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Group one received the reading strategy and attribution training. Group two was instructed in the reading comprehension strategy only. Group three was given attribution training only. Group four acted as the control group. The two teachers who participated in the study used their regular history books and taught the regularly scheduled topics of study, while incorporating the reading comprehension strategy and/or attribution training into their lessons. Subjects from all of the groups were randomly selected for interviews throughout the duration of the study. All subjects reported that if they paid attention in class, completed the worksheets, and studied hard, they should be able to improve their knowledge of social studies, they should be able to achieve better grades in social studies, and they would feel proud of themselves for their efforts. The combined treatment groups performed best, showing improvement in content knowledge. The strategy only and attribution only groups demonstrated slight improvements in content knowledge.

Both groups started the year with literacy levels below that of a 5-year-old. Comparison between the groups was made for reading and writing and phonic knowledge as well as oracy, work habits, social skills, and attitudes to learning. Those children who received Reading Recovery achieved significant gains in all assessments compared with those who did not. At the end of the year the children who had received Reading Recovery had an average reading age of 6 years 7 months, in line with their chronological age. The comparison group was 14 months behind, with an average reading age of 5 years 5 months. The study also evaluated classroom literacy.

39717127,Butler (1991) 1 1,1991,"An innovative integrated remedial reading program has been developed based on recent research findings. My longitudinal studies have revealed that poor reading compounds itself over the years. The majority of children with reading disabilities currently remain in regular classrooms with varying techniques being used depending upon individual school directives and current educational theory. Despite current remedial techniques, the poorer reader tends to remain so throughout the school years. Innovative techniques must be developed in the hope of altering this pattern. This paper presents one alternative strategy which can be used to upgrade reading skills and break the cycle of reading failure. The Reading Assistance Tutorial Pack (R.A.T. Pack) is a carefully sequenced series of activities that enables the learner to experience the motivating and reinforcing properties of success through all stages of phonetic and reading skills development. It is a systematic, multidisciplinary remedial reading program based on sound behavior, psycholinguistic and cognitive theories of learning—incorporating listening, speaking, seeing, writing, thinking, and comprehension skills. The R.A.T. Pack demands a high percentage of on-task behavior and trains phonological processing strategies. Functional language use is promoted through enjoyable activities involving sentence construction, cloze passages, puzzles, games, and other creative manipulations of the surface features of languages.

Cross-age tutoring refers to older students tutoring younger students. Studies of cross-age tutoring have reported improved academic performance for both tutors and tutees. The present study was conducted to determine the extent to which cross-age tutoring employed in a rural setting would produce outcomes similar to those reported in urban settings and in other countries. A between/within repeated measures experimental design was used to gauge the effects of cross-age tutoring on learning and retaining knowledge of fraction manipulations. Participating students were randomly assigned to one of four groups  tutors, tutees, nontutors, and nontutees. Tutors and nontutors were seventh- and eighth-grade students at one of two small elementary schools in the same rural district. Tutees and nontutees were third-, fourth-, or fifth-grade students attending the same rural elementary school. Analyses of both knowledge gain and retention scores revealed no significant differences in knowledge of fraction manipulations between tutors and nontutors, tutors and tutees, or tutees and nontutees.

It involved modeling and verbalization of cognitive activity to foster use of verbal mediation skills in dealing with both cognitive and interpersonal problems. It was hypothesized that this training would lead to improvement in test performance and teacher ratings of classroom behavior in hyperaggressive boys. Twelve aggressive second grade boys participated in daily, 30-minute, individual sessions for 6 weeks. Normal and aggressive control subjects received no intervention. Teachers rated both trained and untrained aggressive boys as improving in aggressive behaviors but they rated the experimental group as showing improvement on a sigmficantly larger number of prosocial behaviors. The pattern of performance on cognitive tests also changed significantly in the experimental group. On pretest, their pattern differed from normals and resembled the aggressive control group, while on posttest their pattern resembled normals and differed from aggressive controls.

One method was within-class-grouping which provided for organizing each class into three sub-groups ranging from the highest to the lowest in arithmetic achievement as indicated by achievement tests and teacher judgment. These were the experimental classes and the groups within these classes were designated Group I, Group II, and Group III. The other method was the whole-class-method in which there was no sub-grouping. Each class remained as originally scheduled and was taught as one complete group. The next step was to administer to these 220 pupils, in each school, the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test (verbal) and the Stanford Arithmetic Achievement Test, Form JM (Advanced), to obtain scores to use as a basis for establishing class sections.

The study was designed to answer three principle questions  First, will cross-age tutoring lead to measurable gains in reading and attitudes toward reading for first grade tutees? Second, will cross-age tutoring lead to measurable gains in reading and attitudes toward reading for third and fourth grade tutors? Third, will tutors who have received additional training in metacognition demonstrate measurable gains in reading achievement and attitudes towards reading as compared to tutors who have not received such training? Participants included 58 first and second grade children and 60 third and fourth grade students. Thirty third and fourth grade students were trained as Tutors. Tutors received five 40-minute tutor training sessions. Tutors were trained via teacher demonstration and role plays in tutoring practices including previewing, reading aloud, listening to repeated Tutee oral readings, giving feedback, charting partner's fluency and errors, and encouraging partner's retelling. Fifteen of the 30 Tutors received an additional week (five 40-minute sessions) of metacognitive instruction approximately half-way through the tutoring sessions. Each Tutor-Tutee pair was engaged in three tutoring sessions per week over the course of ten weeks during January, February, and March (approximately 30 sessions). Mean gain scores on reading achievement measures indicated no significant differences between Tutee Controls and Tutees on achievement measures following intervention. Mean gain scores on The Reader Attitude Inventory favored Tutee Controls. Mean gain scores indicated no significant differences between Tutor Controls and Tutors on the achievement or attitudes towards reading measures following intervention. Mean gain scores on reading achievement measures indicated no significant differences between Tutors and Metacognitively-Trained Tutors. Mean differences were shown on two of the four sub-scales on The Reader Self Perception Scale favoring the Tutors. Results of several qualitative measures showed some benefits. However, based on the evidence from this study, practitioners should carefully consider the required expenditures in time and effort of setting up and running a cross-age tutoring intervention when it is replacing classroom reading instruction.

Previous knowledge activation and diagrammatic representation of relations among text ideas were among the main strategies trained. 31 subjects (11 to 12 years-old) participated in the first study, and 104 (11 to 14 years-old) in the second one. In both cases, subjects were divided into two groups, experimental and control. Assessment was made through an interview carried out separately with two texts. Results reached statistical significance mainly in study 2, but only for students in higher grades.

40117193,Chase (2000),2000,"In 1995, the Hmong American Partnership, a community-based organization in St. Paul, Minnesota, began a 5-year program, Hmong Youth Pride (Hluas Hmoob Tsim Nuj - 2HTN) to increase academic achievement, school commitment, cultural pride, parental effectiveness and ATOD awareness, family relationships, future aspirations and disapproval of ATOD use among a group of 211 Hmong youth age 9-12 years attending three Minneapolis and St. Paul elementary schools. The intervention used to achieve these goals included (1) small-group tutoring sessions twice a week after school led by Hmong program managers, (2) bi-weekly after school structured group activities, including Hmong language and cultural lessons, ATOD education and recreational activities, (3) activities involving parents of participating youth such as home visits, cultural gatherings, and parent training workshops, and (4) cultural in-service training in Hmong culture for staff and administrators of participating schools. The evaluation of the 2HTN primary prevention program was a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures at baseline, post-program, and one-year follow-up comparing program participants with comparison group cohorts that did not receive the intervention. Comparison groups were recruited as convenience samples. For the comparison groups, baseline and post-test measures were administered at the same time periods as the intervention group. Measures included academic achievement, attitudes towards school, cultural pride, ATOD attitudes, parental involvement at school, parenting skills, parental awareness of ATOD risks, tangible support in schools for Hmong, and parents feelings of support in school for Hmong. Over the five years, 211 students enrolled in 2HTN at the three program sites included in this evaluation  52 of them (25%) stopped participating prior to completion. The program drop-outs were similar to participants on most demographic, academic and risk measures. Process research indicated that participants in the program had generally positive opinions about the content, implementation and impact of the program, though all groups had some criticisms and suggestions for change, including the need for better coordination and communication between program staff and teachers, more consistent discipline for students but a more flexible and evolving curriculum to encourage sustained interest, greater parent involvement in the program and better staff/parent communication. Outcomes analysis demonstrates that students participating in 2HTN often showed large improvements in age-adjusted academic performance and these improvements were significantly greater than those seen among comparison youth who do not receive treatment. The intervention also had a demonstrable impact on parental reports of involvement in school activities, and parental concern about how their children were treated as Hmong. Less clear-cut were results with regard to youth's school attitudes and cultural pride  some cohorts showed significant positive change relative to their comparison group, but not all. Results with regard to future and family risk, youth andparent ATOD attitudes, and effective parenting were weaker and inconsistent over time.",['Extending school time'],NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,Low ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10', '11', '12']",NA,NA,,3,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""These youth participants attend Mississippi and Frost Lake Elementary schools in St. Paul and Webster Elementary in Minneapolis,[¬e]""', 'Page 2:\n[¬s]""attending three Minneapolis and St. Paul elementary schools[¬e]""']",,,4,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""comparison group cohort of 30 Hmong youths was recruited from Jackson and Como Elementary Schools in St. Paul""\n""comparison group cohort of 30 Hmong youths was recruited also from Jackson and Como Elementary Schools[¬e]""']",,7,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""A second “uncontaminated” comparison group cohort of 30 Hmong youths was recruited from Jackson and Como Elementary Schools ""\n""A third “uncontaminated” comparison group cohort of 30 Hmong youths was recruited also from Jackson and Como Elementary Schools in St. Paul,[¬e]""', 'Page 2:\n[¬s]"" three Minneapolis and St. Paul elementary schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Retrospective Quasi Experimental Design (QED),NA,NA,,Not provided/ not available,NA,NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""a quasi-experimental design with repeated measures at baseline, post-program[¬e]""']",NA,,Not applicable,NA,NA,,['Yes'],NA,NA,,['Other types of student outcomes (Please specify)'],"['Page 15:\n[¬s]""What I Think Of School (Reid and Landesman, 1988)""\n"" Hmong Youth Survey, developed by WRC for the Hmong Youth Pride Evaluation.

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome of American year-round high school programs by comparing students' achievement in traditional and year-round high schools and by determining teachers' and administrators' opinions of the advantages and disadvantages of a year-round high school program. Method. The study compared students' achievement in a traditional high school (control group) and a single track year-round high school (experimental group), and surveyed the opinions of teachers and administrators at three multi-track year-round high schools regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the multi-track year-round high school program. Results. A comparison of students' achievement showed that on the CTBS mean scores, the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group (p $<$.05)  on the Scholastic Aptitude and the CAP tests mean scores, no statistically significant differences were found. In percentage of growth, the experimental group was higher than the control group  on the Stanford Achievement Test, the experimental group's mean score was significantly lower than the control group's at the first year  however, by the third year, its mean score was higher than the control group's in percentage increasing. Moreover, the experimental group mean scores and percentage of increase on CTBS and CAP were higher after the year-round program was introduced than before. A survey of teachers/administrators at three multi-track year-round high schools revealed that more than half of the respondents believed the advantages of year-round education outweighed the disadvantages. Advantages cited were  increases student enrollment  allows students to remediate immediately by repeating a class or switching to a more appropriate course during intersession  provides students with year-round opportunity for enrichment/remediation, athletic programs, and employment  allows families to take vacations at various times. Disadvantages cited were  disrupts family vacation plans, and causes difficulties when students transfer between year-round and traditional schools.

Unfortunately, print text provides very limited assistance to one's reading comprehension through its static knowledge representations such as symbols, charts, and graphs. Integrating digital materials and reading strategy into paper-based reading activities may bring opportunities for learners to make meaning of the print material. In this study, QR codes were adopted in association with mobile technology to deliver supplementary materials and questions to support students' reading. QR codes were printed on paper prints to provide direct access to digital materials and scaffolded questions. Smartphones were used to scan the printed QR codes to fetch pre-designed digital resources and scaffolded questions over the Internet. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of direct access to the digital materials prepared by the instructor using QR codes and that of scaffolded questioning in improving students' reading comprehension. The results suggested that direct access to digital resources using QR codes does not significantly influence students' reading comprehension  however, the reading strategy of scaffolded questioning significantly improves students' understanding about the text. The survey showed that most students agreed that the integrated print-and-digital-material- based learning system benefits English reading comprehension but may not be as efficient as expected. The implications of the findings shed light on future improvement of the system.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted to explore its effects on students' learning behaviors as well as their learning performance and perceptions of the mathematics course. The experimental results showed that both the formative and conventional peer-tutoring approaches significantly improved the students' learning achievement as well as reduced their cognitive load in comparison with conventional online collaborative learning approaches. In addition, the learning behavior analysis results showed that the students playing the role of tutor in the formative peer-tutoring group revealed more appropriate behaviors of assisting their tutees via discussing with them and providing hints to them as well as guiding them to solve the mathematics problems, while the tutees were more willing to ask questions than those learning with the conventional peer-tutoring approach.

Previous models of the effects of feedback account for lower-order learning outcomes but do not adequately describe experimental findings for higher order learning. Aims. Based on a connectionist model of feedback effects, this investigation aims to show that feedback that allows only one learner response facilitates proposition specific verbatim encoding, while feedback that requires the learner to try again on error facilitates relational fuzzy encoding. Sample and methods. Volunteer high school students were randomly assigned to one of 5 print-based lesson treatments that consisted of four science expository texts with adjunct inference-level questions covering science principles. The five treatments included delayed feedback, single-try immediate feedback, multiple-try immediate feedback, and two control treatments, questions without feedback, and text only. A post-test given 5 days after instruction was designed to measure both verbatim and fuzzy outcomes. Results. Multiple-try immediate feedback was best for paraphrased post-test questions (fuzzy) and worse for verbatim post-test questions. Conclusions.

Accordingly, burgeoning research is investigating if positive outcomes can be generated by intentionally placing a non-parental adult in a child's life through a mentoring program. One objective of these mentoring programs is maintaining students' engagement in school. This study was designed as a replication and extension of a one-year efficacy study by Holt et al. (2008), which evaluated a manualized, school-based, adult mentoring intervention for youths deemed at risk for school drop out. The current study lasted 18 months and included a new cohort of 38 similar low-income ninth graders from Holt et al.'s mid-Atlantic, urban high school. The students were randomly assigned to the mentoring group (n=19) or a control group (n=19). The mentors were trained, volunteer teachers, who received ongoing weekly consultation from the program developer. The students completed surveys at 3 different intervals, and 4 semesters of grades and discipline referrals were obtained from school records. As expected from Holt et al., in comparison to the control group, the youth who were assigned mentors reported significantly more positive perceptions of teacher support and received fewer discipline referrals. By the end of this study's extended follow-up period, mentored students also reported significantly greater sense of classmate acceptance and had higher grades in mathematics and language arts than the control group.

The study addressed the question  To what extent does an extended school year program for kindergartners, featuring phonemic awareness instruction, improve children's reading proficiency in the 1st and 2nd grade? Utilizing two district made surveys, the Phonemic Awareness Interview (PAI) and the Literacy Curriculum Scale (LCS) as pre-tests, 62 children from the 1997–1998 kindergarten cohort of 238 children were identified as exhibiting literacy and phonemic awareness deficits  they were invited to participate in the Kinder Camp Program. Of the 62 children invited 40 elected to participate and were identified as the Intervention group  22 children chose not to take part in the program and were identified as the Control group. Daily instruction in phonemic awareness as well as oral and written language activities were integral components of the five-week Kinder Camp Program. The program provided literacy enhancement through direct instruction and open-ended discovery “centers”. Children participated individually or in groups never exceeding 10. Teachers worked closely with parents at home and in the classroom. The Phonemic Awareness Interview post-test, five Marie Clay reading surveys and five Harcourt Brace Signatures© reading tests were administered at various times during the cohort's first and second grade school years as outcome assessments. A comparison was made of the Intervention and Control groups on those 11 outcome assessments. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used with the PAI pre-test and the LCS scores as covariates. The results indicate that the Intervention group scored significantly higher than the Control group on the Phonemic Awareness Interview post-test. The outcomes of the Marie Clay reading surveys and the Harcourt Brace Signatures© reading tests did not yield significant differences between the two groups.","['Summer schools', 'Phonics']",NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['5', '6']",NA,NA,,5,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]"" BRADFORDElEM.

37092576,Coe (2011),2011,"The 6+1 Trait Writing model (Culham 2003) emphasizes writing instruction in which teachers and students analyze writing using a set of characteristics, or ""traits,"" of written work  ideas, organization, voice, word choice, sentence fluency, conventions, and presentation. The Ideas trait includes the main content and message, including supporting details. The model has not been adequately studied using experimental methods. In order to provide evidence on the effectiveness of this approach, the study reported here was designed as a large-scale effectiveness trial (Flay 1986). The study addressed the following confirmatory research question  What is the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement in writing? It also investigated two exploratory research questions  (1) What is the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement in particular traits of writing?  and (2) Does the impact of 6+1 Trait Writing on grade 5 student achievement vary according to student gender or ethnicity? Data for the cluster-randomized experimental study were collected from participating grade 5 teachers and students in 74 Oregon schools. The benchmark estimates indicate that use of the 6+1 Trait Writing model significantly increased student writing scores during the year in which it was introduced to schools. After controlling for baseline writing scores, the estimated average score of students in the treatment group was 0.109 standard deviations higher (p = 0.023) than the estimated average score of students in the control group. An intervention with this effect size would be expected to increase the average level of achievement from the 50th to the 54th percentile. The findings remained stable when tested using alternative choices for the analytic sample and the model specification. In addition to the analysis of holistic writing scores, exploratory analyses found statistically significant differences between control and treatment group students on three of the six specific outcome measures of particular writing traits--organization, voice, and word choice-- with effect sizes ranging from 0.117 to 0.144 (p = 0.031 to 0.018). For the other three traits  ideas, sentence fluency, and conventions, the mean outcome score of students in the treatment condition was higher than that of students in the control condition, but these differences were too small to be considered statistically significant given the size and sensitivity of the experiment.

Social rejection was defined by low social preference scores on positive & negative sociometric items. Low achievement was defined by lower than 36th percentile standing on the Calif Achievement Tests in reading or mathematics. Achievement & sociometric scores were obtained at the end of third grade (preintervention), fourth grade (postintervention), & fifth grade (follow-up). Classroom observations were made before & after intervention. The 2 X 2 (AST X SST) analyses of covariance revealed that AST produced significant improvement in reading, math, & social preference scores. All but the math progress was sustained at the time of follow-up. SST only resulted in significant reading comprehension progress. The AST groups showed significantly reduced off-task behavior & more on-task behavior. The AST groups tended to become less disruptive. They also experienced increases in positive teacher attention. The advantages of focusing on academic competency for this subset of rejected children are discussed in terms of the behavior changes, the enduring quality of the change, & models of interaction between academic & social effectiveness. 3 Tables, 32 References.

37671598,Cole (2009),2009,"Billions of dollars are spent annually in response to widespread underachievement in areas of math and reading (National Assessment of Education Progress, 2003). Efficacy of these remedial academic programs is often poorly documented and few programs are designed to address individual needs (Kahne, Nagaoka, Brown, O'Brien, Quinn, & Thiede, 2001  Granger, Durlak, Yohalem, & Reisner, 2007). Furthermore, many students do not benefit from these programs due to behavior deficits that impact learning (Granger et al., 2007). The Challenging Horizons Program (CHP) is an evidence-based after-school program that provides an effective framework for engaging students with behavior deficits in learning activities (Langberg, Smith, Bogle, Schmidt, Cole, & Pender, 2006). At the start of this dissertation, the CHP did not have a curriculum targeting students' math performance. This dissertation describes the development of a remedial math intervention delivered within the Challenging Horizons Program designed to be delivered by paraprofessionals with limited training in teaching. To evaluate the curriculum, participants were randomly assigned to either receive the CHP as usual (N = 13) or the CHP plus math intervention 4 days a week (N=13). Outcomes were measured using brief timed assessments of basic math calculation and word problem solving, which showed generally positive effect sizes but low rates of reliable change on a case-by-case basis. No differences in skipping items between the control and treatment groups were observed on the basic calculation weekly assessment measure. Overall, this pilot study suggests that this math intervention can feasibly be delivered by paraprofessionals but some procedural and methodological limitations cloud the interpretation of the results with regard to the efficacy of the math intervention.

40134173,Coleman (2009),2009,"Introduction. Jefferson Middle School in Oceanside, California, offered an academic program called the Jefferson Academy for Student Success and Intervention (JASSI). The program focused on students who had shown an inability to function in a traditional classroom setting. The goal of JASSI was to keep at-risk students in school, on the regular campus, by supporting them through an alternative approach to the curriculum and giving them counseling support that focused on non-school and school-related issues. The problem. Although JASSI was available to students in grades 6 through 8, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in California Standards Test (CST) mathematics and reading/language arts scores of eighth-grade students enrolled in JASSI and eighth-grade students at other middle schools in the school district with similar academic and demographic backgrounds. Method. An independent samples t test was conducted to determine whether a significant difference existed in growth in mathematics and reading/language arts CST scores between the two groups of students. Results. The first hypothesis, which predicted a significant difference in the growth in mathematic scores on the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 CST, was not supported. The null hypothesis, which predicted no significant difference between the two groups, was supported. The second hypothesis, which predicted a significant difference in the growth in reading/language arts scores on the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 CST, was not supported. The null hypothesis, which predicted no significant difference between the two groups, was supported. Although there were no significant differences in the CST growth scores in mathematics between those enrolled in the JASSI program and those not enrolled in the program, the average mean growth scores between the two sets of students were numerically different, with a higher growth score among students enrolled in the JASSI program.

39717130,Compton (1992),1992,"For many young children, the process of learning to read in school is cumbersome and extremely difficult. As a result, remedial or compensatory services are provided to these students. Once these at-risk students are targeted for remedial services, generally through the Chapter 1 program (Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 1965), they receive small group reading instruction from a specifically trained professional teacher. A problem occurs when these children, generally the poorest readers in their class, do not make significant gains when compared to their age-appropriate peers. In the winter of 1988, a collaborative project between Western Michigan University and the Kalamazoo Public Schools, known as the Reading Connection, began linking university students with first grade students at risk of reading failure. Using very specific Reading Recovery (Clay, 1979) strategies, the university students tutored one-on-one with the very lowest functioning first grade students who were targeted to receive remedial services. Four hundred eighty-three first grade students participated in this study with 266 randomly selected to receive Reading Connection treatment, while the remaining 217 continued to receive small group service. The 266 students participating in the Reading Connection were randomly selected using a computerized random number generator that produced student numbers within a specified range. The results indicated that the Reading Connection students scored significantly higher than their Chapter 1 counterparts on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (Hieronymous & Hoover, 1985). In addition, when using student attendance as an indicator of success in school, the Reading Connection students had a significantly higher rate of average daily attendance than the students receiving the traditional Chapter 1 services. While positively supporting the hypothesis that there would be a difference between the two groups, this study also lent support to the importance of the predirected teaching professional experience, the Reading Recovery program in that, unlike Chapter 1 services, educational services can be delivered to young children at risk of reading failure that will cause them to break the pattern of the unsuccessful school experience.",['One to one tuition'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7']","['Page 63:\n[¬s]""The subjects ranged from age 6 years, 6 months to age 7 years, 7 months as of April 1, 1991.

Beginning in Grade 1, high-risk children and their parents were asked to participate in a combination of social skills and anger-control training, academic tutoring, parent training, and home visiting.

By the end of third grade, 37% of the intervention group was determined to be free of serious conduct-problem dysfunction, in contrast with 27% of the control group. Teacher ratings of conduct problems and official records of use of special education resources gave modest effect-size evidence that the intervention was preventing conduct problem behavior at school. Parent ratings provided additional support for prevention of conduct problems at home.

Schools using an alternative calendar format, as opposed to a traditional, nine month, September to June calendar have been used sporadically in this country for about 100 years. During this time, limited research has been conducted to quantify the effects of the approach on student achievement, attendance, and behavior. Fifth grade students from a school in Georgia using a year round school calendar were compared to fifth grade students from another elementary school, within the same district, using a traditional calendar approach. The schools were matched in terms of socio-economic status and minority rates. Data were gathered and compared for both groups regarding attendance, achievement in math and reading, and out of school suspensions. Further, a cohort comparison for those individuals attending school under the year round approach during both their third and fifth grade years was conducted to determine if improvements, in terms of achievement, were experienced. Correlations were conducted to determine if their was a significant relationship among attendance and achievement for students attending school under a year round approach. Statistical analysis determined that students attending school under a YRS calendar outperformed those students attending school under a traditional calendar in terms of achievement and attendance. However, students attending school under a traditional calendar were suspended from school less often than those on a year round calendar. A cohort comparison for individual students who attended school under the YRS approach in both third and fifth grades indicated statistically significant growth in reading, but not in math.

Students identified to receive Reading Recovery meet individually with a specially trained Reading Recovery (RR) teacher every school day for 30-minute lessons over a period of 12 to 20 weeks. The purpose of these lessons is to support rapid acceleration of each child’s literacy learning. In 2010, The Ohio State University received a Scaling Up What Works grant from the U.S. Department of Education’s Investing in Innovation (i3) Fund to expand the use of Reading Recovery across the country. The award was intended to fund the scale-up of Reading Recovery by training 3,675 new RR Teachers in U.S. schools, thereby expanding capacity to allow service to an additional 88,200 students. The Consortium for Policy Research in Education (CPRE) was contracted to conduct an independent evaluation of the i3 scale up of Reading Recovery over the course of five years. The evaluation includes parallel rigorous experimental and quasi-experimental designs for estimating program impacts, coupled with a large-scale mixed-methods study of program implementation under the i3 scale-up. This report presents findings through the second year of the evaluation. The primary goals of this evaluation were  a) to assess the success of the scale-up in meeting the i3 grant’s expansion goals  b) to document the implementation of scale-up and fidelity to program standards  and, c) to provide experimental evidence of the impacts of Reading Recovery on student learning under this scale-up effort.",['One to one tuition'],NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,628,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""Each of the 628 i3 schools contributed to three independent evaluation samples\nover the four-year evaluation period—the RCT, the RDD, and an internal-only evaluation.

This study involved repeated measurement with more than 12, 000 students and 2, 000 staff a survey of more than 1,000 parents, and extensive access to student records. It showed that Comer schools implemented some of the program's central elements better than control schools, but not all or even most of them. This shortfall in program implementation may have been responsible for students in the experimental schools not changing any more than controls. Quasi- experimental analyses showed that the program theory may be correct in many of its predictions about student changes in psychological and social outcomes, but not achievement. However, achievement gains were found in schools with a more explicit academic focus, suggesting that improving this focus should be as central to Comer's program theory as improving a school's social climate.

39717232,Cook (2001),2001,"The purpose of this study was to examine if minimally trained tutors could affect the reading achievement, attitudes toward reading, and the self-selected reading behaviors of at-risk first, second and third grade students compared to similar students who were not tutored. The study was conducted in one elementary school located in a neighborhood of considerable poverty in a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona. Quantitative results indicated that only at first grade did the tutored students outperform the untutored students on word identification. Further analysis revealed that the regularly tutored students at all grade levels had lower means than the irregularly tutored students on word identification and attitudes toward reading. These findings suggested that regular removal from the classroom for tutoring was harmful because an insufficient number of tutoring sessions resulted in a disruption to learning rather than an increased opportunity to learn. Tutored second grade students scored significantly higher than untutored students on attitude toward academic reading and both tutored second or third grade students scored higher than the untutored students did on attitudes toward academic and recreational reading. Second grade tutored students showed a trend toward more frequent engagement in self-selected reading behaviors than untutored second grade students did. Qualitative results indicated that tutor training was unfocused. Tutoring sessions revealed a lack of consistency in strategies, and both tutors and teachers reported that the tutors were unprepared to tutor. Tutor attrition and unreliability negatively impacted the quantitative results. Affirmative teacher comments indicated that tutoring positively affected student motivation to engage in reading. Parent and teacher surveys about student self-selected reading behaviors indicated that the tutored students tended to engage in more reading behaviors than the untutored students. It was recommended that a reading specialist design tutor training focused in four areas  rereading, writing, word analysis and reading new text. Student reading levels should be assessed so that tutoring materials are matched to student reading levels.

Also investigated were attendance and enrollment data for elementary students in both types of schools, and teacher evaluation of their respective schools for both types of schools. To investigate achievement effects, an ex post facto criterion-group design was used. The two criterion groups were the two school types--year-round and nine month  the dependent variables were mean school achievement test scores in reading and mathematics (on district-developed criterion-referenced tests at grades two through six and commercially produced norm-referenced tests at grades three and six), and language (on norm-referenced tests at grades three and six). For the analysis of attendance, the average annual percent attendance was calculated for both types of schools by dividing average daily attendance by average daily membership. Further analysis of year-round school attendance was conducted by adjusting this ratio to take into account reduced summer enrollment. Teacher attitudes about their school were compared via their respective mean rating of five Elements of Quality which described school environment or climate. The school sample consisted of seventy-five elementary schools, sixth-grade centers, and middle schools in the Clark County School District in Las Vegas, Nevada. An analysis of covariance using student socioeconomic status, percent minority students, and student ""school ability"" as the covariates, school structure as the independent variable, and mean school test scores in reading, mathematics, and language as the dependent variables was conducted. No consistent statistically significant differences were found in favor of either type of school, although a statistically significant difference in favor of the nine-month schools was found in six out of ten comparisons at grade three. Attendance at year-round schools was found to be only slightly lower than that at nine-month schools before adjustment was made for the effects of reduced summer enrollment. However, adjustment for this phenomenon showed substantially reduced summer attendance at year-round schools. Teacher opinionnaire data showed no difference in favor of either type of program.

38296678,Crawford (2014),2014,"The Literacy Intervention Toolkit (LIT) programme aims to improve the reading ability of children in Year 7 who scored below Level 4 at the end of primary school using a method known as reciprocal teaching. Reciprocal teaching methods encourage children to ‘become the teacher’. They are taught how to apply four comprehension strategies  summarising, clarifying, questioning, and predicting. These strategies enable children to check that they understand the content of the material they are reading and can make inferences based on what they have read. The LIT programme is tightly structured, providing training to staff as well as a set of detailed lesson plans on the use of reciprocal teaching to deliver basic instruction in literacy. However, the method of delivery is not particularly prescriptive. It can be used to teach whole classes or small groups, can be delivered by teachers or teaching assistants, and can be offered in addition to or instead of regular English classes. In this evaluation, children typically received 3–4 hours of LIT tuition per week for eight months, mostly delivered in small groups. The programme was devised by the Hackney Learning Trust, who delivered the training sessions for staff and developed a detailed set of lesson plans for them to follow. The primary outcome was reading ability as assessed by scores on the Access Reading Test (ART). The LIT programme was tested using a randomized control trial (RCT). 41 schools were recruited, with 22 schools randomly allocated to a treatment group and 19 schools to a control group.","['Reading comprehension strategies', 'Collaborative learning', 'Metacognition and self-regulation']",NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['12', '11']",NA,NA,,22,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""22 schools[¬e]""']",,,19,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""19 schools t[¬e]""']",,41,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" 41 schools were recruited[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],All Y7 classes in all 41 schools,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 11:\n[¬s]""randomized controlled trial""\n""There was a single treatment arm, with half of the 41 recruited schools randomly allocated to the treatment group and half to the control group.""\n"" In treatment schools, a subset of Year 7 pupils was selected to participate in the intervention.

The effectiveness of summer Chapter 1 programs was studied during Fall 1993 in 68 Chicago (Illinois) public schools. Students who had been in fourth grade in 1991-92 were divided into a group that had received Chapter 1 help during the school year and had attended 1992 summer school programs (n=1,006) and a group that had only school-year instruction (n=490). Reading comprehension and mathematics scores on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills were used as achievement pretest and posttests.

The evidence of this investigation suggests that streaming does not in fact have these effects—rather that the contrary is true.

Consequently, it is widely believed that both dull, average and bright pupils make maximum educational progress when streaming policies are operated. The evidence of this investigation suggests that streaming does not in fact have these effects—rather that the contrary is true. In view of the fact that streaming procedures at the junior stage of education do not find favour in most other advanced countries of the world whilst they are almost universally practised in English junior schools, it would seem that further research into the effects of streaming along the lines of the present investigation, are urgently needed.",['Setting or streaming'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['UK (Select all that apply)'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""Four three-class-entry junior schools,[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""It should be stressed that the \' non-streaming \' of School A was a consistently\nthought-out policy.""\n""School C was a school under the same local education authority, in the same\ntype of neighbourhood, but which streamed its children as they entered from the\ninfant school.""\n""Schools B and D are two three-class entry junior schools, B being un-\nstreamed for roughly the same reasons as School A, and D being streamed in the\nusual way.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['7', '8']",NA,NA,,1,NA,,,1,NA,,2,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""to compare test results derived from\nstreamed and unstreamed junior schools[¬e]""']",NA,,"Non-random, but matched",NA,NA,,School - cluster,"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""Four three-class-entry junior schools, A, B, C and D provided intelligence\nand attainment test data for this investigation.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Prospective QED'],NA,NA,,Not applicable,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,
40307281,Dao (1993),1993,"The emphasis of current research and educational programs within special education has mainly been on general language acquisition and acculturation issues pertaining to pupils of diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Despite educators' efforts to ""empower"" these students, there is a dearth of specific research-based intervention procedures. For the past one and half decade, American schools have been in desperate need for research-based instructional methods to address the needs of Southeast Asian-American students whose unique refugee background has resulted in various conditions of educational risk. This study investigates the effectiveness of the Reciprocal Teaching procedure among at-risk Vietnamese-American students. It is an experimental study of a method that promotes the development of reading comprehension and comprehension-monitoring strategies among this student population. Reading is addressed because it is the basis for language and literacy development and continued academic performance among immigrant and refugee populations. This study tests the assertion that a population of Vietnamese-American pupils, who receive reading instruction using the Reciprocal Teaching procedure, will have reading comprehension levels different from the Vietnamese-American pupils who receive the traditional reading instruction, as measured by the Nelson Reading Test. The sample consists of 50 (N = 50) fourth, fifth and sixth grade, fluent English proficient Vietnamese-American pupils whose scores are at or below the 50th percentile rank on the California Test of Basic Skills. All subjects are from families of low socioeconomic status. The experimental and control groups are equivalent, as determined by their random assignment and the comparable pretest scores.

40375719,Davis (1988),1988,"The problem was to determine the extent of influence that a mentor program had on increasing the academic achievement and attendance of ninth grade at-risk students in a selected urban secondary school. The research sample consisted of 40 at-risk students, half of which were randomly assigned to the experimental group and 20 randomly assigned to the control group. A chronicle account of each at-risk student is included in the data collected. A pre-test-post-test research design and t-test comparisons tested the statistical hypothesis of whether there was a difference in the gain in grade point average and attendance of those ninth grade at-risk students enrolled in the mentor program and those at-risk students who were not. There was no significant difference between the outcome data of the two groups. The at-risk students which showed gains in GPA and attendance had parents that gave support to the school and were involved in the educational process of these students. Conclusions drawn from this study include  (1) Direct principal involvement is necessary for a newly implemented mentoring program to be successful. (2) Parental involvement and support is paramount to the successful implementation of a mentoring program. (3) If parents are unable or unwilling to be involved, more emphasis must be placed on using school personnel as significant others. (4) The mentor program must be in place prior to the opening day of school. (5) An effective mentoring program requires that the mentor-mentee relationship be a compatible match.

Using a randomized design and pre-test/post-test comparisons gathered over the course of three school years (2003-2006) and controlling for the demographic risks of race, socioeconomic status, and family structure, the study examined mentoring's effect on participants'  (a) academic performance (grades), (b) school behavior (suspensions and attendance), (c) interpersonal interactions [comprised of aspects of bullying (bullying, being bullied, and interceding in bullying) and relational competence (asserting influence and conflict resolution)], and (d) health risks [comprised of depression and physical health risks (sexual activity and substance use)]. Although it was hypothesized that experimental group participants would demonstrate improvements in these outcome areas when compared to control participants, no significant differences were found when analyzing the entire group, only mentees who reported having high quality relationships with their mentors, or separately by program year. This study also used data from the 2005-2006 school year to examine the relation between quality of the mentoring relationship and quantity of time pairs spent together as well as the degree to which either contributed to youth outcomes. Results indicated that quality and quantity were indeed correlated, and that when considering both quality and quantity, quality predicted mentee physical health risks at post-test. Additionally, for girls who reported high quality relationships, quality predicted relational competence and depression. And when analyses on all mentees included only quality, results were significant for school behavior, bullying/being bullied, relational competence, and depression. Finally, analyses indicated that girls who entered the mentoring program with high attachments to their mothers or mother figures had significantly better outcomes in the areas of depression, bullying/being bullied, and relational competence than those with low attachments. Overall, results from the study indicate that, while aspects of the mentoring relationship may impact mentee's developmental outcomes, the effect of mentoring may not be enough to result in differences that vary significantly from a comparison group of girls not involved in mentoring. However, working to increase the quality of the mentoring relationship, the quantity of time pairs spend together, and a mentee's attachment to her mother or mother figure may impact mentoring's overall effectiveness and benefit early adolescent girls' development.",['Mentoring'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,Implemented in a school setting and using a program which has been introduced for many years.,,"['11', '12', '13']",NA,NA,,5,"['Page 42:\n[¬s]""School personnel at five middle schools\ncompleted a brief school concerns questionnaire to guide them in identifying girls who[¬e]""']",,,5,"['Page 42:\n[¬s]""School personnel at five middle schools\ncompleted a brief school concerns questionnaire to guide them in identifying girls who\nwere at risk for making poor academic, social, and/or emotional decisions, might benefit[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 42:\n[¬s]""School personnel at five middle schools\ncompleted a brief school concerns questionnaire to guide them in identifying girls who\nwere at risk for making poor academic, social, and/or emotional decisions, might benefit[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),NA,NA,,Individual,NA,NA,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 42:\n[¬s]""Participants were 168 early adolescent girls who were randomly assigned to be\neither mentored for a nine-month scholastic year or to serve as a comparison to the\nmentored group""\n""Of\nthose identified, half were randomly assigned to the mentoring program (referred to in\nthis study as the YWLP group) and half to the comparison group[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""Using a randomized design[¬e]""']",NA,,No/Unclear,"['Page 42:\n[¬s]""chool personnel at five middle schools\ncompleted a brief school concerns questionnaire to guide them in identifying girls who\nwere at risk for making poor academic, social, and/or emotional decisions, might benefit\nfrom a mentoring relationship, and were not already receiving other special services.

40307457,De Corte (2001),2001,"Background. With respect to the acquisition of competence in reading, new standards for primary education stress more than before the importance of learning and teaching cognitive and metacognitive strategies that facilitate text comprehension. Therefore, there is a need to design a research‐based instructional approach to strategic reading comprehension. Aims. The design experiment aimed at developing, implementing and evaluating a research‐based, but also practically applicable learning environment for enhancing skilled strategy use in upper primary school children when reading a text. Four text comprehension strategies (activating prior knowledge, clarifying difficult words, making a schematic representation of the text, and formulating the main idea) and a metacognitive strategy (regulating one's own reading process) were trained through a variety of highly interactive instructional techniques, namely modelling, whole class discussion, and small group work in the format of reciprocal teaching. Sample. Participants in the study were four experimental 5th grade classes (79 children) and eight comparable control classes (149 pupils). Method. The effects of the learning environment were measured using a pretest‐post‐test‐retention design. Multilevel hierarchical linear regression models were used to analyse the quantitative data of a Reading Strategy Test, a standardised Reading Comprehension Test, a Reading Attitude Scale, a Transfer Test and an interview about strategy use during reading. Results. The data of the Reading Strategy Test, the Transfer Test and the interviews about strategy use showed that the experimental group out‐performed the control group in terms of the strategy adoption and application during text reading. Whilst the experimental group also scored higher on the Reading Comprehension Test than the control group, the difference was not significant. Conclusions. This design experiment shows that it is possible to foster pupils’ use and transfer of strategic reading comprehension skills in regular classrooms by immersing them in a powerful learning environment.

Full-day kindergarten reappeared first in the 1960s as an intervention designed to help disadvantaged children ''catch up'' to their peers through additional schooling. More recently, it has gained popularity among non-poor parents and schools, so that children presently enrolled in full-day programs are, on average, very similar to their half-day counterparts in baseline test scores as well as other child, parent and school characteristics. Using longitudinal data, I estimate the impact of full-day kindergarten on standardized test scores in mathematics and reading, as children progress from kindergarten to first grade. I find that full-day kindergarten has sizeable impacts on academic achievement, but the estimated gains are short-lived, particularly for minority children.

In particular, the effects of a music program and a phonological skills program on phonological awareness were compared. If language and music share basic processing mechanisms, the effect of both programs on enhancing phonological awareness should be similar. Forty-one preschoolers (22 boys) were randomly assigned to a phonological skills program, a music program, and a control group that received sports training (from which no effect was expected). Preschoolers were trained for 10 min on a daily basis over a period of 20 weeks. In a pretest, no differences were found between the three groups in regard to age, gender, intelligence, socioeconomic status, and phonological awareness. Children in the phonological skills group and the music group showed significant increases in phonological awareness from pre- to post-test. The children in the sports group did not show a significant increase from pre- to post-test. The enhancement of phonological awareness was basically driven by positive effects of the music program and the phonological skills program on phonological awareness for large phonological units. The data suggests that phonological awareness can be trained with a phonological skills program as well as a music program.

Comparisons were made between ethnic groups and economically disadvantaged students attending schools that operate on traditional and year-round calendars. Comparisons of third grade student performance on all tests taken were conducted to determine if differences in achievement were statistically significant. The number of districts submitting year-round calendars to the Texas Education Agency has grown steadily since 1991. The concept is rapidly gaining acceptance in Texas, generally for fiscal reasons. Fifty-eight school districts submitted year round calendars in the fall of 1993. Today, minimal Texas data exist regarding the impact on student achievement when implementing year-round schools. Decisions by boards of trustees and administrators to implement new programs, such as year-round schools, should not be based solely on fiscal issues. There is a moral and ethical obligation to determine that new programs do not have a negative impact on student achievement. A best case scenario provides school districts the opportunity to positively impact student achievement while maintaining sound fiscal practices and solvency. Year-round schooling is apparently here to stay in Texas. Should that be the case, it is important that educators and parents have sufficient data for decision making.

ThinkForward is targeted at pupils who have been identified as being at high risk of not being in education, employment or training (NEET) following the completion of compulsory education. Coaches are assigned to schools and work with selected pupils as they progress through Key Stage 4 (GCSEs), with the aim of supporting them to make a successful transition into adulthood. The programme provides targeted support tailored to pupils’ needs through one-to-one and group work. The programme usually works with young people aged 14 - 19, though this pilot focused only on the intervention up to age 16, prior to pupils leaving school. The pilot involved Year 10 and 11 pupils in four London secondary schools, beginning in January 2014. The Y11 pupils received up to six months of ThinkForward until their GCSEs in summer 2014. The Y10 pupils received up to 18 months of ThinkForward up until their GCSEs in summer 2015. The pilot was evaluated using a range of qualitative methods and a small Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). The aims of the evaluation were to determine whether a future large-scale evaluation was possible, and to gain an initial estimate of the programme’s impact on GCSE scores, the likelihood of continuing into post-compulsory education, and decreasing pupil absences. Randomisation took place at both school and pupil level. Within the two randomly assigned intervention schools, eligible pupils were randomly allocated either to an intervention group or a within-school control group.

Results from studies with K-12 participants have been inconclusive regarding the potency of the graphic organizer (GO) as a comprehension tool.

37671548,Dockrell (2015),2015,"""Talk for Writing"" is an approach to teaching writing that emphasizes three teaching methods  (1) 'imitation' (where pupils learn texts by heart, so they can discuss and dissect them)  (2) 'innovation' (where pupils adapt stories to create their own versions)  and (3) 'invention' (where teachers help pupils to create original stories). These tasks aim to improve writing ability by giving pupils an understanding of the structure and elements of written language. This project sought to develop ""Talk for Writing"" into a whole-school programme. The pilot programme ran for 18 months, from January 2013 to July 2014, and involved ten schools in Portsmouth. It included a series of 6 full days for school leadership teams (project teams) plus three whole school conferences (""Big Days"") to train teachers and teaching assistants. It covered all primary age groups from nursery to year 6. In addition to the training and support for schools, the programme provided materials, resources, and guidance for staff development, planning and progression. Each school appointed a ""literacy lead"", who was responsible for implementing the programme. This developmental pilot was subject to an evaluation, which had three aims  (1) to appraise the research literature underpinning key dimensions of the ""Talk for Writing"" pedagogy  (2) to evaluate the promise and feasibility of the programme, and provide formative recommendations to inform future evaluation and development  and (3) to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the potential impact of the programme on writing skills that could be used to inform any future trial. The evaluation took place over twelve months and involved six of the 10 intervention schools, one of which withdrew halfway through the programme following the appointment of a new headteacher, and three comparison schools. There were two comparison schools in Portsmouth and one in London. Key conclusions of the project were  (1) most of the teachers were enthusiastic about implementing Talk for Writing within a whole school approach and felt that it provided a consistent approach to teaching writing. However, one school was withdrawn from the project by a new headteacher  (2) features of the programme were embedded in the classrooms, and teachers generally found the programme straightforward to implement  (3) the project displayed mixed evidence of promise. Teachers reported that it had an impact on pupils' writing skills. However, the literature review found mixed support from the current research base for the principles underlying the programme  (4) further research is required to securely estimate the impact of the approach on academic attainment. It would be valuable to undertake some additional development work to refine the approach before it undergoes a full trial  and (5) other research suggests that oral language may play a stronger role in supporting writing in the early years than in Key Stage 2. The programme might benefit from targeted support of key oral language competencies to support the production of early written text in struggling writers and those with weaker oral language skills.

Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior.

40307284,Dole (1996),1996,"This instructional study examined group and individual differences arising from strategy instruction. In the first phase of the study, 67 fifth and sixth graders from a designated at‐risk school were randomly assigned to one of the three treatments—strategy instruction, story content instruction, and basal control instruction. For 5 weeks, all students received one of the three treatments embedded within a narrative selection they read each day. Baseline, immediate posttest, and 7‐week delayed posttest data were analyzed using ANCOVA. Results indicated that the strategy group performed as well as the story content and basal control groups when students read texts after receiving instruction. However, the strategy group outperformed the story content and basal control groups when students were asked to read selections on their own. In the second phase of the study, two students from the strategy group were selected to examine individual students' responses to strategy instruction. Written assessments, classroom observations, and oral interviews were used to identify possible reasons why a lower achieving student used the strategy she learned successfully, and a higher achieving student did not. It appeared that the lower achieving strategy user was motivated to use the strategy which she perceived as helpful to her. Further, as her ability to use the strategy increased, so did her daily comprehension of the stories she read. On the other hand, the higher achieving student was not motivated to use the strategy. She perceived the strategy as unhelpful and preferred her own strategies instead. This student's daily comprehension actually declined as she used the strategy. Taken together, both phases of the study shed light on the benefits of strategy instruction for at‐risk students. But findings from this study also show how students' motivation can influence their use of the instruction they receive.

The first involved training teachers in how to embed metacognitive approaches in their work, and how to continue to effectively and strategically involve parents. This training took place over a day and was provided by a consultant. The second component focused on parental engagement and offered families the opportunity to participate in a series of facilitated workshops where children and parents work together to create an animated film. Sessions were coordinated by a practitioner who helped participants to think about how they are learning, create learning goals and reflect on their progress  to be metacognitive about the learning process they were engaged in together. The families were offered 2 hours of workshops per week for 5 weeks (10 hours in total). The project targeted schools in four areas of England  Birmingham, Devon, London and Manchester. It was delivered by the Campaign for Learning, with assessments carried out by Durham University. Delivery started in September 2012 and finished in October 2013. The project was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial, which compared the interventions to a ‘business-as-usual’ control group.

Finally, the effects of precision teaching were studied on the self-concept and anxiety levels of both the regular and special education populations. The study was significant because the special education population had not been studied in connection with precision teaching precedures and if found successful could be a viable program for this group. This study was conducted in 1978 on a group of 120 subjects who were identified as special education students and on another group of 180 subjects who were identified as regular education students. In the special education population 60 subjects were treated using precision teaching procedures. An additional 90 subjects in the regular education group received the treatement. These students were compared to control groups of 60 and 90 students for the special and regular education populations respectively. Procedures included  (1) screening and identification using standardized tests and one-minute probes, (2) remediation utilizing the building of basic tool skills with one-minute practice sheets and, (3) the employment of direct and daily measurement as a technique for monitoring student performance.

Methods This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a reading and language intervention for 6‐year‐old children identified by research criteria as being at risk of dyslexia (n = 56), and their school‐identified peers (n = 89). An Experimental group received two 9‐week blocks of daily intervention delivered by trained teaching assistants  the Control group received 9 weeks of typical classroom instruction, followed by 9 weeks of intervention. Results Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses, small‐to‐moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. However, these were fragile and short lived, and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word‐level reading. Conclusions This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions, yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation. We suggest that the intervention may have been too short to yield improvements in oral language  and that literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened training effects.

However, it is not known whether teachers can, as a part of the regular instructional program for students in low reading groups, develop awareness of how to be strategic and, as a result, improve learning outcomes. The experimental intervention study reported here trained classroom teachers to be explicit when teaching low reading groups to use reading skills strategically. Twenty-two teachers participated in the study. It was hypothesized that explicit teacher explanation of how reading skills can be used as strategies would result in increased student awareness of what was taught, which in turn would lead to increased reading achievement on standardized measures. Results suggested that the treatment teachers learned to be more explicit in teaching reading skills, and that this explicitness resulted in significantly greater student awareness of what was taught. However, no significant achievement gains were found.

The participants in this study were students matched from Traditional calendar and Year-Round (YRE) calendar programs. The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) examination was used to measure student achievement in math and reading because it is the legislatively mandated standardized assessment for public school students in Texas. To accomplish this purpose, a total of 199 Year-Round calendar students from three public school districts in Texas were matched to Traditional calendar students within their respective district. Students were matched according to gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and ability level. They were matched on scaled scores of the reading and math portions of TAAS for the baseline year of 1992-93. Three consecutive years' data were analyzed to measure the degree of gain demonstrated in math and reading. This three-year quasi-experimental study utilized a Randomized Block Design in a 2 (calendar configuration) x 3 (year) repeated measure format. The repeated measure was the year the TAAS subtests of math and reading were taken  Fall 1992, Spring 1994, and Spring 1995. Findings in this study were mixed. Traditional calendar students demonstrated greater achievement gains than their Year-Round calendar counterparts in TAAS math. YRE calendar students demonstrated greater achievement gains in TAAS reading than their Traditional calendar counterparts. Hispanic YRE students realized two consecutive years of gain in reading. Calendar configuration appeared to have no effect upon male students. Female students in YRE programs demonstrated greater gains in TAAS reading for Years Two and Three of the study. Future research concerning the effect of calendar configuration on student achievement gain is recommended which utilizes a research design similar to this study. This should include (1) cohort analysis, (2) longitudinal data, (3) control for variables of interest (race, gender, socioeconomic status, intersession, and calendar type), and (4) the use of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills examination as the measurement tool.",['Extending school time'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 61:\n[¬s]"" elem entary students[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['8', '9', '10']","['Page 65:\n[¬s]""Data for participants came from TAAS exams\ntaken during their third, fourth, and fifth grade school years[¬e]""']",NA,,3,NA,,,3,NA,,6,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 27:\n[¬s]""The three Year-Round groups w ere selected from: four YRE campuses of diverse student populations in a[¬e]""', 'Page 28:\n[¬s]""suburban setting, a YRE cam pus with a 97% Hispanic student population w ith a predom inantly low socioeconomic status in an urban s e ttin g , and an ethnically mixed YRE campus in rural setting with approximately 50% Caucasian, 38% Black, an d 12% Hispanic.[¬e]""', 'Page 61:\n[¬s]""The A ustin YRE group in d u d e d 26 YRE students who were matched w ith students from a pool of 324 traditional calendar students in Austin ISD.

39253282,Durand (2002),2002,"In 1998, the Texas Reading Initiative stated that all students should be able to read on grade level or higher by the end of the third grade and continue to read on grade level or higher throughout their schooling. Yet, many students are still struggling at the end of the third grade year. These students are identified as “struggling readers” by the scores they receive on the statewide administered achievement test. A summer school program entitled the Summer Reading Academy was put into place to assist these “struggling readers” in their reading achievement. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of the Summer Reading Academy on the reading achievement of the third grade students who qualified and attended the Summer Reading Academy and the third grade students who qualified and did not attend the Summer Reading Academy. The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills was used as the measure of reading achievement. The participants for the study were 232 third grade students who scored below 70% on the 2000 TAAS and attended school in a large suburban Texas school district. These students were all identified as “struggling readers” and were invited to attend the 2000 Summer Reading Academy. One hundred sixteen of the students completed the Summer Reading Academy, which make up the Academy Group. One hundred sixteen of the students did not attend the Summer Reading Academy, which make up the Comparison Group. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group research design was used to compare the progress made by Academy Group and progress made by the Comparison Group using the April 2000 and April 2001 Texas Assessment of Academic Skills reading subtests scores. The results reported indicated that there were no statistically significant differences (p > .05) between the Academy Group and the Comparison Group with regard to the six objectives measures by the reading section of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. Thus, the gains made by the Academy Group should not be attributed to their participation in the Summer Reading Academy. There is a need for more research, as high-stakes testing and reading education are on the rise nationwide. Teachers need more training in what to teach students who have been identified as “struggling readers” and how to maintain increased reading levels when they are accomplished.

40294902,Ehlinger (1988) FB,1988,"Research in reading comprehension and reading strategies suggests that cognitive modeling by teachers is an effective instructional tool to teach reading comprehension processes. However, despite evidence suggesting the effectiveness of such an approach, little is known about how teachers most effectively model these processes and how students are influenced by modeled strategies. A Social Cognitive Theory of Learning was used as a theoretical basis for this investigation which was designed to address two major questions  (1) What are the relative merits of characteristics of general modeling when applied to cognitive modeling of reading comprehension processes? (2) How do the characteristics of modeling, when applied to cognitive modeling of reading processes, influence the comprehension and comprehension monitoring of eighth grade readers? One hundred average eighth grade readers were randomly assigned to one of four modeling conditions  (1) Passive Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling only. (2) Active Cognitive Modeling. Cognitive modeling with statements to explain the functional value of the modeled strategy and to foster self-efficacy in the students. (3) Full range Cognitive Modeling. Modeling same as ""active"" group with feedback, (4) Control. No modeling. Students met with the researcher in small groups for three sessions. Each session consisted of the researcher's verbal cognitive modeling of a passage being read, followed by the students individually applying the modeled strategy to another passage, followed by an oral retelling of the passage and comprehension questions. Data were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance for oral retelling scores and for comprehension question scores, and with a chi-square for strategy use. Strategies were predetermined or emerged from qualitative analysis of the think-aloud protocols. Results revealed  (1) There were significant differences among groups for use of reading comprehension monitoring strategies (p $<$.05). The modeling conditions did significantly more monitoring of their comprehension by applying the modeled strategies and by using their own un-modeled strategies. (2) There were significant differences among groups for reading comprehension based on oral retellings (p $<$.05).

Most educators resonate with classroom practices proposed by whole language advocates. Some, however, believe that the position taken against the direct teaching of phonics skills by whole language enthusiasts is ill‐advised, especially for first‐grade children. A recent review of studies comparing whole language approaches with basal approaches suggests that whole language approaches may not be as effective as basals in helping students master the word recognition skills prerequisite to effective comprehension. A modified whole language approach, focusing more directly on word recognition skills, was developed, implemented, and tested in three first‐grade classrooms in Provo, Utah. Nine of ten characteristics generally associated with whole language approaches were kept intact in the modified program. However, a daily 15‐minute period of total class phonics instruction was added to the program, which is not characteristic of whole language approaches. The year‐long study compared the reading achievement effects of the “modified whole language” approach implemented in three classrooms in one school with those obtained from a popular basal approach implemented in three classrooms in a second school in the same school district. Both schools were matched according to student achievement, socio‐economic background, and student turnover. A posttest‐only control group with a pretest covariate research design was used. Vocabulary and comprehension were measured using the Gates‐MacGinitie Reading Test, Level A, Form 1. Phonics and reading attitudes were measured using author‐developed instruments. All tests were administered to all students in September and in May. Students involved in the modified whole language program made greater achievement gains in phonics, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and total reading achievement than students in the basal program.

Summer school has been a means to help struggling students throughout the history of American education. Programs differ in their design, curriculum, target populations, and purpose. Limited research was found that identifies positive elements of successful summer programs. Program assessments tend to be limited to beginning scores compared to ending scores of the summer school participants. Few studies were found comparing summer school participants with a control group consisting of non-summer-school participants. This study investigated a middle school summer program designed as an intervention strategy for struggling students. An experimental group, those attending a 6-week summer school, and a control group, similar students not attending summer school, were compared using a standards-based assessment at the end of 1 year and again at the end of 2 years. The results of the study indicated that when controlling for demographic factors such as grade level, gender, and income status, no significant increases in test scores were found in language arts or mathematics performance. Data analysis supported failure to reject either of the null hypotheses. The results did indicate much variation from year to year and group to group. The length of time between the summer school intervention and the testing window may have been impacted by other school interventions for both groups. A recommendation for a future study was presented to repeat a similar quasi-experiment using a summer school group and control group.

37061114,Elliot (1986),1986,"The purpose of this study was to investigate use of the microcomputer to enhance poor readers' comprehension of text. The study focused on two text-centered comprehension strategies, questions interspersed in text and immediate feedback, which were used in conjunction with computer-presented passages. The feedback capability of the computer was of primary interest, and was demonstrated by providing feedback regarding students' answers to interspersed questions. Poor readers were used as subjects because of indications from prior research that they are less able to organize text and to monitor their performance during reading than are good readers, suggesting that poor readers may benefit from externally-provided comprehension aids. There were three experimental groups  (a) a text-only group which read computerized text without interspersed questions or feedback, (b) a group reading the text with interspersed questions, but without feedback, (c) a group receiving feedback in addition to interspersed questions. Subjects were 66 sixth and seventh graders reading one to two years below grade level, who were randomly assigned to treatments. All subjects read 250-word expository passages, one science-related and one social studies-related. Re-reading of relevant portions of passages after answering interspersed questions was permitted. A cloze test and multiple-choice test consisting of factual and inferential questions were administered after each passage. The following relationship among groups was predicted for each of the four dependent variables (cloze, multiple-choice test, factual questions, inferential questions)  Group 1 < Group 2 < Group 3. A series of four 3 (type of presentation) x 2 (type of passage) ANOVAS with repeated measures on passages was performed. Study results failed to confirm the predicted relationships, as no significant differences were found among treatment groups for any of the dependent variables. Additional results showed that subjects did little re-reading of text and spent about half the time reading feedback as was expected. The latter finding may have contributed to the lack of significant results. It was concluded that poor readers will not necessarily be motivated to read all material presented to them on a microcomputer.

Significant increases in student achievement were found for year-round students in the areas of third-grade writing and fifth-grade writing, reading, and mathematics. Year-round students had significantly better attendance patterns than did traditional calendar students. Parents of year-round students perceived the quality of instruction to be better than did parents of traditional calendar children.

40117129,Espinosa (2000),2000,"Since the establishment of a uniform school calendar of approximately 180 days in the early 20th century, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of the three-month summer break on the retention of learning by school children. Most studies indicate that long summer vacation results in students forgetting much that was learned during the regular school year. There is an existing controversy about the effectiveness of year-round school calendars. Most of this controversy is generated by studies which do not seem to evidence that this type of calendar results in academic gains. Other studies have shown that students in year-round schools achieve as much or more than students in traditional schools. Some traditional school research studies have investigated the problem of learning loss over long summer breaks, with particular regard to the effect such breaks have on disadvantaged and minority students. The problem of learning loss is well documented. The purpose of this study was to establish a comparison between the traditional, September through June calendar and the year-round calendar with regard to increased student achievement. Given the increasing popularity of the year-round calendar in Chicago, this study was conducted to investigate whether or not increased continuity fostered by the year-round calendar had any kind of impact on the increased academic performance of students. The students in the sample population were continuously exposed to this modality of instruction for a period of three years.

40307289,Esser (2001),2001,"This study examined the relative effects of three intervention methods on the reading comprehension of students with learning disabilities. Participants were 110 African-American sixth and seventh grade students who attended an urban middle school in the Midwest. Eighty of the participants had been identified as learning disabled, and 30 participants were enrolled in a regular education program for the academically talented at the school. The three intervention methods employed in the study were Metacognitive Strategy Training, Attribution Retraining, and Combined Metacognitive Strategy Training and Attribution Retraining. In addition to the treatment groups, a control group of students with learning disabilities and an average reader control group were included. The intervention program took place over a three-week period, with two, 50-minute sessions per week. Learning disabled students in the Metacognitive Strategy Training group received instruction in five metacognitive reading strategies  purpose setting and previewing, using background knowledge and developing text-related questions, and summarization. Participants in the Attribution Retraining group were provided with instruction designed to help them adopt self-promoting beliefs regarding academic achievement. Students in the Combined group were exposed to a combination of the strategy training and attribution retraining used with the other treatment groups. Participants in the LD control group and the non-LD control group were given no training. Rather, they were asked to read one or two passages per session and respond to multiple-choice questions related to the passages. Participants' performance on a metacomprehension reading strategy inventory, an attribution rating scale, a reading comprehension quiz and a strategy use inventory was measured prior to the intervention (pretest), immediately following the intervention (posttest 1) and six weeks following the intervention (posttest 2). Data was analyzed using a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with IQ as a covariate. The results yielded significant time x group interaction effects on all variables, indicating that the method of intervention differentially effected subject response. While no significant time effects were found, profile plot analysis suggested that a combination of metacognitive strategy training and attribution retraining appeared to be the most promising of the three intervention methods.",['Reading comprehension strategies'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12', '13']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 70:\n[¬s]""an u rb a n m id d le s c h o o l in th e m id w e s t[¬e]""']",,,1,"['Page 70:\n[¬s]"" an u rb a n m id d le s c h o o l in th e m id w e s t[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 70:\n[¬s]""an u rb a n m id d le s c h o o l in th e m id w e s t[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],NA,"This study has five arms, but for the purposes of this coding exercise we will focus on  1.

Students' activities in 20 classrooms were observed, confirming that half of the classrooms followed an individualized language-experience approach and half a decoding-oriented basal reader approach. Year-end testing of the students revealed basic level reading skill to be less universally acquired in the language-experience group, but no difference in information processing and linguistic abilities between the two groups. In addition, while the various cognitive measures generally correlated positively with reading in the decoding-oriented group, significant negative correlations between linguistic ability and reading skill were observed in the language-experience group. It is argued that linguistic ability facilitates beginning reading only after a threshold of print-specific skills is acquired, and that the observed difference between the two groups stemmed primarily from their varying emphasis on systematic instruction, with corrective feedback, of these print-specific skills.",['Phonics'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['UK (Select all that apply)'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 6:\n[¬s]""le.

The present research examines the impact of one such approach, Direct Phonics (Wilson and Reason, 2003). Direct Phonics was introduced in 6 schools during 2002-2003 involving 15 teachers and 11 teaching assistants working with 16 groups of children in total. Quantitative data was obtained for a total of 40 children aged between 72 - 89 months, on the following pre and post intervention measures  receptive language as measured by the BPVS, phonological skills as measured by the PhAB, basic word recognition as measured by the WORD, various curriculum-based measures relating to letter and word knowledge. Qualitative data was obtained through discussions with the teaching staff, their observations and records and examples of the pupils' work. Curriculum-based measures drawing on the content of Direct Phonics demonstrated most convincing progress. There were also significant gains in scores on the WORD test but a calculation of effect size did not indicate that the children were 'catching up' with their age peers. It was argued that, in comparison with curriculum-based assessments, standardised tests were 'blunt' measures of progress for children in the beginning stages of literacy learning. Before the intervention, many of the children demonstrated phonological weaknesses on the PhAB test. The children's scores improved significantly on the sample of subtests administered post-intervention. Correlational analysis showed that PhAB scores were not related to children's curriculum-based measures of progress or their progress on the WORD test. BPVS as a baseline measure of receptive vocabulary was significantly related to the curriculum-based outcome measures. Case examples of two children making slow progress illustrated how their learning was a function of various factors including the pupils' motivation, language skills, their phonological profiles and their school attendance.",['Phonics'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 20:\n[¬s]""small group of 6 primary schools[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '8']","['Page 108:\n[¬s]""All the pupils were from the key stage 1 department of the primary schools.\nWhen the intervention began, the mean age was 79 months; the youngest pupil\nwas 72 months and the oldest was 89 months.[¬e]""']",NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,6,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Regression discontinuity,"['Page 97:\n[¬s]""Four of the subtests were followed up; alliteration, rhyme,\nnaming speed pictures and nonword reading.

40117274,Finch (1997),1997,"This quasi-experimental study was designed to explore the effects of short-term, supplementary, computer-assisted instruction (CAI) on improving the math scores of rural, economically-disadvantaged seventh grade students as measured by standardized tests. The study examined the significance of gender, age, time the use of an integrated learning system (ILS), before- and after-school CAI sessions, and the correlation between the math portions of the California Achievement Test (Spring, CAT 16E) and the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (Fall, MEAP) test. All Michigan schools participate in MEAP math testing every school year, five weeks into the school year. Many studies have investigated the effectiveness of CAI upon academic performance for elementary, high school, and university students in urban settings, Past research studies have shown the usefulness of CAI with economically and educationally challenged pupils, as well as low-achieving students, but a limited amount of research has focused upon the math performance of middle level, economically-disadvantaged, rural students. The population of this study consisted of the entire 1996-1997 seventh grade population of 180 students at a northern Michigan middle school. Thirty-five students were randomly chosen for the CAI experimental group from a group of 60 volunteers. The five week, daily, CAI sessions occurred in a before- and after-school format. The control group consisted of 35 students randomly chosen from the remaining students. The spring math CAT 16E (pretest) was used to verify there existed no significant difference in the groups. The impact of CAI upon the MEAP math test (posttest) was examined by 12 hypotheses.

The population of the study consisted of third, fourth, and fifth grade students enrolled in regular classrooms and in Chapter 1 Reading in two Midwestern school corporations. There were 266 students in the study. The experimental group received instruction and modeling in reciprocal teaching comprehension monitoring strategy by the Chapter 1 teachers. The control group did not receive instruction and modeling of the strategy. The Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Form G (Levels 9, 10, 11), was administered as the pretest and posttest. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate differences between the experimental group and the control group which may have resulted from the treatment effect. The hypotheses tested the reading comprehension achievement gain, science achievement gain, and social science achievement gain. Findings. (1) It was found that there were significant differences in third, fourth, and fifth grade students in science achievement gain when they had instruction and modeling of reciprocal teaching. (2) It was found that there were significant differences in third grade students in reading comprehension achievement and social science achievement when they had instruction and modeling of reciprocal teaching.

The data were analyzed through four identical ANOVA's for each of grades three and five, two each dealing with the number of objectives mastered and number of items correct in communications, the other two each with the number of objectives mastered and number of items correct in mathematics. A 6 x 2 ANOVA comprising two levels of treatment and six levels of Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) status was used. The dependent variables were the number of objectives mastered or number of items correct for each of the eight analyses. The independent variable, attendance at the summer session, was divided into two levels of treatment  no attendance and 15-30 days attendance. Third grade students who attended summer school scored significantly higher (p < .05) than students who did not attend on three measures of the SSAT. At the fifth grade level, analyses showed no significant difference between attendance groups on any of the four measures. The interaction between attendance and SAT stanine levels was not significant in any of the analyses. The main effect of stanine level measures on SSAT achievement was significant in all eight analyses indicating the usefulness of the SAT as a blocking variable. Differences in results at the two grade levels may be attributed to the possible invalidity of SSAT test results at fifth grade level with this learning disabled population due to test format and administration procedures. Major recommendations include further research into test modifications for LD students to insure SSAT test validity.

The results of these studies suggested that phonological awareness training which incorporates reading, spelling, and writing can form a useful part of a literacy programme for children with reading difficulties. Significant improvements in reading and spelling were found in the children who had followed the PAT programme. In addition to this, phonological skills such as rhyme fluency and spoonerisms, as measured by the Phonological Assessment Battery (PhAB), also showed significant improvement.

Methods  In a randomized controlled trial, 180 children from 15 UK nursery schools (""n"" = 12 from each setting  M[subscript age] = 4 0) were randomly allocated to receive a 30-week oral language intervention or to a waiting control group. Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by nursery staff and teaching assistants trained and supported by the research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6-month delay. Results  Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness. Importantly, improvements in oral language skills generalized to a standardized measure of reading comprehension at maintenance test.

47269801,Friedman (1990) PT,1990,"The present study compared the sensitivity to growth of curriculum-based (CBA) and traditional measures for 41 mildly handicapped and non-handicapped second through sixth graders, over a 12-week period. All students received the CBA reading and spelling measures as well as a traditional, group achievement test in reading and spelling at the beginning, middle, and end of the 12-week period. In addition, students in the intervention group received a traditional, individualized achievement test at each of the three occasions. During the 12-week span of the study, one group of handicapped students received peer-tutoring in reading. The other two groups of students continued to receive regular, daily reading instruction, without peer-tutoring. Results showed that CBA measures of reading were more sensitive to short-term student progress than were traditional measures of reading, across time. Both absolute (within-measure) and relative (comparison of two measures) changes in student performance over the 12-week period favored the CBA measures. The non-classified, non-peer-tutored group (regular-education students) consistently outperformed the special-education students. Amounts of change during each of the three test intervals were more equivocal  only one measure, a CBA reading measure, showed more change from one time period to another, and none of the groups differed in their amount of change. In addition, the sensitivity of the curriculum-based measures appeared to be directly related to the curricular materials from which they were formulated. All three CBA measures based on a second basal reader showed significant differences in amounts of change, for peer-tutored students. These findings suggest that students' short-term reading progress is most accurately assessed with curriculum-based measures taken directly from their curricula, with increased sensitivity of CBA's to some materials over others.

This model was designed to help students change hyperactive and attentional behavior in the service of improving academic achievement and classroom performance. The dependent variables were mathematics report card grades, the arithmetic subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), conduct behavior, hyperactive behavior, inattentive/passive behavior, and a hyperactivity index. The effects of training on achievement and behavior were observed in the special education resource room setting and in the mainstreamed mathematics classes. Results of the Connors Teachers Rating Scale-Short Form were used to determine the presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders among the special education learning disabled students in grades seven through eleven in a suburban public school district on Long Island. The raters were the special education teachers and the regular education mathematics teachers. All students were mainstreamed in regular education mathematics. Twenty-eight seventh through eleventh grade students participated in the study. Fourteen students were assigned to a treatment group and fourteen to a control group. The study was conducted in the natural school setting, during the regular hours of the school day. Cognitive training took place in the special education resource room. Training included self-recording, self-verbalization and attribution training. Self-recording involved the students in recording their hyperactive and attentional behavior during training sessions in the resource room and then in the mainstream mathematics classes. Training in self-verbalization led to internalizing self-directed statements during problem solving situations. Attribution training was designed to help the student understand the reasons for success and failure on mathematics assignments and tests. An Analysis of Covariance was calculated on each of the past-treatment variables. Results showed better treatment than control group scores in hyperactive and attentional behavior in the special education resource room setting and higher treatment than control group mathematics report card grades. No significant posttreatment difference was found between treatment and control groups in the behavior in mainstream mathematics classes or on the WRAT arithmetic raw scores.",['Behaviour interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,"['Middle school', 'Secondary/High school']",NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not specified,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 75:\n[¬s]""When the first permission was received, the student was assigned to the treatment group, the second was assigned to the control group, etc. Adjustments were made if students\' schedules did not conform to the schedules of the participating teachers.

40134246,Garaigordobil (1995),1995,"Abstract This study examined the effects of a friendly and cooperative game program on child development in children ages 6 and 7. A pretest/intervention/posttest design was used with a sample of 125 experimental and 53 control subjects. Social behavior in the classroom, self-concept, and academic learning maturity were measured. Treatment consisted of 22 play sessions carried out over one academic year.

It details the early stages of what has now become a Province-wide initiative but which at the time of the study was a major innovation in only two of the educational and library board areas. The evaluation was concerned with the implementation of the project and its impact on the pupils, teachers and schools involved. After an overview of the findings, Part 1 of the main report provides a context for the evaluation and brief details about its design. The two main parts, Part 2 and Part 3, present the findings from the parallel studies, which used qualitative and quantitative methods respectively. Part 2 addresses the overarching question  ‘How is Reading Recovery being implemented in Northern Ireland?’ while Part 3 compares the progress of Reading Recovery pupils with that of other groups of pupils. The overwhelming perception of those involved in the initiative was that Reading Recovery is a valuable addition to a school’s activities, not only because of its benefits for individual pupils but also because of its potential influence on the teaching methods of the teachers and on the schools’ policies and practices in early years’ education. The quantitative aspects of the study show that a typical pupil completing the programme might well remain in the lower half of the class but still be able to access the mainstream activities of the class. However, the results do suggest that in this early stage of the initiative’s development, the gains made by pupils may be less than those reported in certain other studies, and for some pupils may not be as longlasting.

Fewer studies have examined the effects of combining the two strategies even though cognitive theories indicate that true comprehension occurs when certain procedures act upon knowledge constructed from the text being read and ""link"" that knowledge with knowledge in the long-term memory. This study compared subjects receiving strategic knowledge and content knowledge to subjects receiving strategic knowledge only, subjects receiving content-knowledge only, and a control group. Subjects were 9- and 10-year-old students in four fourth-grade classrooms. The design was a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. Subjects were given the comprehension and verbal subtests of the Stanford Achievement Test. Based on these tests, subjects were identified as high- or low-ability readers. In addition, they were given a comprehension pretest designed by the instructor before intervention began. The intervention took place over a 4-week period and consisted of a different series of lessons presented by an independent instructor. After the intervention, subjects took the posttest. SAT subtest scores and pretest scores were used as covariates in the final analysis. Results showed a decrease in the posttest means and no differences among the four experimental groups.

To help students reach standards outlined by the New York State Regents, assessments in English-Language Arts were designed to identify eighth grade students who might not pass English Regents Examinations. Students at risk of failing Regents Examinations are mandated by the New York State Education Department to receive Academic Intervention Services, or AIS. This study investigated the effectiveness of AIS in one school over a period of two years. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between participation in an English Language Arts AIS program and eighth grade student performance on the New York State English Language Arts Assessment. Further, this study explored additional relationships by type of program, faculty involvement and biosocial variables including sex, race, and socio-economic status. This is a quasi-experimental, control-treatment, post intervention study of an AIS program over two years in a suburban middle school on Long Island, New York. Participants included in the study were eighth grade students who were enrolled in the middle school in 1999–2000 and 2000–2001. The treatment group is a sample of 114 AIS students included in this study, 93.4% of the AIS population. Overall, this study revealed no significant differences between control and treatment groups. Girls scored higher than boys, but the sample size for other biosocial variables such as race and socio-economic status was too small to provide useful information. Instruction by full versus part time staff yielded no significant results on ELA mean scores.

Effects were measured using standardized measures of phonological awareness, letter-word identification and word attack skills. The procedure for this study consisted of three phases including a screening phase designed to identify participants for the study, an in-service training for teaching assistants who implemented the treatment intervention, and the intervention implementation. Sixty-three participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control conditions. The performance of the treatment group and the control group was compared. The treatment condition consisted of a 10-minute, one-to-one intervention that included the recommended components of curriculum design for students who are at risk for learning and systematically addressed letter-sound correspondences, blending, segmenting, and the use of onset rimes. The control condition was a traditional, supplemental intervention for students at risk for learning to read. A two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to examine the data and to test for differences within groups and between groups on conceptually similar measures. The amount of change from pretest to posttest was significant for both groups in letter-word identification with a modest effect size of .77 for the control group and a very large effect size of 1.62 for the experimental group. The amount of change from pretest to posttest was also significant for both groups in word attack with a modest effect size of .68 for the control condition and a more robust effect size of 1.58 for the experimental condition. The amount of change from pretest to posttest in phonological awareness was significant for both groups, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups.

(2) Determine if there is a significant difference between students who participated in the bubble program and students who did not. The researcher used quantitative quasi experimental design. The sample population consisted of 232 students in the following subject areas  Algebra I and English I.

Participants were students in three elementary, multi-age general education classes in which students with reading disabilities were included for reading instruction. Students in two experimental classes were instructed in three reading comprehension strategies, Visual Imagery, Self-Questioning, and Paraphrasing, as part of their regularly scheduled social studies instruction over the course of one school year. Two experimental designs were used to measure the effects of the instructional model. First, effects for students with reading disabilities was measured using a multiple-baseline-across-subjects design. Four students with reading disabilities in each of two experimental classrooms participated in small-group instruction on the three reading strategies. Researcher-developed strategy tests were used to determine mastery of each strategy. Additionally, measures of reading achievement on a standardized reading comprehension measure was utilized. Second, effects for all students were measured using a pretest-posttest comparison-group design. Forty-nine students in two experimental and one comparison class participated in instruction in the same reading strategies. Three measures of reading comprehension were utilized, including the strategy tests given to students with reading disabilities, a standardized measure and a curriculum-based measure. Although the classroom teachers did not provide the instruction, they were asked to observe and rate their satisfaction with the model. Results indicated that the instructional model promoted reading comprehension achievement for students with reading disabilities and normally achieving students.

A second purpose was to determine the relationship between attainment of computational skills and the amount of time allocated for the treatment. The subjects were one hundred sixty-two students from seven intact third grade classrooms. Six classes served as the treatment groups and one class served as the non-treatment, comparison group. The treatment groups received MAI or CPT drill and practice on the basic math facts for ten, twenty, or thirty minutes daily as part of the traditional mathematics program. A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was selected. Quantitative and qualitative data collection and analyses were combined in this study. Qualitative methods were used for description, support, and elaboration of the data established through quantitative methods. Computational skill achievement was measured by the Stanford Achievement Test--Mathematics and a microcomputer-generated Math Facts Test. Classroom observations and teacher interviews were used to collect qualitative data related to this study. Filtered through the limitations of the study the finding suggest the following quantitative and qualitative conclusions  (1) MAI may be more effective than CPT. (2) CPT may be more effective than traditional instruction. (3) Students receiving MAI may learn the computational skills more quickly than the students receiving CPT. (4) Twenty minutes of MAI may be the most effective. (5) Computational skill achievement as it relates to SES, achievement levels, and treatment may not be significantly different across all groups.

45336738,Golton (1975) 1 1,1975,"The current paradigm of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) involves the assignment of one student to each computer terminal with virtually no provision for interaction between students. Studies outside of the CAI field comparing students learning alone with students learning in groups have found either no significant differences in achievement or significant differences which favor learning in groups. Since current per student cost of CAI is very high when compared to regular classroom instruction, if students learning in groups at computer terminals can achieve at least at well as students learning individually, the high per student cost of CAI could be substantially reduced without reducing learning efficiency. Further, a comparison of these two modes of learning through CAI may be viewed as a contrast of the connectionist theory of learning (solitary mode) and the configurationist theory of learning (group mode). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare within the domain of CAI the achievement of students learning alone with the achievement of students learning in groups. A sample of 200 sixth grade students from San Francisco elementary schools was randomly partitioned into two experimental groups, named Group S and Group P. The subjects in each group received CAI in Probability and Statistics for a period of ten days, SS minutes per day. Each subject in Group S worked alone at a computer terminal. The subjects in Group P worked in pairs, with each pair using a single computer terminal. The pairs were formed by allowing the subjects free choice of partners. The CAI was prepared by the investigator and included the same content and sequencing for both experimental groups. However, management aspects of the program were modified for Group P to facilitate and encourage cooperation between partners. Equivalency of the two experimental groups was established using two pretests on Probability and Statistics, one measuring knowledge and the other measuring comprehension and application, and two Arithmetic achievement tests from the standardized Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills. There were no statistically significant pre-experimental differences between group means on any of these measures at the 0.0S level. The dependent variables were  (1) the scores on two posttests, one testing knowledge of Probability and Statistics and the other testing comprehension and application of Probability and Statistics. and (2) the scores on two retention tests administered six weeks after instruction. The retention tests were parallel forms of the two posttests. No significant differences between the two treatment groups were found on any of these measures at the 0.0S level. Furthermore, no significant differences were found between treatments when the data was analyzed by sex (boys, girls) and by mathematics ability level (high, middle, low). Thus, neither instructional aode nor corresponding learning theory was instrumental in bringing about greater learning. Both treatment groups had significantly higher mean scores on the posttests than on the corresponding pretests. Comparisons also were made on two measures of performance during the CAI lessons, total responses and correct ainiaua lesson responses.

38296617,Gorard (2014),2014,"Switch-on Reading is an intensive 10-week literacy intervention. It is delivered on a one to one basis by staff, most commonly teaching assistants, who have been trained in the approach. The purpose of Switch-on is to achieve functional literacy for as many pupils as possible, and so to close the reading achievement gap for vulnerable children working below age-expected levels. It is inspired by the well- established intervention Reading Recovery, which is teacher led and delivered over a 12-20 week period. In this evaluation, the programme involved regular sessions for pupils who had not achieved Level 4 English at Key Stage 2. The identified pupils in Year 7 attended regular 20-minute reading sessions over the course of the Spring term. The students were removed from class to attend the sessions, which aimed to improve their reading comprehension and fluency. Each session required students to read from four different books graded on the basis of their difficulty. Training and support for staff was provided by the Every Child a Reader staff of Nottinghamshire Local Authority. The overall result was an effect size of +0.24, based on the pooled standard deviation of the post-test score for both groups, meaning that the programme made a noticeable positive impact. This effect can be envisaged as suggesting that on average pupils receiving the intervention would make approximately three additional months’ progress over the course of a year compared to similar pupils who did not. The evaluation identified positive results for all groups of pupils (defined by sex, first language, ethnicity, special educational needs, free school meal eligibility and measured attainment at the outset). However, it is important to note that conclusions about specific groups of pupils are more tentative than the overall finding, because the study was primarily designed to test the average impact on all identified children.","['Teaching assistants', 'One to one tuition', 'Phonics']",NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12']",NA,NA,,19,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""19 schools[¬e]""']",,,19,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""19 schools[¬e]""']",,19,"['Page 6:\n[¬s]"" in 19 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],Y7 classes from 19 secondary schools.,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 10:\n[¬s]"" Nineteen schools were recruited to take part in the intervention.

Pupils attending the four-week programme followed a specially designed curriculum involving regular literacy and numeracy lessons taught by trained primary and secondary school teachers. Lessons were supported by mentors and peer-mentors and generally conducted in small teaching groups. Each afternoon, pupils participated in a variety of sports and enrichment activities. The programme took place across three sites in London and the South East  Brighton, Enfield and Islington in the summer of 2013. It was targeted at pupils in Years 5 and 6 who were eligible for free school meals (FSM) and at pupils who had not achieved Level 4 in English or maths at the end of Key Stage (KS) 2. In 2012, Future Foundations developed, organised and piloted the summer school on one site, in Enfield. Recommendations from the formative evaluation of this pilot, also funded by the Education Endowment Foundation informed the development of the 2013 summer school. The overall result on English outcomes was an effect size of +0.17. This effect can be envisaged as suggesting that on average pupils receiving the intervention would make approximately two additional months’ progress over the course of a year compared to similar pupils who did not.

The US Department of Education (1996) reports indicated that Black adolescent males are at greater risk for school failure and delinquency  the US Department of Corrections (1996) reported that Black adolescent males are at greater risk for incarceration  and the US Department of Justice (1996) crime statistics showed that Black adolescent males have a higher mortality rate when compared to same-aged cohorts of different ethnic backgrounds. Highlighted here is the interplay between structural, historical, situational, and individual factors that impede on the success of Black males in the academic environment. As a result of the above, some resources and attention have attempted to address and redress the inadequate performance in our schools by Black males. One program implemented to counter the effects of continued failure and underachievement of Black males is the Benjamin E. Mays Institute (BEMI) mentoring program. Its main goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring to young Black males. Through individual contact, emphasis on cultural strengths and pride, and single-sex instruction, this program acts as a buffer to the negative images of what Black manhood means to these young men. This investigation explored the relationship between ethnic/racial identity development, racial socialization, academic disidentification, and academic achievement for 102, 7th and 8th grade Black males. Significant group differences were observed in ethnic identity development, racial socialization, academic identification, and academic achievement between the Benjamin E. Mays Institute (BEMI) mentored students and the comparison group of non-mentored students (NMCG) who attended Lewis Fox Middle School. In general, this investigation revealed that involvement in the BEMI mentoring program had a positive affect on ethnic/racial identity search, commitment, and development for students involved in the BEMI program. In addition to the positive impact on ethnic/racial identity development, there appeared to be positive racial socialization messages for the BEMI students. One area of success demonstrated by the BEMI students was in academic performance. The BEMI students received significantly higher academic grades and scores on the Connecticut Mastery Test (CMT). Further, these students expressed having a stronger attachment to their academic success and its importance. These messages were from a number of spheres which included home and school.

40134589,Gottfredson (1986),1986,"Project PATHE (Positive Action Through Holistic Education) was a 3-year delinquency prevention program implemented in seven schools by the Charleston County, Maryland public school system between 1980 and 1983. An evaluation of the PATHE program was conducted which compared PATHE schools to two non-PATHE schools. Year-to-year differences in the PATHE school averages on measures of the project goals were also examined. The results suggest that the direct student services implemented did not reduce delinquent behavior, but did increase commitment to education as indicated by dropout, retention, and graduation rates, and by standardized achievement test scores. The program was found to have been effective in improving school climate. Students in the program schools grew more attached to their schools and perceived an increase in both the fairness of school rules and the extent to which their schools were characterized by planning and action. Students also developed more positive self-concepts, reported more belief in rules, had fewer suspensions, had lower levels of alienation, and reported their schools to be safer. The evidence supports the conclusion that the program represents an effective model for reducing several risk factors for delinquent behavior for the school population as a whole, and for increasing educational outcomes for high-risk individuals.

The QuickSmart instructional program consists of three structured, teacher- or teacher aide-directed, 30-minute, small-group lessons each week for approximately 26 weeks. In this study, 42 middle school students experiencing learning difficulties (LD) completed the QuickSmart reading program, and a further 42 students with LD took part in the QuickSmart mathematics program. To investigate the effects of the intervention, comparisons were made between the reading and mathematics progress of the intervention group and a group of 10 high-achieving and 10 average-achieving peers. The results indicated that although the standardized reading comprehension and mathematics scores of QuickSmart students remained below those of comparison students, they improved significantly from pretest to posttest.  In contrast, the standardized scores of comparison students were not significantly different from pretest to posttest. On measures of response speed and accuracy gathered using the Cognitive Aptitude Assessment System (CAAS), QuickSmart students were able to narrow the gap between their performance and that of their high- and average-achieving peers.

47269808,Grant (1995) SEL,1995,"Statement of the problem. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of social skills training on the self-concept, academic achievement, and discipline of fifth grade students. Specifically, this study investigated following questions  (1) Does social skills training affect the self-concept of fifth grade students?  (2) Does social skills training affect the academic achievement of fifth grade students?  (3) Does social skills training affect the discipline of fifth grade students? Procedure. Following a review of the professional literature, permission to conduct research with students enrolled in fifth grade was secured from the administrator of a public intermediate school in South Carolina. The entire fifth grade, which consisted of 181 students, served as the population for the study. This population was located in a rural intermediate school with a total enrollment of 748 students in grades 4-6. Students were placed in the experimental group or in the control group based on random selection of all fifth grade classes. Subjects assigned to the experimental group participated in the 18-week New Model Me Program, a social skills training intervention. All participants were administered the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory before and after the social skills training. The T-test was used to analyze the difference between the pretest and posttest scores for the experimental group and the control group. Results. Although both the experimental group and the control group exhibited similar levels of self-esteem before the social skills training, the experimental group showed a statistically significant increase after the social skills intervention. The results of the comparison of the first semester and second semester academic grade point average of the experimental group and the control group showed that there was no significant increase in academic achievement for the experimental nor control group. The mean posttest score for the experimental group was 84.90, while the mean posttest score for the control group was 81.87. This difference was not statistically significant at the.05 level. The results of the comparison of the number of disciplinary referrals for the first semester and the second semester showed the experimental group reduced its number of referrals and the control group's average number of referrals increased. The difference between the pretest and posttest mean scores for the experimental group was found to be significant at the.05 level. Conclusion. The results of this study indicated that social skills training had a significant positive effect on the self-esteem and discipline of fifth grade students  however, there was no significant effect on academic achievement.

43090155,Graup (1985) RC,1985,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether the collaborative endeavor of the group and strategies which increase student's generation of cognitive questions can serve to enhance comprehension and result in broader more interpretive written response to literature. Subjects were 32, sixth grade students assigned to discussion groups with or without instruction in question generation  and individuals with or without with instruction in question generation. Students in each three phases of the study read a different literary text, generated questions, and wrote essays. Only the instructional groups received instruction in the generation of inferential questions. The questions generated by all four groups were used for either group discussion or required independent written answers. An assessment was made to determine the effectiveness of question instruction as compared to those who received no instruction  group discussion's influence on the individual compared to individuals responding independently to the questions  and whether an ability to answer higher ordered questions would subsume an ability to answer lower level questions. The findings indicated  (1) Discussion groups evidenced better comprehension than individuals. When all conditions were compared, the groups did better than individuals who did not receive instruction. Organization of group versus individual was significant for comprehension. Instruction in question generation was not. (2) Students who received instruction produced significantly more inferential and fewer literal and total questions. (3) There was no relationship between the number and type of questions generated and comprehension. (4) Students who wrote more inferential questions, discussion groups, and no-discussion individuals who received instruction in question generation produced a greater number of interpretive responses in their essays. (5) Question types ranged taxonomically and students responded to them in kind. Students were able to answer questions on and below their ability level but could not succeed with higher level questions. It was concluded that comprehension could be facilitated through collaborative learning and the strategy of reader generated questions. Actively engaging students in the comprehension process led to improved comprehension and broader more interpretive essays. Also ascertained was that students' ability to answer higher lever question subsumed their ability to answer lower level ones.",['Reading comprehension strategies'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 136:\n[¬s]"" elementary school[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12']","['Page 136:\n[¬s]"" sixth grade students[¬e]""']",NA,,1,"['Page 136:\n[¬s]""an e l e m e n t a r y s c h o o l[¬e]""']",,,1,"['Page 136:\n[¬s]""an e l e m e n t a r y s c h o o l[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 136:\n[¬s]""an e l e m e n t a r y s c h o o l[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,3,"['Page 136:\n[¬s]""t h r e e classes[¬e]""']",,3,,"['Page 136:\n[¬s]""t h r e e classes[¬e]""']",3,"['Page 136:\n[¬s]""t h r e e classes[¬e]""']",['not_provided'],The study involved 3 classes randomly assigned to 4 groups.

Of the single cohort of kindergarten students (N = 35) participating, eight students received fall intervention from a trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and winter intervention using ""Road to the Code"" and six students received winter intervention from the trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"". The first research question investigated early literacy skills achievement, as measured by the Dynamic Indicator of Basic Literacy Skills, between treatment and comparison groups using two commercially available interventions  ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and ""Road to the Code"". The second research question examined learner characteristics and demographics as explanatory variables for early literacy skills achievement of the study sample. Study findings indicate that all treatment participants made statistically significant gains in early literacy skills achievement, generally kept pace with their non-at-risk peers, but that neither treatment closed the achievement gap between at-risk and not-at-risk for reading difficulty participants.

Treatment fidelity examination indicates that the treatment was implemented with fidelity. Study recommendations include investigations into the impact of core reading instruction on early literacy skills in order to determine efficient intervention programming that supplements classroom instruction for specifically identified populations (e.g., Hispanic males residing in a single parent household) and longitudinal kindergarten cohort data collection of reading achievement on district-wide measurements in order to develop longevity data as related to later reading difficulty and relationship to treatment efficacy, additional supplemental services, and learner characteristics/demographics.

40642414,Green (1963) 1_1,1963,"THE JOPLIN PLAN (2) is an administrative device for reducing the heterogeneity in reading skill of a group during instruction in reading. A reading period is set aside for pupils in, say, grades 4, 5, and 6, during which these students leave their regular classes and join others in these grades whose reading level is approximately comparable to their own.

The subjects were randomly selected high school students at one local high school who were between the ages of 14 and 18, who had been retained at least once, and were reading below the ninth grade level. The treatment in this study consisted of  (1) modeling by the teacher in proper reading aloud and tutoring behaviors  (2) repetitive oral reading of storybooks appropriate to second grade students  and (3) reading storybooks to second grade students. Pretest and posttest data consisted of scaled scores on the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test, Blue Level, Forms G and H, in addition to a reading attitude survey and self concept survey designed by the researcher. The research was experimental in nature with a pretest-posttest control group design utilized. Data analysis was interpreted using independent and paired sample t-tests comparing pre and post scores for each student and gain scores for the two groups. The findings indicated that the students who participated in the experimental group scored significantly higher in reading fluency and evidenced a more positive self-concept than those of the control group.

37133918,Gudbrandsen (2005) PT,2005,"Although the direct instruction of cognitive and metacognitive strategies in reading has been found effective in improving students' cognition and affect, there are virtually no studies that attempt to study how, and in what situations, students might construct knowledge of reading strategies and their use. The purpose of this study was to systematically observe middle school tutors' use of reading strategies while tutoring primary students and compare the strategies that tutors, with and without metacognitive guidance, used. It was further designed to assess the impact that tutoring and knowledge about reading as a problem-solving activity had on 5th and 6th-grade tutors' strategy knowledge and use, reading comprehension, and attitude. Sixty-two elementary students participated over 11-weeks, 43 students as tutors and 19 as nontutors. To examine both tutoring and metacognitive effects, half of the tutors were guided in reading as a problem solving activity (+RPS tutors), while others tutored with no guidance (-RPS). A third group of students were guided in RPS but did not tutor (RPS only). It was hypothesized that +RPS tutors would make greater gains than -RPS tutors, and tutors would make greater gains than would nontutors. Students were pre- and posttested on experimental measures of reading strategy knowledge and use, reading comprehension, and attitude towards reading and tutoring. Thirty-three tutoring sessions were systematically observed during which the strategy use of seven +RPS tutors and eight -RPS tutors were recorded. Tutors were observed to implement an array of strategies. The two brief metacognitive sessions on thinking about reading as problem solving appeared to have an impact on students' tutoring  +RPS tutors used significantly more decoding strategies while tutoring than their -RPS counterparts. However, +RPS tutors did not, generally, maintain the greater strategy use when resolving problems to their own reading.

Students, teaching assistants and teachers involved were also interviewed about the use of OVIP, the perceived processes and outcomes. Assessment results showed that OVIP was associated with greater gains in word reading than these students' usual teaching/intervention approaches. Those interviewed also experienced benefits associated with using OVIP. It was further found that word reading gains were not related to a measure of being at risk of significant literacy difficulties. Participants identified the use of their own voice, the student's agency and working at their own pace as key factors relevant to how OVIP worked. These factors aligned with a working OVIP programme theory.

Two single-track, year-round elementary schools (kindergarten through grade 5) were established in Durham (North Carolina). One school adopted a core knowledge curriculum, while the other chose a more traditional approach. Both were attendance zone schools, rather than magnet schools, but in both cases a majority of parents had to approve the year-round concept and parents were allowed to send their children to other schools. Evaluation data supported the conclusion that the year-round schools had a significant positive effect on the achievement of students. There was also reason to believe that instructional planning at the school level was improved by the need to coordinate assessment and remediation services. Although disadvantaged students did not participate in the enrichment programs and the remediation programs between the sessions to the extent planners had hoped, those students who did receive the inter-session remediation were better prepared to resume their educations after breaks.

Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure  however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies.

39253318,Harlow (2001),2001,"Wake Summerbridge is an enrichment program that has supported selected WCPSS middle school students for a number of years. This evaluation compared subsequent academic performance, suspensions and dropout rates of students who had participated in the program with a comparison group of students with similar characteristics who did not participate in the program. The main positive finding was that dropout rates were much lower for Summerbridge students than for the comparison group (1% versus 13%). Achievement scores and grade point averages showed a slight but consistent advantage in absolute terms for Summerbridge students over the comparison group. The differences were not statistically significant, although they may have some educational significance. The percentage of students receiving F’s and suspension rates actually favored the comparison group. However, the higher dropout rate among comparison students may account for the lower number of F’s earned by this group. Some cautions must be kept in mind when interpreting these findings.

37671562,Hatcher (2006),2006,"Background  This study evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention for reading-delayed children in Year-1 classes. Methods  A sample (N = 77) of children drawn from 14 schools representing those with the weakest reading skills were randomly allocated to one of two groups. A 20-week intervention group received the intervention for two consecutive 10-week periods, while a 10-week intervention group only received the intervention for the second 10 weeks of the study. The programme was delivered in daily 20-minute sessions that alternated between small group (N = 3) and individual teaching. The programme combined phoneme awareness training, word and text reading, and phonological linkage exercises. Results  The children receiving the intervention during the first 10-week period made significantly more progress on measures of letter knowledge, single word reading, and phoneme awareness than children not receiving the intervention. However, the children who only received the intervention during the second 10-week period made rapid progress and appeared to catch up with the children who had been given the more prolonged intervention. Failure to respond to the intervention was predicted by poor initial literacy skills and being in receipt of free school meals. Conclusion  A reading intervention programme delivered on a daily basis by trained teaching assistants is an effective intervention for children who show reading delays at the end of their first year in school. However, around one-quarter of the children did not respond to this intervention and these children would appear to need more intensive or more prolonged help to improve their reading skills.

DESIGN  Nonrandomized controlled trial with follow-up 6 years after intervention. SETTING  Public elementary schools serving high-crime areas in Seattle, Wash. PARTICIPANTS  Of the fifth-grade students enrolled in participating schools, 643 (76%) were given written parental consent for the longitudinal study and 598 (93%) were followed up and interviewed at age 18 years. INTERVENTIONS  A full intervention provided in grades 1 through 6 of 5 days of in-service training for teachers each intervention year, developmentally appropriate parenting classes offered to parents when children were in grades 1 through 3 and 5 through 6, and developmentally adjusted social competence training for children in grades 1 and 6. A late intervention, provided in grades 5 and 6 only, paralleled the full intervention at these grades. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Self-reported violent and nonviolent crime, substance use, sexual activity, pregnancy, bonding to school, school achievement, grade repetition and school dropout, suspension and/or expulsion, and school misbehavior  delinquency charges from court records  grade point average  California Achievement Test scores  and disciplinary action reports from school records. RESULTS  Fewer students receiving full intervention than control students reported violent delinquent acts (48.3% vs 59.7%  P=.04), heavy drinking (15.4% vs 25.6%  P=.04), sexual intercourse (72.1% vs 83.0%  P=.02), having multiple sex partners (49.7% vs 61.5%  P=.04), and pregnancy or causing pregnancy (17.1% vs 26.4%  P=.06) by age 18 years. The full intervention student group reported more commitment (P=.03) and attachment (P=.006) to school, better academic achievement (P=.01), and less school misbehavior (P=.02) than control students. Late intervention in grades 5 and 6 only did not significantly affect health-risk behaviors in adolescence. CONCLUSIONS  A package of interventions with teachers, parents, and children provided throughout the elementary grades can have enduring effects in reducing violent behavior, heavy drinking, and sexual intercourse by age 18 years among multiethnic urban children. Results are consistent with the theoretical model guiding the intervention and support efforts to reduce health-risk behaviors through universal interventions in selected communities or schools serving high-crime neighborhoods.",['Social and emotional learning'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""Public elementary schools[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""A full intervention provided in grades\n1 through 6 of 5 days of in-service training for teachers\neach intervention year, developmentally appropriate\nparenting classes offered to parents when children were\nin grades 1 through 3 and 5 through 6, and developmen-\ntally adjusted social competence training for children in\ngrades 1 and 6.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '16', '17', '14', '15', '18']","['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Data were collected from group-administered question-\nnaires completed by children in the fall of1985 just after en-\ntering fifth grade, and from Seattle School District records.\nOutcome data were collected through individually adminis-\ntered interviews conducted in the spring of 1993.

The study of the CAKE program had four research components  (a) indicators of school success (GPA, attendance, and attitudes toward school) were compared between at-risk students and those not at-risk  (b) indicators of school success were analyzed over the time at-risk students were mentored to find any significant change  (c) indicators of school success and enrollment status at graduation was compared between students at-risk, with and without mentors  and (d) participants' perceptions of the mentoring program, using a researcher-constructed questionnaire given to mentees and mentors to determine activities that were successful and those which needed reevaluation. Using analysis of covariance, the findings showed  (a) a significant difference $(p < .05)$ in attitudes, GPA, and attendance at the beginning of the study between two groups of students identified as at-risk and not at-risk  (b) a significant difference $(p < .05)$ in attitude toward school at the end of Year 1 between those students at-risk with mentors scoring higher than at-risk without mentors and not at-risk students  (c) GPA and attendance declined for at-risk students, with or without mentors, although at-risk students with a mentor seemed to lessen the decline  and (d) no significant differences $(p < .05)$ in GPA and attendance between at-risk with or without mentors, although more at-risk students with mentors continued in school or received GEDs after four years.

The purpose of this research study was to understand how summer school affects reading, writing, and math achievement. A follow-up study was used to measure the long-term effects of summer school participation as students neared the completion of seventh grade. The core question which guided this research was the following  Is there a statistically significant difference between achievement of sixth grade students who attended and those who did not attend a middle school summer program focused on reading, writing, and mathematics? Data collection consisted of test scores from the Terra Nova Complete Test Battery (CTB) in the form of pretest and posttest and the Missouri Assessment Program used to measure the long-term effects of summer participation. Data were collected from 60 sixth grade students, 30 treatment and 30 comparison, over a period of an academic school year. Data analysis involved examining test scores from the Terra Nova standardized test and the Missouri Assessment Program. Analysis revealed that the students involved in the middle school summer program showed a statistically significant gain in Language Arts on measures of writing achievement. In reading and math, no statistically significant gains were found. The follow-up study did not find a statistically significant gain in the long-term effects of summer school participation as students neared the completion of seventh grade. Even though the results of this research did not provide a definitive answer to the question of effectiveness of summer school programs, the implications of this study are useful.

In Study 1, 116 sixth graders completed researcher-developed measures of comprehension and monitoring, and a self-report inventory of frequency of strategy use. Results indicated a significant correlation between error detection, used as a measure of monitoring behavior, and reading comprehension scores. Self-reports of strategy use were not correlated with any other measures. In Study 2, 63 sixth graders participated in one of three groups  control, question-response (QR), or thinking aloud (TA). They completed 15 lessons during which students in the experimental conditions read science passages with embedded errors intended to trigger monitoring and strategy use. Instructors used participant verbalizations to focus instruction on areas of concern using contingent support. Pre- and post-test measures included the Gates-MacGinitie, and all Study 1 measures. Whereas quantitative results indicated that the QR intervention had more positive impact on reading comprehension, thinking aloud did allow instructors to observe the existing strategy use and background knowledge of participants. Sixth graders failed to notice their comprehension breakdowns, a step that must precede repair activities.

The study also compared the monetary cost of ICARE to traditional reading intervention programs. ICARE encompassed rural elementary schools in a single school system. Three cohorts of students who participated in ICARE were studied. The total number of students was 334. Data were obtained through various testing programs already in place in the school district. Achievement indicators included a district-wide reading assessment, the reading section of the California Achievement Test, and an informal screening assessment. Academic performance indicators included special education referral rates, grade retentions, and reading grades.

Eighty-four students in fourth- and fifth-grade evidencing poor performance in mathematics were selected. Students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions  RPT plus Parent Involvement (PI), RPT Only, and Control. Prior to the interventions, students completed both curriculum-based and standardized computation measures. Measures of school adjustment were completed by the students and their teachers. Additionally, parents completed a measure assessing their level of participation in their children's learning experiences. Following the intervention, all measures were re-administered and student, parent, and teacher satisfaction were assessed. Analyses of covariance indicated that students who received the RPT intervention in combination with a parent involvement intervention displayed the highest levels of accurate computations. Repeated measures ANCOVAs of school adjustment measures showed that RPT plus PI students received higher teacher ratings of positive academic and social behaviors than did Controls. Students involved in both RPT conditions perceived themselves as more socially confident with peers than did Controls. The measure assessing parent participation was found to be unreliable and was not used to assess pretest-posttest differences between groups. Students, parents, and teachers were highly satisfied with both RPT interventions. These results replicate previous findings in which participation in the RPT intervention yielded significantly higher academic gains in mathematics than non-participation. Findings extend previous research by indicating the greater effectiveness of RPT when combined with active parent involvement.

Also studied were the effects of planned parental involvement in the affective education program. Five classrooms at each of two schools were randomly assigned to one of three groups  (a) affective education program, (b) affective education program with planned parental involvement, (c) control group. The students were pre- and posttested measuring  (a) self-esteem, (b) intellectual achievement responsibility (IAR), a locus of control measure, (c) alternative-thinking, (d) reading comprehension. To control for bias in regards to the self-esteem and IAR measures, the students were administered the Children's Social Desirability Questionnaire. Documentation was recorded by the researcher on (a) student fights, (b) teacher/student arguments, (c) self-initiated parent contacts, and (d) student self-referrals to the guidance counselor. Using the Toward Affective Development Program (TAD), treatment group I was involved in 23 weekly sessions, 30 minutes per session. In addition to TAD, treatment II involved newsletters and a reading seminar for parents of students. The treatment group with planned parental involvement demonstrated significantly higher gains on the self-esteem measure than control group (Group III). There were no significant differences noted between groups I and III, and I and II. Treatment groups I and II made significantly higher gains on the alternative-thinking measure than the control group. Treatment group II demonstrated the highest gain. There were no significant differences noted among the groups in intellectual achievement responsibility scores. Treatment group II reported significantly higher gains in reading achievement than the control group. There were no significant differences indicated between groups I, and II, and I and III. There were significant differences found in the percentages of fights and teacher/student arguments reported among the groups.

The study looked closely at the backgrounds of participating youth and their mentors, the mentoring relationships that formed, the program supports that were offered, and the benefits that youth accrued--and assessed how these varied for youth with differing ""profiles"" of risk. Five key findings resulted  (1) Without substantial effort beyond their normal outreach strategies, programs were able to reach and serve youth facing a wide range of challenges  (2) Youth with differing risk ""profiles"" (that is, levels and types of risk) had relationships of similar strength and duration and derived similar benefits from program participation  (3) The challenges reported by mentors and the reasons matches ended differed as a function of youth's risk profile  (4) The strongest program benefit, and most consistent across risk groups, was a reduction in depressive symptoms--a particularly noteworthy finding given that almost one in four youth reported worrisome levels of these symptoms at baseline. Findings also suggested gains in social acceptance, academic attitudes and grades. Youth did not appear to benefit in their relationships with parents or in their positive or negative behaviors  and (5) Mentors who received early-match training and consistent program support met more frequently and had longer-lasting relationships with their mentees. Youth whose mentors received training also reported higher-quality relationships. The authors believe the study's results provide useful guidance for practitioners, funders, and policymakers who want to know which youth are best suited for mentoring and how practices might be strengthened to help ensure that youth facing a variety of risks get the most out of their mentoring experience.

37133921,Hilger (2000),2000,"This study investigated the impact of a cross-age tutoring program on high-school tutors' and third-grade tutees' reading achievement and attitudes toward reading and school. In addition to investigating overall program effects, the impact of ongoing group support for tutors and the impact of students' previous achievement levels were considered. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to analyze data. The 14-week intervention consisted of 48 tutoring sessions, involving 25 tutors and 46 tutees. Tutees demonstrated greater gains in reading achievement and attitudes toward school than did their peers who were not tutored  however, gains were not demonstrated across all measures. Intervention involvement was related to rates of change of curriculum-based measurement, teacher ratings of students' reading skills, and teacher ratings of students' attitudes toward school. In each case, tutees' change scores were greater than those of comparison students. Intervention involvement was not significantly related to rates of change on a computerized reading test, student ratings of their own attitudes toward reading, or teacher ratings of students' attitudes toward reading. Among high-school students, intervention involvement was not related to rates of change on achievement measures, but was related to rates of change on two of ten attitude scales—Anxiety and Concentration. In both cases, comparison students outperformed tutors. Tutors' participation in ongoing support groups was not related to their rates of change on achievement measures or their tutees' rates of change on achievement or attitude measures. Group participation was related to rates of change on three attitude scales—Time Management, Anxiety, and Test Strategies—with tutors receiving ongoing group support outperforming those who did not. There was a significant interaction between elementary students' prior achievement levels, intervention involvement, and CBM rate of change. Tutees outperformed comparison students across achievement levels, with the largest discrepancies occurring among high-achieving students. Tutees' rates of change on achievement and attitude measures were not significantly related to their tutors' prior achievement levels. Program satisfaction was high among tutors and tutees.

With regard to the standardized test data, it was concluded that summer school had no effect on children's achievement in either reading or math in the regular school year. The affective instrumentation used in the study provided conclusive results with respect to teachers, parents and students viewing the summer school experience in a positive manner. Attendance data derived from the regular school years and the summer school program was insignificant.

The hypotheses tested here are, first, that ability grouping raises the aggregate level of student achievement and, second, that ability grouping achieves this end by increasing the learning of all students. Comparing average student achievement growth from the seventh to the ninth grades in grouped and non-grouped schools shows that overall gains from ability grouping in either subject are negligible, controlling for differences in student social background and initial levels of achievement. Comparing the achievement growth of non-grouped students and high- and low-group students shows that high-group placement generally has a weak positive effect while low-group placement has a stronger negative effect.

In order to address the needs of these students, community organizations such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America have implemented mentoring programs. Recognizing the needs of their students, school systems have recently begun to implement mentoring programs using their own staff as mentors. In general, research exploring the effectiveness of these programs is lacking. Research that has been published is often not experimental in nature. This study utilized an experimental approach to explore the effectiveness of a middle school mentoring program aimed at meeting the needs of academically and behaviorally at-risk students. During the duration of the mentoring intervention, the mentored students (n = 40) significantly increased their self-concepts over those of the non-mentored (n = 39) and comparison (n = 38) students. No differences were found between the groups on measures of academic outcomes and self-reported problem behaviors. The mentored and non-mentored students did not significantly differ in their post-intervention teacher rated problem behaviors, social skills, or learning behaviors. Post hoc testing revealed that effectively mentored students significantly improved their grades over that of ineffectively mentored students. In several areas of self-concept, it was the effectively mentored students, rather than mentored students in general, who made significant gains. The integrity of the mentoring relationships needs to be monitored to ensure that the programs are being implemented as intended. Investment in the relationships by both the mentors and mentees appears to be an important factor in obtaining desirable results.

Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) writing achievement scores from the 2010 administration were utilized for this study. The independent variable for the study was the usage of an AWE program. The dependent variable for the study was TCAP writing achievement scores. In this study, the TCAP writing achievement scores of two groups of eighth grade students from each school were analyzed and compared. School A was the experimental group that received AWE as a treatment, and School B was the control group that did not utilize AWE as part of its writing instruction. Both schools were from similar demographic backgrounds. This study took place in rural, upper middle Tennessee. Four research questions with corresponding null hypotheses guided this study. The first three null hypotheses related to the following variables  comparison of control group and experimental group, economically disadvantaged students, and gender. For these three null hypotheses, an ANCOVA test was performed at the 0.05 level of significance. The covariate for these tests was pre-test data. The first null hypothesis dealt with the comparison of the experimental group and the control group and was rejected due to the statistically significant difference in TCAP writing scores. The second and third null hypotheses dealt with economically disadvantaged students and the gender of students, respectively, with the use of AWE. Both of these null hypotheses were retained due to no statistically significant difference in TCAP writing scores between the comparison groups. The last null hypothesis pertained to special education students and the use of AWE. Nonparametric tests were utilized for this subgroup with no statistically significant difference being found between these two groups. Therefore, the fourth null hypothesis was retained. From the study, one may conclude that students who participate in AWE programs do increase in writing achievement more than students who do not participate in AWE programs as part of their writing instruction. One recommendation for practice is that teachers should understand the value of AWE programs when working with students of different ability levels.

Because urban minority youth have a higher incidence of high school dropout, the current study investigated whether a 5-month, school-based cognitive-behavioral mentoring intervention delivered by school personnel during the second half of the ninth grade could enhance high-risk (i.e., students with low grades, attendance, and/or discipline problems) urban minority youths' school engagement.

Reports of relationship quality from mentored participants and mentors showed different patterns of relationships to changes in mentored participants' school-related cognitions (i.e., academic motivation, sense of school belonging, academic self-efficacy, decision-making, and goal-setting) and behavioral outcomes (i.e., attendance, discipline referrals, grades). Finally, contrary to previous research and the study's hypothesis, there was no relationship between changes in school-related cognitions (e.g., academic motivation, self-efficacy) and changes in academic achievement in the participants. These findings indicate that mentors may be able to forestall declines in high-risk, urban minority youths' bonding to school, perceptions of teacher support, and decision-making. Moreover, school-related cognitions may be more distally related to changes in academic achievement in these youth, or school-related cognitions may not be associated achievement at all.

40134623,Hoover (1985),1985,"Scope and Method of Study. Recent research has indicated that impulsive children display academic and behavior problems resulting from the inefficient use of cognitive styles. The literature also suggests that impulsive cognitive style may be modified through verbal self-instruction. This study attempts to determine if such training based on daily school work could be carried on effectively by the child's teacher and could this instruction generalize to five cognitive styles  classroom behavior, impulsivity, field dependence, successive cognitive processing, and simultaneous cognitive processing. In order to test empirically these two concepts, students and teachers were randomly assigned to classes. Teachers from one class in each grade provided verbal self-instruction training to students classified as impulsive. The remainder of the classes served as the control group. The students were tested prior to and after the eight week treatment to determine the difference of each group on the five cognitive styles. Findings and Conclusions. The conclusion of the present study was that self-instruction training was only effective with the modification of self-control. Verbal self-instruction training did not generalize, and was not an effective technique for modifying field dependence, impulsivity, and simultaneous and successive cognitive processing. The result of this study and the equivocal results of previous verbal self-instruction training studies carried on in the classroom may indicate that classroom training by paraprofessionals and the use of academic materials may not be an effective means for altering these cognitive styles.

Results document that the training and technical assistance were functionally related to improved implementation of universal-level SWPBS practices. Improved use of SWPBS was functionally related to improvements in the perceived safety of the school setting and the proportion of third graders meeting or exceeding state reading assessment standards.

39253321,Howes (1989),1989,"The intent of this study was to determine whether regression in reading achievement occurs over the summer between first and second grade and to investigate the effect of two different summer programs. Achievement scores of a group of 201 students for May and October were analyzed according to sex and the Cognitive Skills Index (CSI) level. These children were divided into three groups. The first group received no summer intervention, the second group attended a school-sponsored summer school program, and the third group completed a public library summer reading program. The results of the data analysis are as follows  All children appear to have a significant gain between Gates MacGinitie Tests given in May and October  thus, it is concluded that there is no summer regression. Of the two intervention techniques, the gain shown by children attending summer school is low, but these children were placed in the program because of low achievement. On the other hand, there was a mean gain for all children completing the public library summer reading program. Unfortunately this gain is not uniform  i.e., girls benefit more than boys, and the high CSI group benefit most of all. Even the low CSI group made considerable progress. The group to benefit least are the boys. There is a general tendency for vocabulary to improve more than comprehension for boys and the reverse trend for girls. If the choice has to be made between summer school and the public library summer reading program, then the library program can be considered more successful and cost effective. It is true that summer school attendees are often low achievers, but there is reason to believe that, properly motivated, a library program would be at least equally effective. As in many other studies, girls have been shown to achieve significantly higher scores than boys at this age level, possibly due to the author's observation that academic materials and school environment are more suited to girls than boys.

Over the course of implementation, it is intended that there is a natural progression in terms of the types of rewards given (from tangible rewards such as stickers to more abstract rewards such as free time), how long the game is played for (from 10 minutes to a whole lesson), at what frequency (from three times a week to every day), and when rewards are given (at the end of the game, the end of the day, and the end of the week). Teachers receive two days of initial training, with one day of follow-up training midway through the first year of implementation.

The study was conducted in 10 full-day kindergarten classrooms in 9 schools in an urban school district in western Canada. All children (N = 30) were not yet reading words and demonstrated deficits in phonological and letter-sound awareness. Children were randomly assigned into 2 groups  (a) a phonological awareness intervention group or (b) a no-intervention control group. Educational assistants were trained to provide phonological and letter-sound awareness intervention in 20-minute lessons, five times per week in groups of 2 children, for 14 weeks. Additionally, all students received classroom phonological awareness programming. Lessons were scripted and contained examples, practice, and review. Children were assessed at pre-intervention on three phonological awareness and three alphabetic measures. Probes were administered at three points during the intervention and at two post-intervention maintenance points. Results indicated statistically significant group performance for children in the intervention group on measures of initial sound fluency, phonemic segmentation, and nonsense word fluency skills using measures designed to show change in these skills over time. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the norm-referenced, standardized measures of phonological awareness and print knowledge and on letter naming fluency at the end of the intervention. The data provide evidence to support the clinical practice of the provision of small group, direct, explicit, and intense phonological and letter-sound awareness intervention supplementary to whole class phonological awareness programming for kindergarten children with moderate to severe language impairment.

37671605,Hund-Reid (2013),2013,"Purpose  This study investigated the effectiveness of phonological awareness (PA) intervention in improving the PA skills of kindergarten children with moderate to severe language impairment. Method  Thirty-seven kindergarten children aged between 4 9 and 6 3 (years months) who demonstrated moderate to severe receptive or expressive or total language skills and low PA skills were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 22) and received PA and letter-sound awareness intervention or a no intervention control group (n = 15). The intervention was implemented by educational assistants in groups of two children for 14 weeks, 20 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for a total 67 days. Participants received an average of 18.45 hours of intervention (SD 4.64, range 12.75-21.5 hours) that focused on initial sound identification, phonemic segmentation and blending, and letter-sound awareness. Results  Participants in the experimental group made significantly greater gains than those in the control group on measures of initial sound fluency, phonemic segmentation fluency, and nonsense word fluency. Results were maintained for at least one month after intervention. Conclusion  Kindergarten children with moderate to severe language impairment who receive direct, explicit, intensive, small group PA intervention demonstrate significantly better PA skills than children with moderate to severe language impairment who do not receive this intervention.

It also places these effects in the context of other school‐based prevention studies and discusses them in view of important methodological and programmatic issues. The incremental effects attributable to the intervention programs were small and sporadic. There were statistically significant increases in prosocial behaviour observed in the playgrounds of intervention schools with no differentiation by program type. Furthermore, there was some evidence—a reduction in teacher and parent‐rated externalising problems—that the combination of SS & RE and SS alone may have had modest beneficial effects. A review of nine other school‐based studies, which evaluated universally delivered mental health prevention programs in general populations of students, revealed similar mixed results. There are both methodologic and programmatic issues implicated in the weak findings that have been reported to date. These issues need to be addressed to advance knowledge about the potential impact of mental‐health prevention initiatives delivered universally through school‐based programs.

37133923,Inglis (2002),2002,"The present investigation focussed on how to enhance self-direction in academic low-achievers. Self-directed students appear different from others by their goal-setting, accurate self-monitoring, and resourcefulness of strategic thinking. These students are generally the classroom high achievers. However, research has shown that even low and average achievers can direct their own learning when given the opportunities to do so. This happens when tasks are not beyond students' skill levels and students must explain or verbalize about the tasks. In the present investigation, fourth-grade low math achievers were trained how to be “math helpers” and assisted younger children with math work over a twelve-week period. In a cross-age setting, academic tasks are usually those that the older child has some experience with and can perform on her own. Through working with the younger child, the older child helps to define and plan the task, monitor progress, and evaluate outcomes. The studies presented here were designed to investigate two outcomes related to participating in the math helpers program  (1) helpers would demonstrate greater improvements in math problem-solving skill compared to same-class controls, and (2) helpers would demonstrate an increased use of Task-Directive Speech (utterances observed while children work on academic activities) post-program compared to same-class controls. Results showed that fourth-grade math helpers demonstrated improvements in mathematics problem-solving post program, as hypothesized. Contrary to expectations, use of Task-Directive Speech did not increase pre- to post-program. A second study was designed to investigate the contribution to problem-solving gains made by helper-training and helping experience. Results revealed that helper training or helping experience alone could not account for improvements in fourth grade math helpers' problem-solving  helpers required training either before or during their helping experiences. This investigation suggests that if we would like to see more students who can and will take responsibility for tasks using learned skills, then each must be provided with some situations in which they are able to make decisions about selecting, planning, monitoring, and evaluating tasks.

In addition, this study identified how exceptional needs learners responded to techniques utilized during differentiated and peer-mediated instruction. The objective of this study was to determine if the interventions produced significant differences in mathematics achievement of exceptional learners and to provide a context in which the selected interventions invoked student behavioral response. The study focused on the following questions  (1) What is the difference in achievement for students receiving differentiated instruction to those receiving peer-mediated instruction?  (2) How does the implementation of differentiated instruction yield differences in achievement across exceptionalities, including learning disabled, mildly intellectually disabled, other health impairment, and emotional and behavioral disorder?  (3) In what ways will the implementation of peer-mediated instruction yield differences in achievement across exceptionalities, including learning disabled, mildly intellectually disabled, other health impairment, and emotional and behavioral disorder?

39253390,Jacob (2004),2004,"As standards and accountability have become increasingly prominent features of the educational landscape, educators have relied more on remedial programs such as summer school and grade retention to help low-achieving students meet minimum academic standards. Yet the evidence on the effectiveness of such programs is mixed, and prior research suffers from selection bias. However, recent school reform efforts in Chicago provide an opportunity to examine the causal impact of these remedial education programs. In 1996, the Chicago Public Schools instituted an accountability policy that tied summer school and promotional decisions to performance on standardized tests, which resulted in a highly nonlinear relationship between current achievement and the probability of attending summer school or being retained. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the net effect of these programs was to substantially increase academic achievement among third-graders, but not sixth-graders.

In the years since its inception, Reading Partners has grown to serve more than 7,000 students in over 130 schools throughout California, Colorado, New York, Oklahoma, Maryland, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington, DC. In March 2011, the program was awarded a three-year investment of up to $3.5 million from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation and the Social Innovation Fund (SIF), matched by $3.5 million in grants from the True North Fund and coinvestors, to further expand its literacy program to elementary schools throughout the country and to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. (Reading Partners has also been expanding with the support of AmeriCorps, a program of the Corporation for National and Community Service. AmeriCorps members provide teaching, mentoring, after-school support, and other services to students in more than 10,000 public schools, including one in three persistently low-achieving schools.) This policy brief summarizes the early results of that evaluation, which was conducted during the 2012-2013 school year in 19 schools in three states, and which involved 1,265 students. The evaluation finds positive impacts of the program on three different measures of reading proficiency. After one year, Reading Partners, a one-on-one tutoring program delivered by volunteers, improved three different measures of reading proficiency for second- to fifth-graders — impacts equaling 1.5 to 2 months of growth in literacy achievement over a control group (who also received supplemental reading services).

40307306,Jeffers (1990),1990,"The purposes of this study are to determine the level of growth by reading improvement students when metacognitive skills are taught and to determine which instructional approach is the most effective in maximizing reading comprehension. The organization of the study includes a statement of the problem, a review of the literature, the methodology used in the statistical analysis of the data, the analysis of data, the findings, conclusions, educational implications, and recommendations for additional research. The instrument used to assess grade gains was the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test Level E, with Form 1 as the pretest and Form 2 as the posttest. These comprehension subtests were given to both the control group and the experimental group. The pretest was used to assess standing at the beginning of the study. The posttest was used to measure growth after the instructional intervention. The control group was taught using the prescribed textbook course of study. In addition to the prescribed textbook course of study, the experimental group was taught six metacognitive strategies--main idea, sequence, cloze procedure, predicting outcomes, inference, and summarizing. Data from the hypothesis were tested with a $t$-test analysis, and the data revealed the following  (1) The gains in comprehension were not significant for either student group. (2) Although the scores between the two groups were not significantly different, the experimental group, who were taught the metacognitive strategies, reflected greater grade-level gains than the control group. From the findings the following suggestions are made  (1) Reading curriculums need to incorporate direct instruction of metacognitive strategies into their overall plan. (2) Evaluation standards need to be formulated to measure students' metacognitive growth. (3) A reading curriculum concentrating on teaching metacognitive strategies needs to be developed with various kinds of guided practice materials being the central focus.

We selected a sample of 83 Spanish children aged between 7 years 1 month and 10 years 6 months (M = 105.2, SD = 7.8) whose pseudoword reading performance was below the 25th percentile and IQ > 90.

Children were pre- and post-tested in word recognition, reading comprehension, phonological awareness, and orthographic and phonological tasks. The results indicate that experimental groups who participated in the phoneme and syllable conditions improved their word recognition in comparison with the control group. In addition, dyslexics who participated in the phoneme, syllable, and onset-rime conditions made a greater number of requests during computer-based word reading under conditions that required extensive phonological computation (low frequency words and long words).

40117137,Johnson (1984),1984,"Research Objectives. This study was undertaken to ascertain whether fifth grade pupils who had participated in year-round school programs will show higher reading and mathematics scores than a similar group of fifth graders who participated only in traditional school programs. Procedure. Twelve year-round and twelve traditional schools from the Los Angeles Unified School District were selected to participate in this casual-comparative (ex post facto) study. The year-round schools selected were those that had been in year-round programs since 1980 and, at the same time could be ""matched"" with traditional schools. Some of the variables considered in ""matching"" the schools were  socio/economic level of the school location, racial/ethnic composition of the school's pupil population, special programs offered to pupils, school size, and type of community surrounding the school. The 1,041 pupils in the study were selected from fifth grade populations of the twenty-four schools. The pupils ranged in age from ten through twelve years. Pupil selection was based on the following criteria  (1) they were in the school in 1979-80 as third graders and continued in the school through the 1981-82 school year as fifth graders  (2) they were fluent in speaking English  and (3) they had complete CTBS scores in reading and mathematics for both 1979-80 and 1981-82 school years. The data on the pupils were collected at school sites and from the Research and Evaluation Branch of the Los Angeles Unified School District. Subprogram ANOVA and subprogram PEARSON CORR of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS system, were used to perform statistical analysis of the data in order to determine statistical significance of the eight null hypotheses of the study. Findings. The following are findings of the study  (1) There was a significant interaction effect on reading between calendar and sex. Year-round school girls scored significantly lower than year-round school boys, and lower than traditional school boys and girls. (2) There was a significant main effect of calendar on mathematics. Pupils in the traditional schools scored significantly higher than pupils in the year-round schools. (3) The relationship between absence and achievement in both reading and mathematics, though low, was significant in most cases and always negative.",['Extending school time'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,Unclear,NA,NA,,"['11', '10']",NA,NA,,12,"['Page 79:\n[¬s]""Twelve of the schools w e r e y ear-round schools[¬e]""']",,,12,"['Page 79:\n[¬s]""other twelve schools w e r e select ed from the District\'s elementary schools on t r adit ion al programs.[¬e]""']",,24,"['Page 79:\n[¬s]""T w e nty-f our e l e m en tar y schools w e r e selected to participate in this study.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, but matched","['Page 18:\n[¬s]""he y e a r -ro und schools selected w e r e those that[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""had been in y e a r - rou nd programs since 1980 and, at the same time could be ""matched"" w i t h tra dit ion al schools.

50307073,Johnson (1997),1997,"Many young adults leave the education system earlier than their capabilities warrant, either dropping out of high school prior to graduation, or graduating but not pursuing a college degree. Impatient with public education's failings in these areas, organizations are increasingly turning to private interventions to address this lost potential. Mentoring programs are one such intervention. The primary theory behind mentoring is that caring and influential adults--related or not--can provide youth with a form of social capital that is invaluable to their development. There are very few controlled empirical studies, however, indicating whether planned mentoring relationships are an effective way to address some of the developmental needs and long-term outcomes of today's youth. This study shows that mentoring can have a significant marginal impact on future academic performance, and that it helps those with greater need. Following a discussion of the history and theory behind mentoring and a review of the available research, findings are presented from an empirical longitudinal evaluation of one mentoring program  The Sponsor-A-Scholar Program in Philadelphia. Data sources used in the evaluation include student surveys, mentor surveys, high school transcripts, school district information on the characteristics of the high schools students attend, program records, and interviews with students, mentors, and school guidance counselors. Formal regression analysis is used. There are several findings from the evaluation  (1) Sponsor-A-Scholar has a positive and significant impact on academic performance in tenth and eleventh grade (but not in twelfth grade), on the extent of student participation in college preparation activities, and on college attendance during the first year after high school. (2) Program participation did not significantly impact students' measured self-esteem. (3) Disadvantaged students were found to benefit more from program participation than were others.

50307059,Jones (1994),1994,"Lack of academic success among Black male students has become a focus of educational debate. Concerned educators have led the search for effective models of intervention and prevention. Current literature indicates that positive interaction with adult male mentors in the educational setting might foster academic success among Black male students. This study investigated the effects of a mentor program on the academic success and self concept of selected Black males in the junior high school. A mentor program was implemented in an Alexandria, Virginia junior high school. Based upon teacher and administrator referral, 50 students who might benefit from participation in a mentor program were identified. Twenty-five students were randomly assigned to the treatment group and participated in the full mentor program. The control group of 25 students was monitored. Eleven city agency and school staff members served as mentors to the experimental group. Treatment and control group students completed Harter's Self Perception Profile for Adolescents. Teachers completed the Teacher Rating of Actual Classroom Behavior which parallels the student profile. Grade point averages (GPA) were also collected for treatment and control group students. The same data was collected in the post-test phase. The data collected from teachers and students were analyzed using the following procedures  paired t-tests and two sample t-tests were performed on academic data  paired t-tests, ANCOVAS, and Pearson's correlations were performed on the self concept data. Data from student questionnaires as well as counselor and mentor interviews were summarized.

Method  This study employed a school-randomized, experimental design and included 942 3rd-grade children (49% boys  45.6% Hispanic/Latino, 41.1% Black/African American, 4.7% non-Hispanic White, and 8.6% other racial/ethnic groups, including Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American) in 18 New York City public elementary schools. Data on children's social–cognitive processes (e.g., hostile attribution biases), behavioral symptomatology (e.g., conduct problems), and literacy skills and academic achievement (e.g., reading achievement) were collected in the fall and spring of 1 school year. Results  There were main effects of the 4Rs Program after 1 year on only 2 of the 13 outcomes examined. These include children's self-reports of hostile attributional biases (Cohen's d = 0.20) and depression ( d = 0.24). As expected based on program and developmental theory, there were impacts of the intervention for those children identified by teachers at baseline with the highest levels of aggression ( d = 0.32–0.59) on 4 other outcomes  children's self-reports of aggressive fantasies, teacher reports of academic skills, reading achievement scaled scores, and children's attendance. Conclusions  This report of effects of the 4Rs intervention on individual children across domains of functioning after 1 school year represents an important first step in establishing a better understanding of what is achievable by a schoolwide intervention such as the 4Rs in its earliest stages of unfolding. The first-year impacts, combined with our knowledge of sustained and expanded effects after a second year, provide evidence that this intervention may be initiating positive developmental cascades both in the general population of students and among those at highest behavioral risk.",['Social and emotional learning'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '8']",NA,NA,,9,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""Figure 1. 4Rs evaluation participant flowchart.

Schools commonly use Tier 2 reading interventions in Response to Intervention (RtI) frameworks to help close the gap between at-risk readers and their peers who read on grade-level. This dissertation presents the findings of a quasi-experimental research study of the effects of three Tier 2 reading interventions in an urban Title I elementary school’s RtI framework. A regression discontinuity design (RDD) with two cutoff points was used to assign 320 students in grades 1-6 to two types of Tier 2 reading interventions administered by paraeducators  direct instruction (DI) and computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Students were assigned using normal curve equivalent reading composite scores on the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement II, Brief Form (KTEA-II BFR). Students scoring below a lower cutoff were assigned to a DI reading intervention, while students scoring at or below an upper cutoff and above the lower cutoff were assigned to CAI reading interventions. January and May posttest iterations of the KTEA-II BFR served as outcome measures for all students. Results of the analysis indicated that the DI intervention was more effective than the CAI interventions at the lower cutoff ( p < .01). Participation in CAI interventions was not any more or less effective than business-as-usual reading activities (p > .10). These findings suggest that CAI programs may not be as helpful in closing the achievement gap between struggling students and their peers as DI interventions, and should be implemented with deliberation.

To determine what factors contributed to successful outcomes in individual dyads, tutoring sessions over a school year were tape‐recorded and videotaped. Tapes were analyzed into type of verbal interactions (i.e., scaffolded or modeled processes) and time spent engaged in seven tutoring activities (e.g., reading literature, writing, letter‐sound instruction). Multiple measures of reading, writing, and attitude towards school were administered at the beginning and end of the school year both to the children and to the older poor reader tutors (who also engaged in additional reading and writing activities outside of tutoring), and to control groups. Both tutors and children made significantly greater literacy growth than their respective control groups. Two activities were found to be particularly important in successful dyads  (a) the use of texts that gradually and repetitively introduced both high‐frequency vocabulary and words with common spelling patterns, and (b) activities in which children were engaged in direct letter‐sound instruction.

37116222,Karagiannakis (2008),2008,"Boys with behaviour problems (BP) exhibit a variety of difficulties in academic and socio-behavioural-emotional domains. Interventions offered at the early elementary years can significantly decrease difficulties that can occur later in life. Without early interventions, behaviour difficulties can persist into adolescence and adulthood. In addition to the difficulties experienced in the academic and socio-behavioural-emotional domains, boys with BP tend to endorse negative self-perceptions and based on the scarce literature, they also tend to have a low social status, as perceived by their peers. As the profile for boys with BP is well established and tends to be stable, effective interventions that encompass academic and behavioural components must be implemented in the school environment, in which boys spend a great portion of their day. The present study focussed on investigating the effects of a well-researched programme, Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT), on the academic, behavioural, on-task, self-concept and social status of 40 boys with BP following 12 weeks of participation in the programme. A control group of 33 boys with and without BP who did not participate in CWPT was also investigated on the same variables. Results are particularly encouraging, as significant findings were obtained on many of the measures for all boys who participated in CWPT. Furthermore, in addition to the impressive academic improvements, important gains were observed on the social status and domain-specific perceptions of boys with BP. Implications regarding implementation of CWPT with additional populations of children with diverse needs will be discussed as it relates to the inclusive movement.

Such problems are increasingly viewed as products of students’ disconnectedness from school, teachers, peers, and parents. One response to this crisis of disconnection is to develop programs that promote youths’ sense of belonging and keep them connected during periods of transition. This article reports a oneyear longitudinal study of developmental mentoring, a school-based intervention that enlists high school students as mentors to elementary school students. The findings from this study suggest that the developmental mentoring program promoted conventional connectedness to parents, school, and the future, and that program effects on spelling achievement scores were mediated by maintenance of parental connectedness into middle school.

One approach is that of placing a small number of underachieving gifted children in homogeneous classes with gifted children who are achieving at a level commensurate with their abilities.

37092606,King (2003),2003,"Goals 2000 set forth a bold vision for U.S. students  they would be ""first in the world in science and mathematics"" by the year 2000. Performance indicators such as the TIMSS-R (1999) and NAEP (2000) reports suggest that U.S. students have not yet reached that goal. This study intended to learn how specific assessment strategies might contribute to improved student performance in science. This quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of formative assessment with reflection on students' motivational beliefs, self-regulatory skills, and achievement in elementary science. The study aimed to find out whether and how classroom applications of formative assessment during science instruction might influence fifth-grade students' attitudes and self-perceptions about science learning, self-regulatory learning behaviors, and achievement. To explore the effects of the assessment intervention, the study utilized a mixed methods approach involving quantitative and qualitative investigations of treatment and control groups during a four-week intervention period. Quantitative measures included student selfreport surveys administered pre- and post-treatment and an end-of-unit science test. Qualitative measures included classroom observations, student interviews (posttreatment), and a teacher interview (post-treatment). Findings indicated that the fifth-grade students in this study had positive attitudes toward science and high levels of self-efficacy for science. Results suggested that these elementary students employed a wide variety of cognitive and metacognitive strategies to support science learning. Findings revealed that these fifth graders believed formative assessment with reflection was beneficial for science learning outcomes. Research results did not show that the formative assessment intervention contributed to significant differences between treatment and control groups. However, the data revealed different levels of academic achievement and self-regulation for students in specific instructional services subgroups (i.e.. gifted, regular education, special education, and ESL). For example, high achieving students reported higher levels of self-regulatory learning behavior than other fifth grade students. Findings suggested that elementary science instruction that includes classroom applications of formative assessment with reflection may provide support for science learning and the development of self-regulatory learning behavior. However, widespread implementation of this practice in elementary science classrooms represents significant challenges for today’s educators, due to time limitations and increasing accountability pressures in our nation's schools.",['Feedback'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '11']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 73:\n[¬s]""an elementary school[¬e]""']",,,1,"['Page 73:\n[¬s]""an elementary school[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 73:\n[¬s]"" an elementary school[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,2,"['Page 73:\n[¬s]"" two treatment classes received the intervention[¬e]""']",,1,,"['Page 73:\n[¬s]""one class, the control group, had no intervention[¬e]""']",3,"['Page 73:\n[¬s]""three fifth-grade classes[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, not matched prior to treatment","['Page 74:\n[¬s]""The research study was a quasi-experimental design with pre-test/post-test and control group, combining quantitative and qualitative research methods and outcome measures.[¬e]""']",NA,,Class,"['Page 82:\n[¬s]""Student participants in the study included three fifth-grade classes, with one control (n =22) and two treatment classes (n = 43).[¬e]""']",NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 108:\n[¬s]""Regarding randomness, all fifth graders at this school participated in the study, so sampling was not random.

Participants in the experimental group made significantly greater gains in reading and spelling accuracy than those in the control group on both experimental and standardized measures of reading and spelling.

One of the major responses to these needs has been the consideration of a change in the school calendar from the traditional nine month calendar to a year round calendar in order to provide education to the ever increasing student population and as a strategy for improving the achievement of students that are considered at-risk. Using an ex-post facto, posttest control group design with matching, this study investigates the impact of the year round calendar on achievement, and the degree to which it differentially affects at-risk students. In addition, the study examines achievement impact in relation to the SES level of the school and the length of implementation of the YRE program . Fourth, fifth, and sixth grade traditional calendar and year round students were matched on their standard reading and math subtest percentile scores of the 1992 Norm-referenced Assessment Program for Texas (NAPT). T-tests for related samples were calculated using the Bonferroni method on mean achievement scores of the 1993 NAPT to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Results of the data analyses indicated statistically significant differences in math and reading achievement for all students, and especially in reading for at-risk students. Statistical significance in favor of YRE was also found in both reading and math for low SES schools. Differences in achievement with respect to number of years of individual school implementation of YRE yielded results of statistical significance in five out of six comparisons. In order to determine practical significance effect size was calculated. The year round school structure yielded practically significant results in 23 out o f 26 data analysis comparisons, with effect sizes ranging from .21 to .88. In summary, the results from this study reveal that mean scores and effect sizes favored the year round calendar in all comparisons.

The summer school program consisted of half day sessions held for 24 days during the months of June and July. The relationship between summer school attendance and achievement in reading and mathematics by grade level, gender and ethnic group was examined. The population of the study consisted of 263 second grade students and 368 fifth grade students who had test scores recorded for both the spring and fall administration of the California Achievement Test. The experimental group consisted of students who failed their benchmark tests in either reading or mathematics and attended the 1988 summer school. The control group consisted of students who failed their benchmark tests in either reading or mathematics but elected not to attend summer school. The results of the study indicated that summer school students in both grades two and five made significant gains in reading achievement scores over the summer. Much of the gain appeared to be attributed to attendance in summer school. Grade five mathematics summer school students while not making significant gains in mathematics computation skills showed significantly less regression in their mathematics skills over the summer than did the non summer school group. The only summer school group that did not show some significant benefit from summer school was the grade two mathematics group. The data indicated a significant regression in mathematics computation skills over the summer for this group. It should be pointed out, that the grade two non summer school group also showed some regression in their mathematics skills over the summer.

37092607,"Koedinger, McLaughlin & Heffernan (2010)",2010,"ASSISTments is a web-based math tutor designed to address the need for timely student assessment while simultaneously providing instruction, thereby avoiding lost instruction time that typically occurs during assessment. This article presents a quasi-experiment that evaluates whether ASSISTments use has an effect on improving middle school students' year-end test scores. The data was collected from 1240 seventh graders in three treatment schools and one comparison school. Post-test (7th grade year-end test) results indicate, after adjusting for the pre-test (6th grade year-end test), that students in the treatment schools significantly outperformed students in the comparison school and the difference was especially present for special education students. A usage analysis reveals that greater student use of ASSISTments is associated with greater learning consistent with the hypothesis that it is useful as a tutoring system. We also found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that teachers adapt their whole class instruction based on overall student performance in ASSISTments. Namely, increased teacher use (i.e., having more students use the system more often) is associated with greater learning among students with little or no use, suggesting that those students may have benefited from teachers adapting their whole-class instruction based on what they learned from ASSISTments use reports.

Specifically, the study determined if there was a difference in teacher grades and achievement test scores of students in the subjects of language arts, mathematics, and reading as well as the number of days of student absence between the school districts and within each school district by gender. The population was from two school districts located in suburban areas of Chicago, Illinois. Each group was composed of 90 male and 90 female students randomly selected from students who attended school in the same district from third grade through seventh grade in regular education classes to form a total sample of 360 students. An experimental design, the pretest-posttest control group design, was chosen because equivalent groups were achieved by randomization with the measure of significant differences tested in 7th grade using 3rd grade as the covariates. A two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was computed for each hypothesis to determine whether there was a significant difference between groups and within group by gender. The findings indicated that year round school students probably earned higher teacher grades in language arts than traditional school year students. By contrast, traditional school year students probably scored higher on language arts and reading achievement tests. Only in reading achievement scores was there a significant difference in the interaction of school and gender. Within the traditional school year group females scored higher than males, but within the year round school group females scored lower than males. There was no significant difference between groups for teacher grades and achievement test scores in mathematics. One finding was repeated for each hypothesis, there was no significant difference within each school district group by gender.

The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of the Lindamood, Orton-Gillingham Log Program on the reading and spelling skills of older reading disabled students. The LOG Program is a multi-sensory program designed to develop a foundation in phonemic analysis skills basic to reading acquisition.  Two groups of 20 students were studied  one group received instruction based on the LOG Program while the control group received their normal remedial reading instruction for a period of three months. The control and experimental groups were intact groups  students were matched in pairs on sex, age, I.Q., and reading ability. Pre and posttesting included a measurement of reading and spelling achievement (Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement).  MANCOVA and ANCOVA were applied to determine if the LOG Program made a statistically significant difference in the reading and spelling skills of the reading delayed children in the treatment group when pretest scores were controlled. The analysis suggested that the LOG Program was effective for improving the overall reading and spelling skills of the students in the treatment group as measured by the K-TEA. Further analysis revealed the techniques of the LOG Program were effective for improving the reading decoding and spelling skills, but not the reading comprehension skills of the treatment group.  The results of this study support the literature on the effectiveness of phonemic awareness training on the acquisition of reading skills. The findings also suggest the LOG Program is an effective method for teaching reading decoding and spelling skills to the older reading delayed students in this study.

37093356,Lamport (1982),1982,"Scope of Study. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an eight-week inverse tutoring program was effective as an alternative instructional strategy for reading disabled elementary-aged students in a public school setting. Inverse tutoring is the process in which a student with learning difficulties serves as a tutor to another student with learning difficulties. This investigation evaluated the effects of inverse tutoring on auditory vocabulary, phonetic analysis skills, reading comprehension, classroom disturbance behaviors, withdrawn-inattentive behaviors, and reactions toward school. Forty-eight reading disabled students were included in the investigation. The 24 students who participated in the experimental and control groups of tutors attended a sixth grade center, and the other 24 students in the experimental and control groups of tutees were enrolled in an elementary school located nearby. Tutors attended two training sessions and three tutoring sessions each week, and students in the tutor control group attended remedial reading class during the eight-week period. Tutees participated in three 30 minute tutoring sessions each week, and their control group attended their regularly scheduled remedial reading and/or learning disabilities class. Findings and Conclusions. The design of this study was pretest-treatment-posttest, and the analysis of covariance was utilized to analyze the data. The results indicated that the tutors achieved significantly higher scores in phonetic analysis skills and more positive reactions toward school than the students in their control group. Analysis of the data also revealed that the tutees earned significantly higher scores in auditory vocabulary and more positive reactions to school than students in their control group. There were no significant differences between experimental and control groups of tutors and tutees in the other areas evaluated. The results indicated that participation as a tutor in an inverse tutoring program produces gains equivalent to those received from participation in a remedial reading program.",['Peer tutoring'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,"['Primary/elementary school', 'Other educational setting (please specify)']",NA,sixth grade school,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8', '9', '11', '12']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]"" a nearby school composed of only sixth grade students[¬e]""']",,,1,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""an elementary school containing kindergarten through fifth grade[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""two[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],Unclear,,NA,,['No'],"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""Twelve elementary students enrolled in learning disabilities lab for reading and/or in remedial reading classes were assigned to the tutee treatment group and 12 other students attending learning disabil\xad ities lab for reading and/or remedial reading classes were included in the tutee control group.""\n""The 12 students in the sixth grade treatment group served as tutors, and the 12 students in the elementary level treatment group served as tutees.[¬e]""', 'Page 34:\n[¬s]""1.

Similarly, the presence of an instructional assistant predicted better achievement in reading, language, and the composite score only in higher SES schools. Analysis of race and class size showed that black students had better achievement in smaller classes, while white students did better in larger classes. HLM analyses of the student-teacher ratio showed pervasive SES and race effects.

40117206,Lauver (2002),2002,"After-school programs have gained national attention as a means to provide additional academic, social, and recreational opportunities for youth. Poor, inner-city communities are especially in need of these programs because urban youth often lack the safe parks, sports teams, clubs, and other enriching opportunities that are typically offered in middle-income and affluent communities. For these reasons, public support is especially strong for urban after-school programs. The primary research question for this dissertation is whether an after-school program administered by an urban public middle school, with limited funding support and technical assistance, can make meaningful improvements in academic and social outcomes for young adolescents (ages 10-14) living in poverty-impacted neighborhoods. The project is an impact evaluation and process analysis of an urban middle school after-school recreation program. It is hypothesized that the after-school program will increase students' time spent in positive extracurricular activities and increase their academic grades and test scores. It will also reduce their time spent in self-care and watching television. The study sample includes 227 students who applied to the after-school program and were subsequently randomly assigned to the program or to a control group. The findings from the process evaluation suggest that the relationships between staff and students involved in the after-school program were overwhelmingly positive, and the students and their parents were satisfied with the program. The main challenges observed were the students' lower than expected utilization of the program, the staff's irregular attendance during the first year of the evaluation, and the difficulties in ensuring facility space and dedicated storage for program supplies. The findings from the impact study demonstrate that the program had a significant and positive effect on program participants' time spent doing homework and on their educational aspirations. It also resulted in youths' spending significantly more time participating in strength training exercises at a fitness center than would have been the case otherwise. There were no measurable benefits of the after-school program on other extracurricular activities  academic grades or standardized test scores  in-school behavior or attendance  or on time spent watching television or in self-care.",['Extending school time'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15']",NA,NA,,1,NA,,,1,NA,,1,"['Page 78:\n[¬s]""A critical feature of Cooke\nMiddle School’s after-school recreation program was that it could serve only about 125\nof its 950 day-school students.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,"['Page 79:\n[¬s]""The Study Sample\nThe study sample is comprised of 227 total program applicants.

Participants were exposed to eight weeks of instruction in mathematics, using the three instructional strategies and a control group. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyze the three hypotheses generated at 0.05 level of significance, with the results showing a significant effect on participants’ achievement scores in mathematics (F (2,143) = 32.497  P < 0.05). This implies that there is a significant difference in mathematics achievement of participants exposed to peer tutoring, cooperative learning, and the control group. Further analysis revealed that students exposed to cooperative learning instructional strategy performed better than students exposed to peer tutoring and the control.

The pretest was administered at the end of third grade as a benchmark and to determine homogeneity of variance.

The results indicated that Chapter I males attending summer school assumed the profile of non-Chapter I males during both posttests in reading and math. Chapter I males who attended summer school and the non-Chapter I males regressed from the gains of the first posttest in reading achievement while the Chapter I males who did not attend summer school showed progress. Chapter I females who attended summer school showed significant differences in mean gains for math when compared to both of the female groups on the two posttests, overcoming a significant difference in Homogeneity, and assuming a profile of non-Chapter I students. Large standard deviations appeared to effect the significance of the mean gains in reading on both posttests. The lack of continuing advancement for Chapter I students who attended summer school and non-Chapter I students is unexplained in this study.

Two types of data were statistically analyzed. First, the subject's performance was compared against itself to determine if performance is affected by amount of participation in the program. Secondly, the subject's performance was compared to a comparison group to determine if student performance was affected by participation in the ASPP. The data set for the experimental and control groups was analyzed by means of a general linear model analysis of variance. The data set for effect of amount of participation in the program was analyzed by means of a correlated t-test. The dependent variables were the Metropolitan Achievement Test scores, final mathematics and reading grades, and average daily attendance. The independent variables were participation in the program and amount of participation in the program. The study found significant differences in the names of the experimental and control group in final reading grades in the first grade in Hypothesis 4. Since there were no significant differences in the final mathematics grades, the researcher suggested that while the emphasis on reading instruction and verbal skills in the first grade might have contributed to the treatment group reading gain, factors within the ASPP must be considered also. The program emphasis was on verbal skills rather than computational skills. In addition the tutorial component of the program could have contributed to gains in the final reading grades. The results of this study suggest that the measures used to study the program's effectiveness may have been inappropriate, it is possible that the value of after-school programs for young children lies in areas other than academic achievement. The learning of school participation skills, the development of positive attitudes toward school, and the importance of parental involvement in their children's schooling were discussed as potentially important areas of study.

46888303,Lenhard (2013),2013,"There are many established reading strategy training programmes, which explicitly teach strategic and meta-cognitive knowledge to improve reading comprehension. Although instruction in strategy knowledge leads to improvements in meta-cognitive skills, the effects do not always transfer to reading comprehension. Therefore, to investigate preconditions for knowledge transfer, two different strategy training programmes were implemented in nine classes of Grade 6 students (N = 148) over the course of one school year. One programme involved teacher-directed instruction of declarative meta-cognitive knowledge (Reading Detectives  Ruhl & Souvignier, 2006). The other aimed at improving executive meta-cognition by guided practice  students worked with a computer program based on latent semantic analysis (LSA) (conText) and received immediate feedback on written summaries. Although both groups improved their strategy knowledge to the same extent, the conText group showed a greater improvement in reading comprehension. These findings suggest that guided practice, which is characterised by intensive practice and individualised corrective feedback, is superior to explicitly teaching strategy knowledge.

The method used to conduct the study was an after-school tutorial program that provided students with homework assistance and tutoring in reading and mathematics. The study included 39 middle grade students who reported for tutoring two days per week (Tuesdays and Thursdays) from 3 30 p.m. to 5 00 p.m. Results of the program revealed a significant difference in the mean gain score in reading and reduction in failures of the target group as compared to a comparable group who did not attend the after-school tutorial program. However, there was no significant difference in the mean gain score in mathematics and the mean difference in discipline referral rates for the target group as compared to a comparable group who did not attend the after-school tutorial program.

47269830,Lesnick (2006) 1 1,2006,"This dissertation describes the methods and findings of a mixed-methods multi-level randomized evaluation study of the impact of the New Heights Reading Program on the fluency and comprehension of struggling readers. The impact analysis is a randomized complete block experiment (Meter, Kutner, Nachtsheim, & Wasserman, 1996) that uses a combination of individual and group randomization (Boruch, May, Lavenberg, et al., 2004  Raudenbush, 1997). A complementary process evaluation provides context for the quantitative outcomes, helping to explain the varying degrees of implementation of the program and the corresponding outcomes for participating students (Scheirer, 1994). Originally developed in New Zealand under the name Rainbow Reading, this is the first evaluation of the American version of the curriculum. The study sample consists of 233 students in 30 third grade classrooms and 29 fifth grade classrooms in nine schools across two school districts. All students reading nine or more moths below grade level in the participating classrooms were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups with a maximum of six students assigned to the treatment group per class. Students completed three pre- and post-test standardized measures of fluency and comprehension. Program providers participated in pre- and post-intervention teacher interviews, completed implementation surveys, and allowed the researcher to observe an average of eight sessions each during the eighteen weeks of intervention. Data from the process evaluation revealed that although the majority of teachers implemented the program with high quality, the quantity with which they used the program was quite low, as was their overall fidelity of implementation to the intended design. A rubric was developed to categorize the implementation practices of teachers across five dimensions  quality of practice, frequency of practice, quality of teacher conferences, frequency of teacher conferences, and goodness of fit. The impact evaluation found no significant impacts of the program on student fluency, comprehension, or attitudes as measured by the adjusted post-test differences between treatment and control groups. Furthermore, there were no detectable differences in impact of the New Heights Reading Program across the implementation levels of providers. The paper concludes with implications for policy and future research.",['One to one tuition'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['8', '9', '10', '11']",NA,NA,,9,NA,,,9,NA,,9,NA,,NA,NA,NA,59,NA,,59,,NA,59,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),NA,NA,,Not provided/ not available,NA,NA,,['Multisite RCT'],NA,NA,,Yes,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""All students reading\nnine or more moths below grade level in the participating classrooms were randomly\nassigned to the treatment or control groups with a maximum of six students assigned to\nthe treatment group per class.[¬e]""', 'Page 59:\n[¬s]""Table 3.4 presents the number of students in the treatment and control groups for\neach of the twenty-three blocks used for random assignment.

40307321,Li (1996),1996,"The case method has been widely used in preparation programs in training business people, lawyers, and doctors, but it has rarely been used with younger students. This study was designed to examine (1) whether fifth grade students were mature enough to handle the case method, and (2) whether the case method was effective in improving fifth grade students' reading comprehension. My hypothesis was that fifth grade students were not only able to handle the case method, but also that the case method would be as effective in improving students' academic work as it had been with adults. 62 fifth grade students from three classes were assigned to one of three treatment groups--the case method group, the strategy group, or the control group (which was controlled for the instructional method used). The study lasted eight weeks with the first and the last week allocated to testing. Three hours of instruction occurred each week. Students were monitored for their reading comprehension by six weekly comprehension quizzes and pre- and post-study comprehension tests. Students were also monitored for their reading strategy awareness, their attitudes toward reading, and their attribution of success or failure in reading. Findings from this study demonstrate that (1) students as young as fifth graders could learn to use the case method, and (2) the case method was more effective than the strategy method in improving students' reading comprehension. The students in the case method group exhibited stronger performance on the six comprehension quizzes and suffered the least loss among the three groups when external conditions were disruptive. The findings also support the knowledge that reading strategies can be taught to students using direct and explicit instructional methods.

The two groups did not differ significantly on gender, parent education level, or ethnicity. Some positive effects of Duke TIP summer programs were found on later academic achievement and educational choices using both standardized objective measures and self-reports of high school and college academic experiences. We found that students who participated in a Duke TIP math program in middle school did indeed take more AP math courses in high school, but there were no effects for other types of advanced math classes or for any other subjects. Additionally, compared to Search Only students, students who took a math/science course at Duke TIP were more likely to major in math/science in college. More Duke TIP students than Search Only students aspired to earn a doctorate. Anecdotally, we also have heard from many former Duke TIP participants how much Duke TIP has affected their lives, and it is noteworthy that we are now able to empirically document some of these effects.

We compared automatic feedback that included information about the right answer with feedback that also included the connection between the students' strategic search decisions and their performance. Ninety-two high school students read two non-continuous texts. They received feedback during a training phase, and then they read and also received feedback with a similar text in a final phase. Text and questions were presented using a new computer-based technology that provided automatic adaptive feedback depending on the experimental condition  right-answer feedback, strategic-search-decisions feedback and placebo feedback. We found that strategic-search-decisions feedback improved strategic decisions over right-answer and placebo feedback in the final text, which in turn improved question-answering performance.

This is achieved by pupils working together to follow the Paired Reading steps to choose the material to read, and discuss this, together with the older pupil (tutor) supporting the reading, correcting errors and praising the younger pupil (tutee) throughout. The 16-week programme is intended to take place during normal school hours in timetabled sessions, for 20 minutes each week. Teachers in participating schools received training from the delivery team, a detailed programme manual and extensive digital resources.

The adult community volunteers were involved in working twice a week for about 30 minutes on an individual basis with junior school children. The study is in two parts. Part One is a pre‐post experimental study investigating the effectiveness of VRH in improving children's reading and Self‐concept. The children were allocated randomly to either VRH (N‐43) or control‐group (N=38). The findings show no significant VRH‐effect. Part Two is an investigation of VRH as it is provided in practice. The analysis of tape‐recorded sessions (of 15 different Volunteer Reading Helpers) shows many discrepancies between the recommended VRH approach and the actual approach taken in practice, in particular with respect to reading for meaning and talking with children.

Originally it had been intended that pupils would only receive one to one support, and that all coaches would be graduates. However, in practice pupils received a range of targeted support that varied between schools and most, but not all, coaches were graduates. The programme built on a successful pilot in Perry Beeches Academy in Birmingham, and the school co-ordinated the project across participating schools.

It also examined the mentoring program's effect on at-risk students' attitudes about school and the program's effect on the incidence of behavior referrals and absences. The target population for this study was at-risk students in grades two through five. A stratified sample of sixty-six students was randomly selected, proportionately representing elementary at-risk students in sex, race, and grade level. Random assignment was used to place these sixty-six students in three groups  seventeen in a mentoring group, sixteen in a tutoring group and thirty-three in a control group. Thirty-three teachers volunteered to be mentors and tutors. The mentors and tutors were trained on specific skills and procedures for mentoring or tutoring identified in the literature as essential for these purposes. One to one teacher-student mentoring or tutoring sessions occurred weekly on a half hour basis over a seven month period. Standardization of the mentoring and tutoring process was enhanced by audio taping all sessions. Each taped session was rated by independent co-raters for inclusion of essential behaviors needed to be an effective mentor or tutor. In addition, four hours of training, weekly logs, on-site observations and monthly sharing sessions supported the consistent delivery of treatment. A pretest-posttest experimental design was followed to collect reading and math achievement data and also attitudes about school. Frequencies of absences and behavior referrals were analyzed using ANOVA. The results of this study revealed that the mentoring program did not have a statistically significant effect on the dependent variables investigated.

The second program was patterned after the Palinesar and Brown (1984 reciprocal teaching techniques and focused on training four text comprehension strategies used by skilled comprehenders. Both the 'knowledge-base' and the 'strategy' training approaches were associated with significant improvement in disabled readers' comprehension skills, although training effects did not generalize across all aspects of reading comprehension performance. Strategy-trained readers applied the trained strategies with equal success on instructed text materials, providing strong evidence of transfer of learning.

Trained students were instructed to make predictions when reading, to generate questions about text, to summarize what was read, and to clarify points that were hard to understand. The strategies were taught using the reciprocal instruction approach developed by Palincsar and Brown (1984), involving provision of support to students as they needed it and peer teaching of strategies. Control subjects were exposed to the same materials as reciprocally trained students but were given no strategy instruction. The most important finding was a greater increase from before to after training on a standardized test of reading comprehension in the reciprocally trained than in the control condition. This effect is important since standardized comprehension tests measure important reading skills and are used extensively in making curriculum and instruction decisions.

Specifically it evaluates a reading intervention programme devised by educational psychologists and delivered by teaching assistants specially trained by a psychologist. The article assesses the extent to which a psychologist, working through school personnel, added value to the education process within participating schools, the nature of that value and the challenges that had to be overcome. Results showed significant group level improvements in word recognition abilities amongst readers with delayed reading, although the extent of these improvements varied according to school and age with older pupils benefiting more than younger ones. Girls gained more than boys, but this difference was not statistically significant. It was also demonstrated that the programme could be delivered to schools on a low budget including the training of school personnel and taught effectively by non-professional teachers with minimum disruption. It was concluded that the service-delivery approach taken was in keeping with the new expectations of professional educational psychologists and as such provides a useful model for others operating in a changing service context.

43099974,Marion (2004),2004,"The purpose of this study was to compare the academic achievement of students through the use of standardized testing to examine the relationship of participation in a computer-based phonics instructional system called Fast ForWord®. The sample included students enrolled in the fifth and sixth grades at four elementary schools in the Grainger County, Tennessee, school system. The comparison group consisted of same-grade peers at the four elementary schools in Grainger County who were not enrolled in the Fast ForWord® program. Students' scores were compared using the 2003 Terra Nova standardized assessment test and using their 2001 and 2002 test scores as a control. Comparisons were made using the reading, language, math, science, and social studies subsections of the Terra Nova. Differences between students who received Fast ForWord® and students who did not receive Fast ForWord® were analyzed. The study examined the variables of gender, school enrollment, socioeconomic status, time of intervention, and ability grouping. These variables were examined with analysis of covariance to determine differences. When differences did exist between groups, posthoc tests were used to determine specific differences between groups. The findings indicated that there were measurable differences in the performance of students who received Fast ForWord® compared to students who did not receive Fast ForWord®. Significant differences were found in reading and language subsections of the Terra Nova test for students who had participated in the Fast ForWord® reading program. The findings from the examination of other variables indicated that gender as well as gender x the intervention (Fast ForWord®) interaction were the same for females and males in their performance on the Terra Nova. The findings from the variable socioeconomic status were determined using system data for free/reduced or paid meals. The study determined that socioeconomic status did not significantly affect scores of students including the socioeconomic status x the intervention interaction. The study did determine differences in students' performance among schools attended. The study found some differences for intervention administration times and among ability groups.

The goal of MRC is to ensure that students become successful readers and meet reading proficiency targets by the end of the third grade. To meet this goal, the MRC program, and its host organization, ServeMinnesota Action Network, recruit, train, place and monitor AmeriCorps members to implement research-based literacy enrichment activities and interventions for at-risk Kindergarten through third grade (K-3) students and preschool children. Starting in 2011, the ""Corporation for National and Community Service"" (CNCS) sponsored a randomized controlled trial (RCT) impact evaluation of over 1,300 K-3 students at 23 participating schools who were determined to be eligible for the MRC program during the 2012-2013 school year. The goal of the impact evaluation was to determine both the short- and long-term impacts of the MRC program on elementary students' literacy outcomes. Key findings from the evaluation include  (1) Kindergarten, first, and third grade students who received MRC tutoring achieved significantly higher literacy assessment scores than students who did not  (2) MRC tutoring resulted in statistically significant impacts across multiple racial groups.

These averages mask considerable heterogeneity, however, with effect size estimates ranging from just below zero to one-quarter of a standard deviation.

Also investigated was the comparison of student attitudes as was manifest in the 45-15 and standard calendar schools. For the purpose of this study a quasi-experimental pretest and posttest design was selected. For the cognitive area the independent variable was calendar (45-15 and standard). Classification variables were sex and ethnic membership. The dependent variable, achievement in first year algebra, was divided into  (1) algebra achievement as measured by the standardized' test, Cooperative Mathematics Test, Form A, and (2) algebra achievement as measured by a teacher-constructed multiple choice test. For the affective domain the independent variable was calendar and the dependent variable was attitude. The attitude instrument used was the Semantic Distance Questionnaire. The student sample consisted of 144 ninth grade students (72 in a 45-15 calendar and 72 in a standard calendar school—36 ix X students in' each group were Spanish surnamed and 36 in each group were designated as ""other"").

The programme was delivered by Unitas, a national charity that helps young people access, participate, and progress in mainstream education and training. Participating students received 20-minute one to one sessions with a volunteer coach each weekday for five weeks at the end of primary school and for a further 10 weeks at the start of secondary school. Children were expected to read independently for a further 20 minutes per day, and were rewarded for attendance with credits that could be used to buy books online. The trial examined the impact of the programme on 501 pupils in 96 schools across England who had been identified as unlikely to achieve Level 4a or above by the end of Key Stage 2. Pupils who were not likely to gain at least Level 2 were not included in the trial.

The programme was delivered by Booktrust, an independent charity that aims to change lives through engaging people with reading. Participating pupils were gifted four book packs and invited to attend two summer events led by Booktrust staff at their new secondary school. The first book pack was gifted towards the end of the child’s final term at primary school, the second and third packs at the summer events and the final pack in the first term of secondary school. Volunteers, recruited by Booktrust, gifted the book packs and supported activities, including one to one reading, at the summer events. The trial examined the impact of the programme on 205 pupils from 10 schools in the north of England who had been identified as unlikely to achieve Level 4a or above by the end of Key Stage 2.

Sixty first graders from three north Louisiana public elementary schools with high poverty rates, who were determined by their teachers and principals to be functioning in the bottom 20 to 30% of first grade reading students, were purposefully selected. Students were pretested on three subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test-Revised (WRMT-R), Form G  Letter Identification, Word Identification, and Word Attack. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group. Experimental group students received 15 minutes per day of tutoring by America Reads Volunteers in the Edmark Reading Program, a highly structured sight word program. In order to partially control for the Hawthorne Effect, control group students were read aloud to for 15 minutes each day by the same volunteers. At the completion of the first semester of the school year, the 60 participants were tested on four subtests of the WRMT-R, Form H (Letter Identification, Word Identification, Word Attack, Passage Comprehension) and were asked to read aloud the 150 words taught in the treatment program. Qualitative data were also collected in the form of student, parent, teacher, and administrator interviews, observation, and examination of documents. Quantitative data were analyzed with four ANCOVAs and one ANOVA using the General Linear Model  stepwise multiple regression was used to determine covariates for each subtest. Qualitative data were examined using content analysis. Results indicated a significant difference in the performance of experimental group students on the WRMT-R Passage Comprehension subtest and Edmark posttest  there were no significant differences between experimental and control group means on the WRMT-R Letter Identification, Word Identification, and Word Attack subtests. Qualitative data indicated that more experimental group students than control group students exhibited significantly improved reading ability, attitudes toward reading, attitudes toward school, and attitudes toward self.

The results were consistent from Year 1 to Year 2. No differences were seen on one measure of lesson-text comprehension, the sentence verification technique. However, for narrative recall and expository learning probes, content students outperformed strategies students, and occasionally, the basal control students outperformed strategies students. For one of the transfer assessments, there was a modest effect in favor of the content students.

Four 15-minute sessions per week are delivered by a teaching assistant (TA) to groups of three to five pupils. This report summarizes the findings of a randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of ABRA on literacy outcomes for Year 1 pupils. The trial also assesses the impact of an offline, paper and pencil version of the same intervention (referred to here at ""the non-Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) intervention""). There were 51 participating schools and 2,241 pupils at randomization, and a total of 48 schools and 1,884 pupils were included in the final analysis (84% of the initial pupils at randomization). The trial took place between October 2014 and May 2015. Fifty-one schools were randomly assigned to either receive some version of the intervention or to act as a ""control"" school delivering business as usual. In the schools receiving the intervention, pupils were randomized to receive one of the following options  (1) ABRA, (2) the non-ICT intervention, and (3) standard literacy provision. The process evaluation involved observing sessions to understand a variety of factors in the intervention. These included an evaluation of which elements contributed to successful implementation, the perceptions and experiences of TAs and project leads, levels of pupil engagement, and the mechanisms behind the estimated impacts. This was an efficacy study, due to the involvement of the developer in the delivery of the program. Key conclusions of this report are  (1) The children who received ABRA, or its offline alternative were found to make two and three months' progress in literacy respectively compared to the children who received standard provision. This positive result would be unlikely to occur by chance  (2) For both ABRA and the offline alternative, the impact for children eligible for free school meals and children with below average pre-test outcomes was larger than for all pupils  (3) Successful implementation contributed to a well-designed and delivered training program which emphasized fidelity and consistency, enforced by ongoing support from the project team  (4) The process evaluation found that both the ICT and non-ICT interventions may be best delivered in groups of similar rather than mixed ability. The process evaluation also suggested minor changes to the intervention to make it more culturally relevant to British pupils, and to remove some repetition in the non-ICT program  and (5) Future research will examine whether ABRA or the non-ICT intervention can be successfully delivered at scale, and will look at longer-term impacts through assessing Key Stage 1 data from this trial.

Middle school students were randomly assigned to a school‐based mentoring program (n =60) or a control group (n =60) during the first semester of middle school. Results suggest that random assignment to the mentoring program designed to ease the transition to middle school was associated with statistically significant decreases in reading grades and null effects on other measures, including school and teacher connectedness. These results reinforce the need to evaluate mentoring programs on a case‐by‐case basis and continue to innovate in the area of school‐based mentoring until robust, replicable evidence‐based procedures are identified. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",['Mentoring'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""Students that returned consent were randomly assigned to transitional\nmentoring or a waitlist control group.[¬e]""']",NA,,Individual,NA,NA,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""Middle school students were randomly assigned\nto a school-based mentoring program (n560) or a control group\n(n560) during the ﬁrst semester of middle school.[¬e]""']",NA,,No/Unclear,NA,Details of randomisation were not provided.,,NA,NA,NA,,['Other types of student outcomes (Please specify)'],NA,"behaviour, self report feelings of connectedness and teacher connectedness",,NA,NA,
50307065,McQuillin (2012),2012,"Although youth mentoring is popular in the United States, and beginning to gain popularity in other countries, dissemination efforts have preceded the establishment of a strong evidence-base for this service. This is particularly true in mentoring programs that are based in schools, which constitutes the most popular form of mentoring. While many forms of mentoring exist, the proposed study involves a school-based mentoring program that targets academic enablers through an instrumental mentoring curriculum. The first portion of this dissertation will offer an overview of youth mentoring by providing (a) a definition of youth mentoring, (b) the rational for using mentors in schools to promote academic and life success, (c) an overview of mentoring typologies, which distinguishes between instrumental and other forms of mentoring, (d) and a summary of the current outcome literature related to youth mentoring programs with particular emphasis on school-based mentoring programs. Based on this literature review, I propose that programmatic research that applies psychological and educational theory to mentoring policies and procedures that are subsequently rigorously evaluated is needed to achieve substantial and dependable benefits from school-based mentoring programs. Consistent with this recommendation, this the dissertation proposes a randomized efficacy trial of an innovative mentoring program that takes theory from research on academic enabling skills, social learning theory, and adolescent development and applies these to a novel transitional mentoring program for middle-school students transitioning from elementary school. The proposed trial was conducted on a sample of 134 6th and 7th grade students from a local middle-school.

39253295,Meehan (2005),2005,"This study examines a summer reading program, the Academy, designed to remediate students with reading difficulties before they enter grade three. The 11 male and 13 female students were studied and the researcher considered gender to determine whether there were differences in achievement by gender. Regardless of the strength of the reader for those students who participated in the Academy, there was no significant difference on the standardized tests by gender. Teacher training was an important factor in the Academy. The main components of the teacher training that were significant were being taught a set of specific strategies to use with the students and being provided with a daily schedule. A focus group was held to collect data from the teachers. Data collected was analyzed using the SPSS Program. To determine whether or not the Academy was making a difference, an independent t test statistics was conducted to compare the CTBS reading level scores of students and the ESPA reading scores of Academy participants and non-participants. Data by grade level were disaggregated to determine whether there were any statistical differences between grade levels. Comparison of the means of grades three, four, and five were also studied. The study also analyzed whether the reading achievement gains were made by those students who attended the Academy and if that achievement was sustained as the students moved from second grade (1999), to third grade (2000) and finally to fourth grade (2001). The Academy did what it was designed to do. It remediated students using an intensive reading program in a 4-week period. However, the amount of remediation seems to have little effect over time after 1 year. This could be due to the fact that this study was limited to such a small number of students  24 who went to the Academy and 10 who were accepted into the Academy and chose not to attend. Also, when the students returned to the regular classroom during the school year, they did not have intensive instruction, and therefore could not maintain that improvement. Additionally, they may not have had the same type of instruction as they received from the teachers in the Academy in which very specific reading strategies were taught during the four weeks of intensive instruction. This is reason in itself for students to lose the remediation they received during the Academy. During the Academy, the students are given at least 20 minutes of intensive instruction. During the school year, this is difficult with large class sizes and one teacher. The small class size was also an important factor in the success of the Academy as it provided teachers an opportunity to work one-to-one with students on a daily basis and give them the intense instruction to help them succeed. Intensive instruction appears to be one of the major factors for the success of student achievement in this study. Finally, this study was conducted on a very small sample because the researcher wanted to establish a baseline research for the Academy. It may be noted, also, that the Academy was in its experimental stage, being in its first year. All criteria for the program were done for the first time and now could be looked at and improved to become more effective and provide better significance over the years. Included in the criteria for further examination are  criteria used for admitting students into the Academy, material and programs to be used in the Academy, schedule to follow in the Academy, what to include in teacher training, and how could we improve assessment in the Academy.",['Summer schools'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8']",NA,NA,,8,"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""Students from any of the\neight elementary schools who qualified were entitled to attend.[¬e]""']",,,8,"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""Students from any of the\neight elementary schools who qualified were entitled to attend.[¬e]""']",,8,"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""Students from any of the\neight elementary schools who qualified were entitled to attend.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],Not provided,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Not assigned - naturally occurring sample,"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""24-second grade students who attended the Academy in 1999 were studied for the year 2000 and 2001.""\n""In addition, nine second grade\nstudents who were accepted into the Academy in 1999, but did not attend, were studied[¬e]""']",NA,,N,NA,NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 58:\n[¬s]""The criteria for inclusion in the program was based on the literacy scale from the district’s Primary Assessm ent Portfolio for grades K-2 and the length o f time that a child had been enrolled in basic skills for students who were in grades 3,4, and 5.[¬e]""', 'Page 59:\n[¬s]""Through input o f the reading specialist and elementary teachers students were recommended for the Academy.

Sparked by the America Reads Challenge Act of 1997, thousands of volunteer tutors are entering our schools to work with struggling readers. The America Reads Challenge (ARC), a federal grassroots call to action, is an unprecedented national campaign that challenges every American to help all our children learn to read, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency. Specifically, ARC proposes the use of adult volunteers to tutor children during and after school. Nationwide, thousands of ARC tutors serve their communities through Federal Work Study (FWS), AmeriCorps, VISTA, National Senior Service Corps, and Learn & Serve America. As a result of increased funding of these service organizations, hundreds of thousands of tutors are being sent into American public schools. Currently, 20,000 students at 1,100 colleges teach elementary students through the FWS program (“Rave Reviews,” 1999). Although volunteer tutors are not a new concept (Wasik, 1998), the sudden surge of thousands of volunteers in our public school systems is a phenomenon in need of study.

Second grade students (N = 46) from low-income families were randomly assigned to a treatment and control group during the summer break. Students in the treatment group received weekly home visits by a local bookmobile for 10 weeks during the summer vacation. At each visit, children were allowed to select up to five books from a wide variety of topics and genres. Students in the control group received no visits from the bookmobile. In the spring before school was out, in the fall upon returning to school, and in the winter of their third-grade year, students were assessed on measures of fluency (rate, accuracy, and automaticity), comprehension, and reading motivation. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any reading measure at first and second posttest except children's self-concept as readers. A comparison of gain scores on reading comprehension of only those students who had participated in at least 70% of the bookmobile visits versus those of the control group did indicate differences approaching statistical significance at first posttest.

37671570,Merrell (2015),2015,"Butterfly Phonics aims to improve the reading of struggling pupils through phonics instruction and a formal teaching style where pupils sit at desks in rows facing the teacher. It is based on a course book created by Irina Tyk, and was delivered in this evaluation by Real Action, a charity based in London. Real Action staff recruited and trained practitioners to deliver the intervention. These practitioners worked with trained teaching assistants to teach classes of six to eight pupils, although some groups were larger. Pupils were eligible for participation in the trial if they did not reach level 4 in their Key Stage 2 SATs or their reading skills were at least a year behind their chronological age. The evaluation was set up as a randomised controlled trial, which compared the progress of pupils who received Butterfly Phonics to a ""business-as-usual"" control group. Key conclusions include  (1) This evaluation provided evidence of promise  there was a positive, statistically significant effect on the primary outcome measure of reading comprehension. However, this effect size was lower than the minimum detectable effect size of the trial, so we cannot confidently conclude that the effect was due to the intervention and did not occur by chance  (2) The secondary outcome measures indicated positive impacts on children's literacy skills, but these were not statistically significant  (3) This intervention is recommended to take place during the school day, when it is easier to secure sustained co-operation and support from school staff. Where that support was present, the intervention was able to progress more satisfactorily than in schools where it was lacking  (4) Schools should ensure that people delivering the intervention receive training in the Butterfly method so that it is implemented as intended  and (5) Further research could investigate the intervention's impact on early readers. Its emphasis on larger word units and comprehension skills might enable a more rapid progression in early reading than a pure phonics course.

It also explored how tutoring contributed over and above the demographic factors of race and gender. To test tutoring effects, analyses were comprised of two components  a descriptive piece using ANOVAs, and a predictive piece using a step-wise regression. Results showed that tutors of elementary students did improve significantly in word recognition scores, untimed. No significant differences among groups on the other five measures existed, although the interaction effects showed significant differences for tutors in biology grades and attendance. White tutors had significantly higher grades than African American tutors. Male tutors missed more days from school, and white students missed more days than African American students. A significant gender effect was found in the behavior measure  males received a significantly greater number of discipline referrals than females.

The goal was to find an equivalent or more effective mathematics teaching method than traditional direct instruction. The purpose of this quantitative study was to compare the effectiveness of online instruction through ALEKS and traditional classroom direct instruction. Middle school mathematics student achievement was based on the Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment (MCA-III) and district-developed summative grade level concept test during the 2012-2013 school year. The findings show grades six and eight student achievement was significantly different, in favor of direct instruction, when comparing instruction methods on the district-developed concept tests. Grade seven student achievement was significantly different, in favor of direct instruction, when comparing instruction methods on the official spring 2013 MCA-III. When controlling for demographics, grade seven student achievement was significantly different, in favor of direct instruction, due to special education status. This research is valuable to mathematics teachers, curriculum directors, and principals evaluating the advances in mathematics instruction due to technology and the evolving future of education.

However, no evidence was found of the programme having an effect on reading comprehension or reading confidence and enjoyment of reading.

Data for this study consist of achievement test data from the spring 1998 administration for a large urban California school district for grades 2 through 6. Results of statistical analysis of the data show that there are two forms of opportunity segregation related to multitrack YRE in this district. First, YRE schools have lower achievement and more challenging student populations (that is, higher proportions of students with characteristics associated with lower achievement) than do traditional calendar (TC) schools. The second form of opportunity segregation is between tracks at YRE schools  it changes over time, solidifying and elaborating intertrack differences. The critical driving force behind this demographic, resource, and achievement segregation is parental choice. Parental political pressure to use vouchers to create learning opportunities for their students in multitrack YRE learning environments had contrary outcomes. At present, there is no compelling evidence that multitrack YRE education programs lead to improved student achievement. (Contains 43 references.)

Forty-seven first grade students (28 experimental, 19 comparison) who were formally screened and determined to be at risk for EBD participated in the study. Participants randomly assigned to the experimental condition received the standard reading curriculum plus an intensive supplemental reading intervention [i.e., Sound Partners (Vadasy, Wayne, O'Connor, Jenkins, & Pool, 1996)]. Sound Partners is an evidence-based, comprehensive, and intensive 100-lesson intervention that offers systematic and explicit instruction in phonemic awareness, letter-sound relationships, word identification, text reading, and writing. Participants in the comparison condition received the standard reading curriculum and a social adjustment intervention.  A pre/post experimental group design was used to address the following research question  What effects did the Sound Partners reading intervention have on the beginning reading skills of first grade students at risk for EBD? Results indicated that (1) the reading intervention was implemented with fidelity, and (2) participants in the experimental condition generally showed statistically and educationally significant improvements in measured reading skills across one standardized and three curriculum-based measures of beginning reading skills. Statistically significant differences were determined for one cluster (i.e., basic skills) and an overall reading score (i.e., total reading) of the standardized measure [i.e., Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised-Normative Update (Woodcock, 1998)]. Statistically significant differences were also determined for all three curriculum-based measures (i.e., nonsense word fluency, phoneme segmentation fluency, and oral reading fluency) of the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (Good & Kaminski, 2002). Treatment effects were moderate to large in magnitude.

According to Jongyeun (1999) ""A mentoring relationship constitutes a social capital that is critical to human development, because it enables students to develop the necessary attitudes, effort, and conception of self that they need to succeed in school and as adults."" The purpose of this research was to determine if mentoring in an after school program for elementary age students was associated with improvement in their academics and or behavioral outcomes and to determine how students and their mentors felt about their relationships and other experiences. The experimental group was a group of 30 students in the Teaching, Enriching, and Nourishing (TEN) After School Program that included mentoring and tutoring. The 21 TEN mentors were also a part of the study. A group of 30 students participating in the Extended Programs Learning Opportunities and Recreational Experiences (EXPLORE), an after school program that did not include mentors, was the comparative group. Data was collected for three areas including academic, behavioral and mentoring relationships. The academic data consisted of reading and mathematics report card grades, Pennsylvania System of State Assessments (PSSA) scores and the Wide Range Achievement Test 3 (WRAT 3) scores pre and post the program for the TEN students and post program for the EXPLORE students. The WRAT 3 which was administered post the program for the EXPLORE students. The behavioral data consisted of behavior report card grades, Conner's Feelings, Attitudes and Behavior Scales, Child Depression Inventory and the Conner's Teacher's Rating Scales for students in both after school programs. Finally, the data collected for mentoring relationships consisted of surveys which were completed by the TEN program mentors and the mentees. The academic outcomes demonstrated that the only group difference was in the area of the mean scores for the PSSA Reading results of the TEN students which were significantly higher than the scores for the EXPLORE students. The behavioral outcome demonstrated there was positive improvement in the TEN students' behavior report card grades, however, the differences were not significant. The mentoring function demonstrated that the mentors and mentees were able to develop some relationships. Even though the vi academic and behavioral outcomes did not significantly show that mentoring impacted academic achievement or behavioral growth the caring relationships that formed between the mentors and the mentees were viewed as important for those students whose relationships were positive and whose self-esteem may have also been positively impacted. This study provides some evidence that mentoring should be further studied as an important intervention in after school programs for elementary age students.",['Mentoring'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8', '9', '10', '11']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, but matched","['Page 55:\n[¬s]""The experimental group was selected and matched with the thirty students\nin the comparative groups’ family structures which were about the same and their\nbehaviors which were similarly matched on the Approaches to Learning section\nof the District’s report card.[¬e]""']",NA,,Individual,NA,NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 53:\n[¬s]""Two groups were involved in this study.

The general conclusion from the results of the tests of 1) intellectual ability, 2) visual-motor perception, 3) achievement, and 4) social growth and adjustment was that the former combination produced greater gains. Statistically significant differences in favor of the experimental group were actually obtained only with respect to the test of intellectual ability, but favorable trends were observed generally.

Research Findings  Findings demonstrate that the FOL intervention improved teachers’ ability to address children’s behavior problems and to provide a positive emotional climate in their classrooms. Importantly, the FOL intervention also improved the number of minutes of instructional time, although the quality of teachers’ instruction was not improved. Finally, FOL benefited children’s observed behavior in classrooms, with lower levels of conflictual interactions and, at the trend level, higher levels of engagement in classrooms activities, relative to similar students randomly assigned to control classrooms. Practice or Policy  This study is one of an emerging body of research on the efficacy of SEL programs for preschool children living in poverty.

39717218,Mostow (2003),2003,"A year-long study of 131 second and third graders in 12 classrooms compared three daily 20-minute treatments. a) Fifty-eight students in six classrooms used the 1999-2000 version of Project LISTEN’s Reading Tutor, a computer program that uses automated speech recognition to listen to a child read aloud, and gives spoken and graphical assistance. Students took daily turns using one shared Reading Tutor in their classroom while the rest of their class received regular instruction. b) Thirty-four students in the other six classrooms were pulled out daily for one-on-one tutoring by certified teachers. To control for materials, the human tutors used the same set of stories as the Reading Tutor. c) Thirty-nine students served as in-classroom controls,receiving regular instruction without tutoring. We compared students’ preto post-test gains on the Word Identification, Word Attack, Word Comprehension, and Passage Comprehension subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test, and in oral reading fluency. Surprisingly, the human-tutored group significantly outgained the Reading Tutor group only in Word Attack (main effects p > .02, effect size .55). Third graders in both the computer- and human-tutored conditions outgained the control group significantly in Word Comprehension (p > .02, respective effect sizes .56 and .72) and suggestively in Passage Comprehension (p = .14, respective effect sizes .48 and .34). No differences between groups on gains in Word Identification or fluency were significant. These results are consistent with an earlier study in which students who used the 1998 version of the Reading Tutor outgained their matched classmates in Passage Comprehension (p = .11, effect size .60), but not in Word Attack, Word Identification, or fluency. To shed light on outcome differences between tutoring conditions and between individual human tutors, we compared process variables. Analysis of logs from all 6,080 human and computer tutoring sessions showed that human tutors included less rereading and more frequent writing than the Reading Tutor. Micro-analysis of 40 videotaped sessions showed that students who used the Reading Tutor spent considerable time waiting for it to respond, requested help more frequently, and picked easier stories when it was their turn.

Eighty-eight students used the 2000-2001 version of Project LISTEN's Reading Tutor (www.cs.cmu.edu/~listen) in 10-computer labs, averaging 19 hours over the course of the year. The Reading Tutor served as a computerized implementation of the National Reading Panel's recommended guided oral reading instruction (NRP, 2000). The Reading Tutor listened to students read aloud, giving spoken and graphical help when it noticed them click for help, make a mistake, or get stuck. Students using the Reading Tutor averaged significantly higher gains across measures of reading ability, especially those involving word level skills (word identification, blending words, and spelling) than their matched classmates who spent that time doing Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) in their classrooms. Additionally, these students trended toward higher gains in fluency and reading comprehension.

The reading comprehension gains made by students in the Paraphrasing Strategy class (SIM) (Schumaker, Denton, & Deshler, 1984) were compared to a control group who participated in conventional learning assistance instruction (LA) and to a second control group who participated in no intervention other than regular inclusive placement (No-LA). The study also examines the role of reading disability in junior high school students achievement and relates both to work habits, absenteeism, and subject failure. The Stanford Diagnostic Reading Comprehension sub-Test (SDRCT) was used to evaluate reading achievement change scores from pretest to posttest. A one-way ANOVA on the change scores found that students participating in SIM increased their reading comprehension achievement scores significantly more than students in LA over the year. SIM students' mean reading comprehension gain was greater than one grade equivalent, indicating a net gain relative to age peers. Furthermore, there were non-significant trends for students in SIM to attend school more often and pass more subjects than students in learning assistance. Behaviour scores, calculated from work habit marks of the SIM, LA, and No-LA groups, were not significantly different. Differences in reading achievement gains for the SIM and LA groups are not attributed to absenteeism or behaviour. A multiple regression analysis found that significant predictors of failure to achieve in school were student behaviour, absenteeism, and SDRCT reading comprehension pretest scores.

The program designers hope to increase the number of these students entering the health sciences pipeline. The program includes video role-model stories featuring minority scientists and students, hands-on activities, and teacher resources. Collaborators from The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Spring Branch Independent School District, and the Health Museum developed the modules. METHOD  From 2004 to 2007, the authors used a quasi-experimental, two-group pretest/posttest design to assess program effects on students' performance and interest in science, their science self-efficacy, their fear of science, and their science-related careers self-efficacy. An independent third party matched the intervention school to a comparison school by test scores, school demographics, and student demographics and then matched pairs of sixth-grade students (N = 428) by fifth-grade science scores, gender, ethnicity, and participation in the free or reduced lunch program. The authors collected data on these students for three years. RESULTS  At eighth grade (2007), the intervention school students scored significantly higher (F = 12.38, P < .001) on the Stanford Achievement Test 10 in science and reported higher interest in science (F = 11.08, P < .001) than their matched, comparison-school pairs. Students in neither group reported an increase in their confidence to choose a science-related career, but students in one high-implementing teacher's class reported decreased fear of science.

Thirty-nine students from two fifth grade classes participated in the study.

Nineteen students in the control group received district curriculum reading instruction without metacognitive strategy instruction. These two fifth grade classes did not have significant differences on pre-test measures of formal or informal reading assessments. After a 15-week treatment period, posttest scores were indicative of significant differences between the experimental and control group that could be ascribed to metacognitive strategy instruction. Ten students from each group were interviewed assessing this metacognitive strategy use and reading ability. These students were also observed during the course of the study to determine whether the study's metacognitive strategies mentioned were actually used during non-instructional times. Students' interview responses before strategy instruction indicated that both groups used reading behaviors about reading as reading strategies. After metacognitive strategy instruction, only students in the experimental group stated text connections, visualization, and questioning as strategies used to aid comprehension of expository text. This further suggested that the experimental group was significantly affected by metacognitive strategy instruction. Findings for this research study suggested that after metacognitive strategy instruction non-proficient students' reading comprehension improved significantly on The Test of Reading Comprehension (TORC-3).

37671575,Nelson (2010),2010,"Broadly, the current study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive effects of PA (phonological awareness) interventions for preschoolers, demonstrating that PA instruction need not be postponed until kindergarten. Specifically, the current study addresses the paucity of research on PA training in preschool by testing the efficacy of a supplemental cohesive and explicit PA focused intervention that has been shown in previous studies to improve PA and alphabetic knowledge of at-risk kindergarteners. Second, the current study employs community-based paraeducator tutors as interventionists, and in so doing, extends other early K-1 reading research showing that paraeducators can deliver supplemental early reading interventions with a high degree of fidelity, particularly if the interventions are well scripted for non-certificated teachers' use. Finally, the authors chose to use a modified form of Interactive Book Reading as their comparison (control) condition to (a) control for supplemental instruction time and consistency, and (b) provide an alternative intervention approach appropriate for preschoolers. Indeed, studies support the benefit of interactive storybook reading for building emergent literacy skills  however, supplemental instruction that focuses on vocabulary acquisition has not, to date, been tested against explicit supplemental instruction in PA focused instruction with diverse (i.e., low socioeconomic, limited English proficiency) preschool children. Thus, this study also provides information regarding the relative impact of two approaches on preschoolers' PA and alphabetic and vocabulary knowledge. The primary research questions for the current study were  (a) does a supplemental PA focused intervention implemented by paraeducators have a direct, positive impact on at-risk preschool children's literacy outcomes?, and (b) does the intervention have a unique impact on children's outcomes, after controlling for pretest skill, classroom and home literacy environments, and treatment fidelity?

47269858,Nguyen (2008) M,2008,"This paper shows that increasing perceived returns to education strengthens incentives for schooling when agents underestimate the actual returns. I conducted a field experiment in Madagascar to study alternative ways to provide additional information about the returns to education  simply providing statistics versus using a role model–an actual person sharing his/her success story. Some argue that role models may be more effective than providing sta- tistics to a largely illiterate population. However, this proposition depends on how households update their beliefs based on the information the role model brings. Motivated by a model of belief formation, I randomly assigned schools to the role model intervention, the statistics inter- vention, or a combination of both. I find that providing statistics reduced the large gap between perceived returns and the statistics provided. As a result, it improved average test scores by 0.2 standard deviations. For those whose initial perceived returns were below the statistics, test scores improved by 0.37 standard deviations. Student attendance in statistics schools is also 3.5 percentage points higher than attendance in schools without statistics. Consistent with the theory, seeing a role model of poor background has a larger impact on poor children’s test scores than seeing someone of rich background. Combining a role model with statistics leads to smaller treatment effects than statistics alone, also consistent with the theory. The key implication of my results is that households lack information, but are able to process new information and change their decisions in a sophisticated manner. ∗I",['Mentoring'],NA,,Dissertation,NA,,NA,NA,,['Madagascar'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 19:\n[¬s]""The study sample consists of 640 public primary schools[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,intervention involves a volunteer visiting school to speak about their experience (ie educational and employment success) - feasible to organise,,"['9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15']","['Page 18:\n[¬s]""4th-graders[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""Grade 4 (aged 9-15) is the only treatment cohort.[¬e]""', 'Page 18:\n[¬s]""4th-graders[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""Grade 4 (aged 9-15) is the only treatment cohort.[¬e]""']",NA,,240,"['Page 43:\n[¬s]""Notes: “Any Statistics” Treatment refers to the second-row groups of schools. “Any\nRM” refers to the last three columns.

The study examines the relationship between peer tutoring and math achievement, the relationship between peer tutoring and attitude towards math. Specifically, the objective of this study was to answer the following questions  (1) Did students who received peer tutoring have higher achievement than those who did not? (2) Did students who received peer tutoring have a better attitude towards math than those who did not? (3) Was there a relationship between math achievement and attitude towards math? The methodology used for the study was the pretest-posttest experimental design. This allowed for detection of small, short term improvements. The t-test of difference for unmatched groups was used to analyze the differences in achievement and attitude between tutored and non tutored students. The Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient was used to determine if a relationship existed between achievement and attitude of the students who were tutored.

38296657,Nunes (2018),2018,"1stClass@Number was developed by the Every Child Counts (ECC) team at Edge Hill University to support pupils who are struggling with mathematics. The ECC team trained teaching assistants (TAs) to deliver highly scripted lessons to small groups of up to four children. The programme is normally implemented outside of mathematics lessons in other lesson time. It covers five basic mathematics topics  the number system, place value, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The lessons include the teaching of procedures (for example, counting on, counting up to, counting backwards, and counting in twos and in fives), mathematical signs (+, -, =) and mathematical language and concepts (such as more, less, and equal). Schools are advised to deliver 30 lessons of approximately half an hour, usually three times a week for ten weeks, and are encouraged to deliver additional sessions for pupils who need them. A classroom teacher colleague (the “Link Teacher”) is expected to meet the TA once a week to help them review and plan upcoming lessons, and provide feedback. 1stClass@Number was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial. 133 schools in South and West Yorkshire each nominated four children in Year 2 to participate in the project. The schools were then randomly assigned either to receive the intervention or to continue with their normal teaching in Year 2 and receive the opportunity to implement another ECC intervention with a different year group. The primary outcome for the trial was the Quantitative Reasoning Test, which focuses on number knowledge and mathematical problem solving, and the secondary outcome was performance in end-of-KS1 maths tests. A process evaluation collected additional data through observations, questionnaires, and phone interviews. The recruitment of schools began in September 2015 and the research completed in July 2017. The implementation of the intervention took place, approximately, between September 2016 and February 2017.

Supplementary instruction has been used extensively to accelerate struggling readers' progress  however, schools need to consider methods that have been examined for their effectiveness. This quasi-experimental study explored the effect of two supplementary instructional approaches, CORI-STAR and Guided Reading, on accelerating struggling readers' growth in reading comprehension, reading motivation, and metacognitive awareness, as well as their transference of strategies to their classroom reading groups, their application of reading strategies, and their metacognitive knowledge of reading strategies. Struggling third- and fourth-grade students were invited to participate in an 8-week supplementary instructional reading group. Fifty students with parental consent were then randomly assigned by classrooms to either the CORI-STAR or Guided Reading approach. CORI-STAR combined (a) the engaging and motivational elements of Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction (CORI) developed by John Guthrie, and (b) a metacognitive component, Strategic Thinking Applied to Reading (STAR), consisting of explicit instruction on metacognitive awareness, modeling, think-alouds, and reflective thinking. The Guided Reading approach was implemented according to Fountas and Pinnell's recommendations. The results revealed statistically significant time (pretest, posttest) by treatment interactions with large effect sizes favoring the CORI-STAR group on (a) three comprehension measures  WRMT-PC, QRI-4 questions, and QRI-4 retelling and (b) three metacognitive awareness measures to assess students' awareness of strategies, their application of strategies, and their metacognitive awareness of the declarative, procedural, and conditional knowledge of regulating their use of reading strategies. Performance on the Motivations for Reading Questionnaire did not show a statistically significant interaction for time by treatment. However, on another measure of motivation, choosing to take home books for reading, CORI-STAR students outperformed those in the Guided Reading group. Both groups were perceived by their teachers to transfer strategies to classroom use. Thus, students in the CORI-STAR group improved more than Guided Reading students on reading comprehension, metacognitive awareness, and their knowledge and use of reading strategies as a result of the intervention.

Both parents and teachers were overwhelmingly positive, citing the dramatic increase in reading ability by both tutees and tutors and the increase in feelings of self-worth among handicapped tutors. Two other experiments that featured learning disabled and behaviorally disordered students as peer and cross-age tutors are briefly discussed. Findings on individual progress charts and pre-post test gains indicated that handicapped students can be quite potent as tutors of other handicapped students. Findings of all four studies indicated that both tutors and tutees experience growth in the topic tutored, that socially isolated handicapped students often experienced increased social acceptance as a result of tutoring nonhandicapped peers, and that parents, teachers and tutees perceived reverse-role tutoring as an effective intervention strategy in special education.

Reciprocal teaching is a method in which the teacher participates both as a leader and as respondent. Before the experiment began, the teachers were trained for a day in reciprocal teaching and introduced to principles of collaborative learning, such as the joint role of student and teacher in acquiring comprehension strategies, the role of teacher modeling, and the importance of allowing students to lead discussions. Participants were 63 experimental and 66 control students. After pretesting, the teachers in the experimental classes introduced collaborative learning, and four reading comprehension strategies. Twenty days of reciprocal teaching followed, with each teacher implementing new stages in the process at the same time. Control groups used traditional basal reading instruction. During a 5-day maintenance phase, subjects completed daily assessment measures, after which students in both groups completed summarization and questioning transfer measures as a posttest. Three of the teachers were more comfortable with reciprocal teaching than the others, although assistance from leaders helped all six groups receive the same quality of instruction. Results revealed a significant improvement in experimental students' accuracy with recall and interpretation of material they read independently. Experimental subjects scored significantly higher on the posttests as well.

Study results were  Achievement test data were analyzed through doubly multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance using the Texas Learning Index (TLI) scores from the Spring administration of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS). No effects attributable to year-round education were discerned in reading and mathematics achievement over the three years in the study. Discipline data, analyzed by frequency distribution, indicated a decrease in disciplinary referrals and most types of offenses at the year-round campus for the two or three years with extant data. However, inconsistencies in the sources of data and the dramatic nature of the campus changes in administration over time, deemed it impossible to make a satisfactory evaluation of the year-round program and inadvisable to attribute these findings to the implementation of a year-round program at the campus. Log-transformed attendance data were analyzed through doubly multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance using the base-10 logarithm of the difference of 101 and the actual percentage attendance. A significant campus effect indicated that, averaged across three years, the year-round campus attendance was higher for the given samples of students. Recommendations were that the Harlandale Independent School District investigate the benefits of a single calendar concept district wide since there were no differences in overall achievement over the past three years attributable to the YRE program. Harlandale should investigate whether or not the decrease in discipline referrals and offenses at the YRE campus is attributable to the year-round calendar or inconsistencies in the sources of the data and administrative changes over time at the YRE campus.

(1) Do scores on a pre-algebra test for students who received one of four variations of tutoring differ significantly from each other and from the scores of students who did not receive one of these services? (2) Do scores on a post-algebra test for students who received one of four variations of tutoring differ significantly from each other and from the scores of students who did not receive one of these services? (3) Do scores on a post-post-algebra test for students who received one of four variations of tutoring differ significantly from each other and from the scores of students who did not receive one of these services?

A previous EEF-funded evaluation of Switch-on had shown signs of promise in raising reading outcomes for Year 7 pupils, hence a larger scale effectiveness evaluation was conducted. Each of the 184 participating schools were randomly assigned to receive either Switch-on Reading, Switch-on Reading and Writing, or continue their usual practices of supporting pupils with reading difficulties (called ‘business as usual’ control). Between two and four TAs in each school were trained to deliver the interventions by a team of trainers who were distinct from the developers. TAs received 1.5 days training for Switch-on Reading, and 2.5 days for Switch-on Reading and Writing. Each TA worked with between two and four Year 3 pupils who had not met age-related expectations in literacy at the end of Key Stage 1, and who did not have a high level of special needs. In total, 999 pupils were involved in the trial. The primary outcome measure was the Hodder Group Reading Test 2A. The evaluation was conducted over the 2015/2016 academic year.

40307342,Philbrick (2002),2002,"The comprehension of nonfiction text is often a difficult skill for elementary students to master. Because of its technical vocabulary, unfamiliar formats, and specialized organizational patterns, students often find the reading of expository text more difficult than narrative stories. Often, however, teachers assume if students can read stories, they can read textbooks. Research has shown that this is not always so. The purpose of this study was to determine if teaching children to actively process their social studies textbook using metacognitive reading strategies improved comprehension of the text. One hundred thirty-one fifth grade students in a rural midwestern intermediate school participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (1) a combination of metacognitive strategy and social studies content instruction, (2) a strategies only condition, or (3) a social studies content only group. During an eleven-week period, students received two 45-minute lessons a week. Students learned the use and value of four metacognitive strategies (i.e. predicting, questioning, thinking-aloud, and summarizing) and practiced them using either their social studies text or a piece of children's literature. Instruction in metacognitive strategy use resulted in significant gains in reading comprehension scores and increased metacognitive awareness in both the combined and the strategies only groups. In addition, the combined strategy group scored significantly higher on comprehension than either of the other groups.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether practice evaluating and reviewing papers of unknown students, using genre-specific evaluation criteria, could help students learn how to revise their own papers more effectively, resulting in papers of better quality. A total of 145 students in the fourth and fifth grades participated in this investigation. The students were randomly assigned within grade level into three groups  the reviewers, the readers, and the control group. All students responded to two persuasive topics in their homerooms. Those essays served as pretests and were administered on two consecutive days. On the third day, all students received training in evaluation criteria that were based on the elements of persuasion. The students were randomly assigned to the three conditions within their grade level and participated in three days of intervention. The reviewers read persuasive essays, evaluated them using the evaluation criteria, and gave written feedback to the writer. The group of readers read the same essays as the reviewers, but did not provide any feedback. The control group read books that did not relate to persuasion. For the next two days, students revised their pretest essays in their homeroom classrooms. On the third day after the intervention, all students wrote a persuasive essay on a new topic in their homerooms and revised their essay on the next day  this task was done to examine transfer.

Components of traditional instruction included  know-wonder-learn, question-answer relationship, retelling, story frames, and story maps. In addition to these, the three components in the multi-strategy approach in this study were reciprocal teaching, think-pair-share, and question/response cueing. The impact that the three component instructional approach had on reading comprehension was evaluated in a quasi-experimental study in which the reading performances of the 92 students in the treatment group were contrasted with the performances of the 93 students in the control group receiving traditional instruction. Students were heterogeneously grouped. To test the impact of multi-strategy instruction on reading comprehension, a two-way repeated ANOVA was computed using CTBS Fall to Spring and the treatment/control as the two independent variables. The dependent standardized measure incorporated to measure reading comprehension was the California Test of Basic Skills. The means and standard deviations for the total scores of the treatment and control groups were presented and found to be insignificant. It was concluded that the data analysis for the standardized scores for this study of reading comprehension did not favor the treatment or control group. Mean post-test minus pre-test differences for scores for the performance assessment measure were computed. Though numerical differences in favor of the treatment group on a Maryland State Performance Assessment prototype were noted, the weak validity of state performance assessments and small sample size of this study did not permit conclusions.

40134772,Pipal (1991),1991,"This study investigated the effects of an intervention program on variables related to school performance in which ninth-grade high school students served as subjects. Variables that served as indicators of program effectiveness were (a) grade-point average (GPA)  (b) proportions of students that attain 10th-grade status as measured by units of academic credit  (c) percent-correct scores on tests of academic skills in the areas of editing, mathematics, and reading  (d) rates of absence from classes  and (e) rates of referral for disciplinary action by teachers and administrators. Qualitative evidence of program effectiveness was secured through individual student interviews. The treatment consisted of an eight-week intervention program designed to assist all ninth-grade students in the transition from junior high school into high school. Program faculty presented six topics determined to be important to student success in high school. The treatment group consisted of 72 ninth-grade students who were matched with 72 control subjects on pretest measures of GPA and absence rate. Pretest measures of the dependent variables were taken from school records compiled during the first 10 weeks of the 9th-grade prior to student participation in the treatment program. Posttest measures of the dependent variables were taken from school records during the first full semester of the 9th-grade school year immediately following the treatment program and again during the first 12 weeks of the 10th-grade school year. Analyses of covariance demonstrated significant differences (p $<$.05) between the two groups for the first posttests of GPA and absence rates. Student interviews revealed that academic planning and improvement in study skills were the components of the treatment program that students considered most important to academic success. Results of this study provided empirical confirmation of the findings of previous research which indicated that high school intervention programs can positively affect GPA and attendance. The results also suggested that further gains in GPA and attendance might be promoted by increasing the length of the treatment program.",['Behaviour interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['14', '15']",NA,NA,,1,NA,,,1,NA,,2,"['Page 103:\n[¬s]""Ninth-grade students at Homestead High School were\nselected as the control group because Homestead High School was\nthe school in the Fremont Union High School District most similar\nto Cupertino High School[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,"['Page 106:\n[¬s]""The eight-week program consisted of 50 minutes of student\nparticipation each school day for 40 days.

School pre-registration lists provided names and socio-economic information for both the Head Start children and the control group children. Both groups were tested during the two weeks between the close of Head Start sessions and the first day of public school. Scores on measurement instruments were analyzed on the basis of 1) sex, 2) mother's educational level, and 3) family income level. The measure of learning rate as determined by the seguin form board was the most consistent in showing differences resulting from Head Start intervention.

40375911,Portwood (2005),2005,"This evaluation explores the effectiveness of school-based mentoring as a universal prevention strategy. The impact of mentoring on students displaying risk factors is also addressed. The evaluation of YouthFriends, a school-based mentoring program, employed a pretest-posttest control group design. Students (n = 170) across five school districts provided data on eight dependent variables. At posttest, there was a statistically significant difference favoring YouthFriends over controls on sense of school membership. In addition, for students who had low scores at baseline, results indicated a statistically significant improvement unique to YouthFriends on community connectedness and goal-setting. Analyses of students' academic performance also indicated a positive effect for those YouthFriends who had low grades at baseline. Editors' Strategic Implications  Important lessons are provided for school administrators and mentoring program staff and evaluators.

Research indicates misinterpretation of the equal sign occurs because students receive relatively little exposure to equations that promote relational understanding of the equal sign.

In the present study, second-grade students with MD (n = 51) were randomly assigned to standard equations tutoring, combined tutoring (standard and nonstandard equations), and no-tutoring control. Combined tutoring students demonstrated greater gains on equation-solving assessments and equal-sign tasks compared to the other two conditions.

Under this plan, schools remain in session throughout the year and students are assigned to one of four attendance cycles which begin 15 days apart. As a result of the staggered attendance pattern, only three groups (cycles) of students are in attendance at any particular time. The primary purpose of this evaluation was to assess the possible negative side-effects of the new attendance schedule by focusing on student achievement and student attitudes at the end of the first year of year-round education. General conclusions are that students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in pilot schools suffered no adverse effects on achievement in reading or mathematics, nor on attitudes toward learning or school, as a result of year-round schooling. Specifically, data suggests that sixth grade students improved in reading and mathematics, while their attitudes toward learning and school were more positive. Students with poor attitudes toward learning and towards school and relatively high ability students seemed to benefit from year-round schooling. Findings suggest continuance or expansion of year-round education at Virginia Beach.

40307255,Rabren (1994),1994,"Reading research has developed for more than a hundred years. Yet, it is only within the last 10 years that interest in research in the area of reading comprehension has increased. In spite of this growing interest in reading comprehension, few researchers have examined critical reading skills. Even fewer have investigated the critical reading skills of students with learning disabilities. A reading skill that is critical to understanding narrative text is comprehension of character motive. This is an important issue, as much of the reading material presented to students in the elementary grades is narrative text. This study compared two highly dissimilar approaches of teaching reading comprehension  explicit rule-based instruction and basal reader activity-based instruction. The rule-based model is based on the Direct Instruction Model developed by Sigfried Engleman and his colleagues. This instructional model emphasizes teaching students to apply specific rules and procedures to comprehend text. The basal reader activity-based approach is based on instructional formats developed from several basal reading programs. This approach focuses on motivational activities to develop the reader's interest in the text in order to improve his/her comprehension. In this study 40 students with learning disabilities in several schools were randomly assigned to treatment groups  explicit rule-based or basal reader activity-based instructional groups. Daily instructional sessions lasting 40 minutes were conducted for 2 weeks. The two groups were compared on retells of stories, results from unit tests, a transfer measure, and a maintenance measure. Finally, an attitude/satisfaction scale was used to determine if students showed a preference for either instructional method. Results of this study suggest that students with learning disabilities can benefit from explicit rule-based instruction of character motive.

37671611,Ratcliff (2009),2009,"Reading First (RF) is the largest and the foremost federal initiative in improving reading achievement of struggling students in high-poverty, low performing schools in the U.S. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the RF program on the early literacy acquisition of young children. The primary research question was to investigate whether first grade students in RF schools would have better reading performances than those students in non-RF schools as measured by Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) subtests. The secondary research question was concerned with whether third and fourth grade students in RF schools performed better than those students in non-RF schools on statewide-mandated English Language Arts (ELA) assessment measures. A three-year longitudinal study was conducted to examine the ELA scores between 2006 and 2008. The data were obtained from six elementary schools in two rural school districts in Louisiana. The results showed that the first grade RF students had better performances in reading than the non-RF students at the beginning of the school year 2007–08. However, the differences in the adjusted means of the DIBELS subtests (Nonsense Word Fluency and Oral Reading Fluency) were not statistically significant at the end of the school year. Also, all of the first graders in both the RF and non-RF schools demonstrated significant gains in their reading skills. As the non-RF schools had adopted some of the RF components in their reading instruction, the findings indicated that the RF practices, which were based on scientifically based reading research (SBRR), helped produce positive reading outcomes in both RF and non-RF classrooms. The study also confirmed the efficacy of using well-trained paraprofessionals as intervention implementers. As for the statewide-mandated ELA assessment, the findings of the longitudinal study indicated that the students in the RF schools performed better than those in the non-RF schools on statewide-mandated ELA assessments between 2006 and 2008. The study provided evidence that the efforts of the RF program in implementing research-based reading instructional strategies into classrooms were successful.

38296661,Rienzo (2016),2016,"Powerful Learning Conversations (PLC) sought to improve the feedback that teachers give to pupils in Year 9, by training them to apply techniques used in sports coaching. It is based on the idea that feedback in sports coaching is often provided immediately after a task is performed, and delivered in a way that children are more likely to respond positively to. The training programme adopted a 'cascade' model  expert teachers were trained in the approach and then expected to disseminate their training to English and Maths teachers in their school. PLC was developed in the UK secondary school context by the Youth Sport Trust (YST) in collaboration with the University of Exeter. This feasibility pilot study was conducted in 20 schools between January 2014 and November 2014. It had two aims  (1) to explore whether the programme is feasible and ready for a full-scale trial, and (2) to explore the effect on children's attainment and other outcomes of the programme. Key conclusions include  (1) There was no evidence that the programme had an impact on English attainment  (2) The evaluation detected a positive impact on Maths attainment, but this result is not secure and we are not able to draw firm conclusions about the programme's impact  (3) Interviews and observations with teachers found the programme was implemented in different ways and with different levels of understanding in different schools. This could be avoided by ensuring the programme and its underpinning concepts are more clearly defined  (4) The intervention is not ready to be evaluated using a large-scale trial without further development. In particular, it is important that the programme is more clearly defined and less open to interpretation by teachers  and (5) If the programme is taken to a full trial it is recommended that paper-based tests are used. The pilot provided mixed evidence of promise. There was no evidence that PLC had an impact on English attainment. The evaluation did detect an impact on Maths attainment, which was equivalent to six additional months' progress over the course of a year. However, it is important to note that these results, particularly the Maths result, should be treated with caution. The evaluation did not provide evidence of a differential impact on pupils eligible for free school meals or pupils with a low prior attainment. The evaluation provided mixed evidence regarding the programme's feasibility. The training was well attended by teachers and they appeared to be engaged. Nearly all teachers who took part in the training found it interesting, engaging and relevant to their teaching, and believed that their school as a whole would benefit from the programme.

43100730,Riggs (2006),2006,"Neuropsychology is one field that holds promise in the construction of comprehensive, developmental models for the promotion of social competence and prevention of problem behavior. Neuropsychological models of behavior suggest that children's neurological functioning affects the regulation of strong emotions, as well as performance in social, cognitive, and behavioral spheres. The current study examines the underlying neurocognitive conceptual theory of action of one social-emotional development program. Hypothesized was that inhibitory control and verbal fluency would mediate the relationship between program condition and teacher-reported externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Participants were 318 regular education students enrolled in the second or third grade. A series of regression analyses provided empirical support for (a) the effectiveness of the PATHS Curriculum in promoting inhibitory control and verbal fluency and (b) a partial mediating role for inhibitory control in the relation between prevention condition and behavioral outcomes. Implications are that programs designed to promote social and emotional development should consider comprehensive models that attend to neurocognitive functioning and development. Lack of consideration of neurocognitive pathways to the promotion of social competence may ignore important mechanisms through which prevention affects youth outcomes. Furthermore, the findings suggest that developers of social-emotional preventions should design curricula to explicitly promote the developmental integration of executive functioning, verbal processing, and emotional awareness. Doing so may enhance prevention outcomes particularly if those preventions are implemented during a time of peak neurocognitive development",['Social and emotional learning'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8', '9']","['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Ages ranged from 7 years 1 month to\n9 years 2 months at pretest, with a mean age of\n8 years 0 months.[¬e]""']",NA,,2,NA,,,2,NA,,4,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""All four schools that were ap-\nproached decided to participate and two were ran-\ndomly assigned to receive the prevention[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Schools were aware that once they decided to partic-\nipate, they had a 50% chance of being randomized as\na comparison school.

Results indicated that the traditional school students outscored the year-round students at mid-year. However, by the end of the year it was found that the year-round students slightly outscored the traditional school students. The year-round students' scores remained constant throughout the year, while the traditional school students' scores had a sharp rise at mid-term and a sharp drop at the end of the year. However, the difference at the end of the year did not compute to be a significant difference.

39717235,Ritter (2000),2000,"As a nation, we are struggling to identify means of preventing early academic performance problems, particularly in reading and mathematics. In various forms, academically-focused tutoring programs for young children are being promoted widely as promising strategies for improving academic performance. There is a body of evidence showing the benefits of tutoring provided by certified, paid professionals. However, similar evidence does not exist for tutoring programs employing adult volunteers or college students as tutors. This dissertation presents the results of an experimental-design study measuring the impacts on student outcomes of a major university-public school partnership that provides volunteer tutoring services for young students in inner-city elementary schools. The two primary hypotheses are  (1) Tutoring will lead to significantly improved academic outcomes as measured by academic grades and standardized test scores  and (2) Tutoring will lead to significant benefits in terms of student self-perception of academic ability, student motivation, and school attendance. The study sample is comprised of 385 elementary school students identified by their teachers as in need of tutoring services. From this pool of ""eligible"" students, approximately half (51 percent) were randomly selected to work with college-age tutors. The remaining students served as a study control group. Regression analysis was used to analyze the effectiveness of the tutoring and the impact of factors other than tutoring on several outcomes of interest related to academic performance, self-confidence, and motivation. There are two key findings from this study. First of all, the review of the research literature underscores how little we know about what, if anything, ""works"" in the way of volunteer tutoring to improve student outcomes. Second, the experimental-design study revealed no evidence that participation in the tutoring program during the 1998-99 academic year resulted in any measurable academic benefits for the tutees. The findings suggest that this type of intervention may not improve measurable academic outcomes in the short run.

37092595,Rosenthal (2006),2006,"A considerable amount of attention has focused on reading and mathematics difficulties of elementary-aged students. Significantly less attention has focused on the written expression problems of elementary-aged students, which is problematic given that approximately 6% of the school-aged population may have a disorder in written expression (Luttinger & Gertner, 2001). In an attempt to address this problem, the present study examined the effectiveness of a performance feedback intervention in improving the writing fluency skills of a group of elementary-aged students. In addition, this study attempted to examine whether varying the frequency of feedback affected the amount of improvement observed in students' writing fluency skills. A total of 42 students in three third-grade classrooms participated in the study. Each classroom was randomly assigned to one of three conditions  (a) no feedback  (b) performance feedback intervention once per week  or (c) performance feedback intervention three times per week. Growth in students' writing fluency (i.e., total words written, number of sentences, number of letter sequences) as well as spelling was assessed using a time series design. In addition, a prepost cohort design was utilized to assess changes in students' writing achievement on standardized measures. The results of this study indicated statistically significant differences in students' writing fluency growth (i.e., total number of words written) between the three conditions, with students assigned to the performance feedback intervention three times a week demonstrating more growth than the no feedback condition.

In this paper, we present results from a randomized study of a well-defined use of computers in schools  a popular instructional computer program, known as Fast ForWord, which is designed to improve language and reading skills. We assess the impact of the program on students having difficulty learning to read using four different measures of language and reading ability.

38296668,Rutt (2014),2014,"Catch Up® Numeracy is a one to one intervention for learners who are struggling with numeracy. It consists of two 15-minute sessions per week, delivered by teaching assistants (TAs). The approach is based on research indicating that numeracy is not a single skill, but a composite of several component skills that are relatively discrete. The intervention breaks numeracy down into ten elements, including counting verbally, counting objects, word problems and estimation. Pupils are assessed on each component and instruction is targeted on those areas requiring development. In this evaluation, the intervention was run for 30 weeks and delivered to Year 2-6 pupils who were struggling with numeracy, as identified by TAs. The Catch Up Numeracy intervention was compared to a ‘business as usual’ control group and a ‘time equivalent’ intervention group, who received the same amount of one to one teaching by TAs, but did not use Catch Up Numeracy. Those TAs delivering Catch Up Numeracy were supplied with detailed session plans and received three half-day training sessions, led by Catch Up and Dr Ann Dowker of the University of Oxford. The project ran from September 2012 to July 2013. The overall effect size of Catch Up Numeracy in comparison to the ‘business as usual’ control group was +0.21, meaning the programme led to a noticeable improvement in numeracy outcomes. This effect size suggests that, on average, pupils receiving the interventions would make approximately three additional months of progress over the course of the year compared to pupils that did not. However, the ‘time equivalent’ group also showed similar significant gains (+0.27), suggesting the effect is likely to be a result of regular and sustained one to one teaching, rather than an intrinsic benefit of Catch Up Numeracy. The study demonstrates that one to one teaching with TAs is an effective strategy to increase numeracy skills in Year 2-6 pupils. Sub-group analysis did not identify any differential effects for pupil gender or eligibility for free school meals. The process evaluation indicated that most TAs valued Catch Up Numeracy and believed it had a positive impact on pupils’ confidence, engagement with learning and willingness to attempt numeracy problems.","['Teaching assistants', 'One to one tuition']",NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England', 'Wales']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11']",NA,NA,,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],Not provided,,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 6:\n[¬s]""hree groups: a control group that received normal teaching, a Catch Up Numeracy intervention group that received the intervention as described above, and an ‘equivalent time’ group that received two 15 minute sessions a week without Catch Up Numeracy, to replicate the one to one nature of the intervention.[¬e]""']",NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 13:\n[¬s]""This was a pupil-randomised trial but the randomisation was stratified by school.[¬e]""', 'Page 9:\n[¬s]"" Teaching assistants were randomised to one of two intervention groups: one delivering a time equivalent intervention and the other delivering the Catch Up intervention.

The intervention matches books to pupils according to their reading ability, which pupils then read to a teaching assistant (TA), so is intended to also support the development of their comprehension skills. In this evaluation, the intervention was delivered through two 15-minute sessions per week over 30 weeks at the transition from primary to secondary school, with a break for the summer holidays. Pupils were identified by their Year 6 teachers in their feeder primary schools as being struggling readers who were predicted to achieve below level 4b in reading.

The program evaluated is Early Steps, an intervention with one‐to‐one tutoring and with particular emphasis on story reading, writing, and phonological skills. Four neighborhood schools were selected to participate in the study—two experimental and two control schools. The 49 children came from lower‐ to middle‐class Caucasian families with similar socioeconomic backgrounds. The design of the study includes pre‐, post‐, and retention assessments of an experimental and a control group. Various tests were used to assess spelling performance, word recognition, nonword reading, and reading comprehension. The results at the end of Grade 1 and at the beginning of Grade 2 indicate that the experimental group performed statistically significantly better than the control group on all variables assessed. In particular, the children with the lowest pretest levels, the very high‐risk children, benefit most from the intervention. Their improvement approaches the average performance level after an intervention period of 8 months. We presume that the substantial progress among high‐risk children reflects the importance of a balanced approach to beginning reading and the power of the Early Steps program to increase the phonological and word study skills among those children most at risk in this domain.",['One to one tuition'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7']",NA,NA,,2,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""—tw o ex-[¬e]""', 'Page 6:\n[¬s]""perimental[¬e]""']",,,2,"['Page 6:\n[¬s]"" two control schools[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Four neighborh oo d schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],Not provided,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, not matched prior to treatment",NA,NA,,School - cluster,NA,"4 schools. 2 assigned to experimental, 2 assigned to control group ",,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 7:\n[¬s]"" The children from each experi m ent al and control class were ranked from highest to lowest, and the 20% in each class with the lowest combined scores were selected to participat e as experiment al or control subjects in the study.[¬e]""']",NA,,Not applicable,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

Students using the software receive immediate feedback, providing real-time tutoring. The software is designed to understand methods that a student may use to solve a problem, and provides individualized levels of help. The software paces the curriculum based on each student’s comprehension and ability. Student progress is displayed on their computer screen during the lab. Teachers can generate detailed reports of student progress. The class sessions are designed around collaborative student activities and projects. By design, teachers are encouraged to focus their direct instruction to students who need additional help. Course materials include student and teacher editions of textbooks and computer software.

40307438,Sato (1996),1996,"With the renewed interest of state and federal agencies in reading reform (Colvin, 1996), current reading research must be concerned with both (1) accounting for underlying processes in reading and their relationships among each other, and (2) providing recommendations for the content and method of effective reading instruction (Kamil, 1984). At present, the conditions under which much reading research is conducted often limit its potential contribution to understanding critical reading processes and fail to resolve the discontinuity that exists between research and practice (Phye & Sanders, 1992  Venezky, 1984). The present study attempts to address both theoretical and practical concerns in reading by comparing the effectiveness of two forms of instruction on fourth-grade students' strategy use, metacognition, and comprehension. Three schools in Los Angeles county participated in the present study, yielding a total of 259 fourth-grade students. Over the course of this five-day study, students were assessed along three major dimensions  strategy use, metacognition, and comprehension. The methods used in this study were based on cognitive theory and models of learning and were refined through successful collaboration with teachers and other education professionals. The data produced in this study identified several processes involved in comprehension and instructional factors that facilitated comprehension. What is encouraging from these results is that, with only four days of instruction, students appeared able to learn and apply the reading comprehension strategies that were presented to them. Moreover, students from both high and low reading ability groups exhibited oognitive and metacognitive gains from using these strategies. The present study can thus serve as a model for translating theory into practical classroom applications that enhance learning outcomes. If national levels of reading achievement are to improve, research and practice must engage in such collaboration to develop instructional programs that identify critical aspects of reading, contribute to our understanding of reading development, provide better indicators of learning, and inform effective means for remediation.",['Reading comprehension strategies'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Founh-grade students were selected for this study[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""the schools were large\nenough to have three fourth-grade classes a[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10']","['Page 7:\n[¬s]""fourth-grade[¬e]""']",NA,,3,NA,,,3,NA,,3,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,9,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""were randomly assigned to one of\nthe three instructional conditions.[¬e]""']","a) comprehension instruction (COMP),  b) comprehension instruction + metacognition (COMP/MET), and  c) no instruction (CONTROL)",,Random (please specify),"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""the three participating teachers were randomly assigned to one of\nthe three instructional conditions.[¬e]""']",NA,,Class,"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""he three participating teachers were randomly assigned to one of\nthe three instructional conditions[¬e]""']",NA,,['Multisite RCT'],NA,NA,,Yes,"['Page 8:\n[¬s]""Therefore, a randomized block design was used;\nstudents from each of the participating classes were first grouped by gender (male,\nfemale) and then rank ordered within gender according to their percentile rankings prior\nto random assignments to one of the three instructional conditions[¬e]""']",NA,,['Yes'],NA,metacognitive questionnaire but this was for another treatment groups which we are not interested in this extraction,,['Other types of student outcomes (Please specify)'],"['Page 11:\n[¬s]""The metacognitive questionnaire contained 25[¬e]""']",NA,,NA,NA,

Together, the adolescent student and tutor create educational devices which the adolescent in turn uses to tutor elementary school pupils. A pre-post experimental design is used to evaluate the two specific objectives listed and their components  academic remediation (academic achievement, intellectual ability, written expression, and school grades) and psycho-social growth (internal external locus of control, self concept, classroom and home behavior, self rating of behavior, and adjustment). Findings indicate that program participants increase their academic knowledge and skills in that pupils are able to maintain and exceed the academic growth expected of normal students. As a group, pupils in the program grow from a functioning range indicative of low average intelligence to the average intelligence range. Participation in the program seems to have an effect on the students' personal development (as indicated by an increase in internal orientation to life) and by favorable changes on important attitudinal and behavioral dimensions indicative of positive mental health.

High rime neighbourhood (HRn) non-words (e.g. ‘dat’ – with many real word rime neighbours) and low rime neighbourhood (LRn) non-words (e.g. ‘tav’ with few real word neighbours) were used to evaluate onset-rime- or grapheme-phoneme-based decoding strategies. Results showed greater phonological onset-rime skills, lettersound knowledge and non-word reading skills in all LSA-taught intervention groups. There was no difference between the HRn and LRn non-words. The only reliable difference between the intervention groups was an advantage in phoneme blending for the rime-taught group.

Thirty-seven teachers from across the United States used a Web-based system to register participants (n = 148), received random assignment of the at-risk students from this system, and submitted complete data sets. Performance levels were measured at 3 points across the year on M. M. Clay's (1993a) observation survey tasks, 2 standardized reading measures, and 2 phonemic awareness measures. The intervention group showed significantly higher performance compared with the random control group and no differences compared with average groups. Further analyses explored the efficiency of Reading Recovery to identify children for early intervention service and subsequent long-term literacy support.

38296671,See (2018),2018,"Maths Counts aims to raise the attainment of children who struggle with basic mathematics at Key Stage 2. The intervention was developed by The Mead Community Primary School drawing on the principles of the Numbers Count programme developed by Every Child Counts at Edge Hill University. Maths Counts lessons last 30 minutes and take place at least three times a week for a minimum of ten weeks. Schools have access to an online tool that stores information about pupils’ progress, supports the planning of lesson objectives, and suggests activities and resources for each lesson. The first ten minutes of Maths Counts lessons focus on recall and reinforcement of prior learning, and the following 20 minutes introduce new knowledge and skills. The online tool suggests activities and resources to use, such as throwing and catching a soft football in order to count in sequenced steps or using coins to develop an understanding of money. In this project, schools selected pupils in Years 3 to 6 to participate in the intervention, prioritising pupils at risk of not achieving nationally expected levels, younger pupils, and pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium. The intervention was delivered on a one-to-one basis by teaching assistants. Schools were able to approach the timetabling of the intervention flexibly, so some lessons were scheduled during maths lessons while some took place elsewhere in the school day. Teaching assistants were supported by their schools’ maths leads (the school’s maths co-ordinator or specialist teacher). Support for delivery of the intervention was provided by the Mead Academy Trust project team. Before the intervention started, the project team provided two days of training for both maths leads and teaching assistants. The maths leads then delivered four further training sessions throughout the intervention to the teaching assistants in their school. After an initial development phase where the project team developed a website and the online tool, Maths Counts was evaluated by Durham University using a randomised controlled trial involving 291 pupils across 35 schools. Each school identified eight eligible pupils, four of whom were randomised to receive the intervention while the other four formed the ‘business as usual’ comparison group. The trial tested the impact of Maths Counts on maths attainment measured using the General Maths component of the CEM InCAS assessment. The implementation and process evaluation consisted of observations and interviews. School recruitment began in early 2016 and the project ended when pupils were tested in April 2017.","['Teaching assistants', 'One to one tuition']",NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8', '9', '10', '11']",NA,NA,,35,"['Page 26:\n[¬s]""School n= 35[¬e]""']",,,35,"['Page 26:\n[¬s]""School n= 35[¬e]""']",,35,"['Page 26:\n[¬s]""School n= 35[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],Not provided,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" Each school identified eight eligible pupils, four of whom were randomised to receive the intervention while the other four formed the ‘business as usual’ comparison group.

The project evaluated two intervention components  a two week camp for children and two training workshops for parents. Data were collected for five groups of participants. Three groups participated in one or more intervention components  parent workshops only group, child camp only group, and both parent workshops and child camp group. All children who participated in the interventions were identified by teachers as having difficulty in phonological awareness and word reading skills at the end of senior kindergarten. Two additional groups served as comparisons. Children in the 'low' comparison group had early literacy skills similar to children in the intervention groups. The 'average' comparison group included children that were identified by teachers as normally achieving in early literacy. The intervention programs sought to improve children's word reading ability by providing explicit instruction in phonological awareness and opportunities to practice other emergent literacy skills. Children participated in pre- and post-test assessments measuring literacy skills and general cognitive skills. Children in all three intervention groups showed positive change following the intervention compared to a comparison group of children with similar initial abilities who did not receive any intervention. Children who received both intervention components showed the most positive change following a follow-up assessment at the end of grade one. The frequency of home literacy activities with parents was related to positive improvement in children's phonological awareness and word reading skills.

46844870,Shamir (2006),2006,"The objectives of the current study were to examine  (a) the effects of the Peer Mediation with Young Children (PMYC) program on mediators' & learners' mediation style in the context of maths teaching  & (b) the interaction effects of the intervention program, children's verbal ability, & maths level on pre- to postintervention improvement in maths & mediation style. The sample was composed of 108 pupils (54 mediator -- learner dyads), equally divided between an experimental & a control group. In each dyad, the mediator was from Grade 3 & the learner from Grade 2. Mediators & learners in each pair were matched in a counterbalanced design (2 x 2) according to their level of maths skills (high versus low). The experimental children received the PMYC program whereas the control children received general preparation for peer-assisted learning only. Following the PMYC intervention, all children participated in a peer-mediation condition where the mediators taught their younger peers how to solve maths problems. The interaction was videotaped for 25 minutes & analysed by the Observation of Mediation Instrument. The main findings showed that the experimental children obtained significantly higher scores on all mediation criteria & improved their pre- to post-intervention scores in maths to a greater degree than did the control children. These findings are explained in relation to Vygotsky's & Feuerstein's theories in addition to previous findings on peer mediation. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 47 References.

It is a structured, multisensory programme that covers reading and spelling from simple phonics skills through to adult reading levels. It involves a high level of independent work by the student, with small groups of students supervised by a teacher or teaching assistant. Each ‘unit of sound’ (or phonic code) is introduced separately, then used in words, and then sentences. This evaluation assessed the reading ability of 786 Year 7 students in 45 schools. Students were randomly assigned within the schools to receive the intervention if they had scored below Level 4 on their Key Stage 2 SATs. The evaluation was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of 23 projects focused on literacy catch-up at the primary-secondary transition for students who did not achieve Level 4 in English by the end of Key Stage 2. Two staff members in each school were identified to implement the interventions with groups of approximately five Year 7 students at a time. The designated teachers/teaching assistants in the participating schools undertook the 10-hour initial online training in UofS. Of the 45 schools that took part in the study, 31 had four sessions of additional face-to-face training and support from Dyslexia Action (DA) coaches and 14 had only online distance training and support instead of face-to-face support. Students spent one 60-minute session with the teaching assistant present and a further 30-minute session on another day working independently on the material covered with the teaching assistant. Schools varied in how they allocated the time. The intervention lasted for 18 weeks. Students were evaluated at baseline on the New Group Reading Test (NGRT) and then at follow-up on the NGRT and the Single Word Spelling Test (SWST). A light-touch process evaluation was conducted to determine teaching assistants’ and students’ perceptions of the programme.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the summer school Step Up Program increases self-esteem resulting in improved attitudes toward study, increased attendance, academic success and improved student behavior. Method. Eighty students from two schools were involved in this study. Forty students who chose to attend the summer school Step Up Program formed the experimental group and forty students who were eligible to participate in the Step Up Program but chose not to participate in this program formed the control group. All students were given the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory at the end of their eighth grade year to determine their levels of self-esteem and the Study Attitudes and Methods Survey to determine their attitudes toward study. In addition, baseline data on attendance, grade point averages, and behavior incidents were collected. At the conclusion of the summer program both the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) and the Study Attitudes and Methods Survey (SAMS) were given again to both groups as a posttest. At the conclusion of the first quarter of these students' ninth grade year the SEI and SAMS surveys were again administered as a follow-up. Follow-up data on attendance, grade point averages, and behavior incidents were also collected at the end of the first quarter of the students' ninth grade year. Results. The study results showed that the experimental group had significantly higher scores in attitudes in the areas of Academic Interest and Study Methods than the control group. Small but significant improvements in grade point averages were also noted for the experimental group when compared to the control group. No significant differences in self-esteem, attendance, or behavior referrals were noted. Although not statistically significant, anxiety about school performance and the tendency to manipulate teachers for favorable treatment warrant further study.","['Behaviour interventions', 'Summer schools']",NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['13', '14']",NA,NA,,2,"['Page 105:\n[¬s]""Two schools (Loara High School, Katella High School) were chosen to participate in this study[¬e]""']",,,2,"['Page 105:\n[¬s]""Two schools (Loara High School, Katella High School) were chosen to participate in this study[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 105:\n[¬s]""Two schools (Loara High School, Katella High School) were chosen to participate in this study[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Not assigned - naturally occurring sample,"['Page 102:\n[¬s]""The control group consisted of forty students who were eligible to participate in the Step Up Program but elected not to participate.""\n""These students and their parents chose whether or not to\nparticipate in the study.

Student-achievement data for years 1990-95 were compared by type of school schedule. A case-study component examined the impact of school schedules used by two elementary schools--one adhered to a traditional calendar and the other followed a multitrack year-round calendar. Data were gathered through interviews with all four administrators and all six fifth-grade teachers and through a survey of 114 fifth-grade students and 123 parents. Multitrack schools appeared to provide a slightly superior educational experience for students in terms of enhancing reading ability as well as in terms of increasing the bottom of the range of scores within a school. Parents of both school types generally supported their respective school programs and calendars. Student academic performance in multitrack year-round schools over a 6-year period exceeded the performance of students in traditional schools, while nonacademic outcomes were roughly equal. The findings also identified issues that required more attention--issues of support services, inservice and professional development, staff collaboration and communication, and vacation time. However, administrators believed that these difficulties could be overcome by utilizing different communication strategies, by changing the timing of inservice activities, by extending school activities into the community, or by sponsoring a variety of public events. Some criteria for examining the efficiency of school schedules are suggested. Clarification of the distinctions between those school differences that are conceptual and those that are operational is important. Three tables are included. (Contains 24 references.)

40307351,Shortland-Jones (1986),1986,"The purpose of this study was to develop and test an instructional strategy to improve elementary students' reading comprehension. Drawing on recent findings of research on metacognition and schema theory, the strategy combines instructional techniques involving student use of graphic overviews with reciprocal teaching instructional techniques designed to engage student metacognitive processing during reading. The four steps of the strategy are  (a) activation of prior student knowledge and teaching of vocabulary and concepts necessary for reading the text, (b) use of graphic overviews to represent the text structure, (c) reading of the text and having students generate questions and summaries to integrate the information contained in the text with the graphic overview, and (d) review of the text content and student-generated questions and summaries. Seven elementary teachers and their students enrolled in a Summer School reading program were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions. The experimental group was trained to use the instructional strategy in a series of workshops over a four-week training period. Teachers were required to practice the strategy in daily reading lessons. The control group received the same amount of training, but in a comprehension instruction strategy based on schema theory. Both groups received weekly observations, feedback, and additional informal coaching sessions from trained observers. Teacher implementation of the instructional strategies was determined from observer ratings on checklists designed for each strategy. Results indicate that both groups of teachers were successful in implementing their respective instructional strategies. Effects of training on student performance was assessed using pretest and posttest measures of (a) student ability to generate summaries and questions of text they had just read, (b) reading achievement (assessed by both standarized and informal tests), and (c) ability to write narrative and expository prose. Experimental-group students had substantially higher scores on measures of summary and question generation and moderately higher scores on tests of reading achievement. Several of these effects were statistically significant. The results are consistent with findings of previous research.

The two criteria tested were  (1) the theory of interpersonal cognitive problem solving (ICPS) skills as mediators of social adjustment and psychological functioning in inner-city fifth and sixth graders  and (2) the impact of a full-scaled four month ICPS intervention on behavioral adjustment and psychological functioning in school. By comparing ICPS-trained subjects (interpersonal cognition) with a group trained in Critical Thinking (impersonal cognition), investigators examined cognitive and behavioral impact after one exposure in grade 5, and after two exposures in grades 5 and 6. Results suggest that for this age and socio-economic status (SES) group, one exposure to ICPS training enhances ICPS and prosocial behaviors, but it requires a second exposure to reduce negative, impulsive, and inhibited behaviors. With no such interpersonal or behavior gains in the Critical Thinking (CT) groups for either year (CT groups actually became more impulsive from grade 5 to grade 6) it appears that ICPS training is a viable model of prevention for this age and SES group.

It is targeted at children with relatively poor spoken language skills. Three sessions per week are delivered to groups of two to four children starting in the final term of nursery and continuing in the first two terms of reception in primary school. Children in primary school also attend an additional two 15-minute individual sessions per week. All sessions focus on listening, narrative and vocabulary skills. Work on phonological awareness is introduced in the final ten weeks. The intervention was developed by researchers from the University of York with funding from the Nuffield Foundation. The communications charity I CAN was enlisted to train teaching assistants and nursery staff to deliver the programme. This report evaluates the I CAN-led model for the 30-week programme described above and also a shorter 20-week version delivered only in reception year. The impact of these two programmes on the language skills of 350 children in 34 schools was tested using a randomised controlled trial design. Schools with attached nursery schools or nursery classes in Yorkshire and the South East were recruited to the trial in 2013. Children identified as having relatively low language skills were randomly allocated to the 30-week programme, the 20-week programme or standard provision. The qualitative fieldwork carried out as part of the project involved interviews with a total of 12 staff in 8 of the 34 participating schools. Key conclusions include  (1) The Nuffield Early Language Intervention had a positive impact on the language skills of children in the trial. This is true for both the more expensive, 30-week version, starting in nursery, and the 20-week version, delivered only in school  (2) Children receiving the 30-week version experienced the equivalent of about four months of additional progress, compared with about 2 months additional progress for the 20-week version. Both results are unlikely to have occurred by chance, though results for the 30-week version are more secure  (3) The evaluation did not provide reliable evidence that either version of the programme had a positive impact on children's word-level literacy skills  (4) Teaching assistants delivering the programme reported that they found it difficult to devote enough time to it, and that support from senior staff was required to protect the programme time  and (5) Staff in participating schools reported that the programme had a positive impact on children's language skills and confidence. They thought that the factors which contributed to this included the small-group format, the activities covered, and the focus on narrative and vocabulary work.

38296677,Siddiqui (2014),2014,"This pilot project focused on improving teachers’ understanding and use of effective feedback. Participating teachers tried to incorporate feedback into their lessons to help pupils understand their learning goals and become able to develop strategies to reach them. The project employed a cyclical action research design, through which teachers reviewed academic literature on effective feedback before developing ways to apply it in the classroom. The project took place over one school year and involved nine treatment and five comparator schools in the London Borough of Bexley. All pupils in Years 2-6 took part in the study. Existing international research suggests that improving the quality of feedback in the classroom has the potential to improve learning significantly. However, studies also highlight the difficulties in improving feedback in practice, and there are few clear examples of how to improve feedback in English schools. This project sought to develop a way of improving feedback led by schools. The pilot evaluation had three aims. First, to assess the feasibility and promise of an approach to improving feedback which required schools to review, understand and apply research findings, including academic papers. Second, to provide formative recommendations that could be used to improve the approach in the future. Third, to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the approach’s impact on academic attainment that could be used to inform any future trial. The approach is feasible and there are some indications of promise. All nine schools completed the action research programme and at the end of the year many staff were receptive and enthusiastic about the approach. A number of good lessons with clear use of feedback strategies were observed. However, in common with existing studies on feedback, there was wide variation in the way that strategies to improve feedback were used. The estimated impact findings showed no difference between the intervention schools and the other primary schools in Bexley in terms of annual progress towards Level 4 at Key Stage 2 or in terms of value-added progress scores. However, due to the non-random nature of the comparison and the small number of schools involved it is difficult to draw conclusions with this. The results should not be confused with those of a full trial. Pupils eligible for free school meals made more progress in participating schools than in comparison schools.

Additionally, the experimental group received instruction about characteristics of fourth graders, collaborative learning, expectations of tutors, and instructional ideas to use with the tutees. Scores on unit tests were collected prior to the activity, and again after each unit was completed. Analysis of the data was completed using the General Linear Model from SPSS 10.0 software. The analysis used ANOVA and regression. Data indicated a statistically significant relationship, at p < .05, between the unit, pretest and posttest, and special education students. The special education students scored higher on pretests or posttests than their regular education counterparts. Also, special education students showed statistically significant results, at p < .05, on application level questions for two of the units. The special education students showed positive gains with respect to scores on application questions on pretests or posttests.

Further analyses demonstrated that an increased satisfaction of the mentored students Basic Psychological Needs (BPN) promoted better school performance outcomes when compared with non-mentored students with an identical perception of BPN support.

The two major questions this study attempted to answer were whether the learning disabled pupils who received peer-tutoring made significant gains in math computation and math concepts/application over the learning disabled pupils who received no peer tutoring and whether the learning disabled students who provided tutoring made significant gains in math computation and math concepts/application over the learning disabled students who did not provide tutoring. The study utilized a cross-age peer-tutoring model in which eleventh and twelfh-graders tutored ninth and tenth-graders on a one-to-one basis. The sample consisted of 100 learning disabled students drawn from two secondary schools. The California Achievement math sub-tests of Math Computation and Math Concepts/Applications was used as a measure to determine pre- and post-test results. The study covered a period of nine weeks with 15 minutes of tutoring four days a week. A Two-Way Analysis of Variance using repeated measures design was employed for analyzing test results. The results indicated that the peer-tutored group of learning disabled students made significant gains in both math computation and math concepts/applications scores over the non-peer-tutored group of learning disabled students, while the learning disabled peer-tutors made significant gains only in math concepts/applications scores over the learning disabled non-peer pupils. The findings were not significant for the peer-tutors in math computation. Therefore, three of the four null hypotheses were rejected with the results being significant at the .01 level of significance. Peer-tutoring is, therefore, a useful strategy in delivering individualized instruction to those who need it. It is one of the most pragmatic ways of reducing classroom pressures of teachers.

It is an internationally-used, well-developed programme aimed at class teachers of children in Years 1 and 2, run by the independent charity Partnership for Children. There is indicative evidence that the social skills and self-regulation skills developed through Zippy’s Friends could also improve children’s academic attainment. This project aimed to test the impact of Zippy’s Friends on academic attainment (in reading) and emotional self-regulation among Year 2 pupils. Zippy’s Friends consists of 24 weekly 45-minute sessions delivered over one school year. Six modules cover stories about a pet stick insect called Zippy and a group of young children who are his friends. Children are actively engaged in the stories through questioning, and learning is consolidated using games, activities, role-playing, and discussion. Zippy’s Friends was delivered by class teachers during the 2016/2017 school year. The evaluation involved 83 schools from five English local authorities, and 3,904 children. The evaluation was designed as an efficacy trial, with schools randomly allocated to an intervention group to teach Zippy’s Friends or a control group to continue teaching as normal. Interviews, observations, and focus groups were conducted with teachers, local co-ordinators, pupils, and parents.

Treatment consisted of a seven-week intervention program which included twelve sessions of academic tutoring held after school, direct instruction in study and organizational skills, recreational activities, counseling, six parent seminars, and focused staff communications. To examine differences in academic performance over time, pre- and post-treatment student grades in the academic core subjects of English, social studies, mathematics, and science were analyzed. To examine differences in school attendance over time, percentage of school days attended for a calendar period matching that of the study during the prior school year and percentage of school days attended during treatment were analyzed. To examine differences in attitude toward school over time, pre- and post-treatment student scores on a standardized attitudinal assessment were analyzed. Results indicated that significant differences did not exist between students in the treatment and control groups for academic achievement, school attendance, or attitude toward school.

37133968,Smith (2010),2010,"Fluency with multiplication facts is reported as critical in nearly every recommendation related to math performance in the United States, yet many students fail to show mastery despite teachers' efforts. The National Math Advisory Panel correlated math ability with increased opportunities for college and career options, thereby impacting future income. This quantitative study was conducted using a pretest-posttest control group model to examine the effectiveness of two modes of intervention aimed at improving automatic recall of multiplication facts. The target population was 4th and 5th grade students who had not yet mastered one digit by one digit facts. A total of 116 participants were recruited from one suburban public school district in the Midwest. A computer-aided intervention using the Fluency and Automaticity through Systematic Teaching with Technology (FASTT) Math program and a peer-tutoring intervention model following the Mastering Math Facts protocol was implemented for 10 minutes each school day for a 6-week period. Analysis of the pretest - posttest data indicated that the FASTT Math group made statistically significant gains in mean multiplication fact automaticity when compared to the control group F(1,67) = 6.19, p<.05. Although gains were made by the peer-tutoring group, the results were not statistically significant. Future research on increasing fluency with multiplication facts is needed using other modes of intervention, specifically other software applications, and with a larger population. Increasing sample size would also allow for subgroup analysis to determine if the interventions were effective for all groups of students. Further studies would be iv beneficial in determining generalizability of these findings and also may help identify other teaching strategies or approaches that make a significant difference in student gains related to multiplication fact fluency. Knowing that multiplication fluency is key to advanced math skills, it is important to provide teachers with intervention tools that are proven effective.","['Peer tutoring', 'Digital technology']",NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10', '11']",NA,5th Grade Students,,6,"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""six elementary schools[¬e]""']",,,6,"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""six elementary schools[¬e]""']",,6,"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""six elementary schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,10,"['Page 70:\n[¬s]""The participants within each classroom were randomly assigned to the computer-aided group, the peer-tutor group or the control group.""\n""ten classrooms[¬e]""']",,10,,"['Page 70:\n[¬s]""The participants within each classroom were randomly assigned to the computer-aided group, the peer-tutor group or the control group.""\n""ten classrooms[¬e]""']",10,"['Page 70:\n[¬s]""ten classrooms (4 fourth grade and 6 fifth grade)[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,Two intervention groups (computer-aided instruction and peer tutoring) were compared with the control group . ,,Random (please specify),"['Page 70:\n[¬s]"" All fourth and fifth grade classes were assigned a number and selection occurred through a computer-generated list of random numbers.""\n""All students in participating classrooms were given a 2-minute timed and written pretest of 100 multiplication facts.

40307530,Somers (2010),2010,"According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), just over 70 percent of students nationally arrive in high school with reading skills that are below ""proficient""--defined as demonstrating competency over challenging subject matter. Of these students, nearly half do not exhibit even partial mastery of the knowledge and skills that are fundamental to proficient work at grade level. These limitations in literacy skills are a major source of course failure, high school dropout, and poor performance in postsecondary education. While research is beginning to emerge about the special needs of striving adolescent readers, very little is known about effective interventions aimed at addressing these needs. To help fill this gap and to provide evidence-based guidance to practitioners, the U.S. Department of Education initiated the Enhanced Reading Opportunities (ERO) study--a demonstration and rigorous evaluation of supplemental literacy programs targeted to ninth-grade students whose reading skills are at least two years below grade level. As part of this demonstration, 34 high schools from 10 school districts implemented one of two reading interventions  Reading Apprenticeship Academic Literacy (RAAL), designed by WestEd, and Xtreme Reading, designed by the University of Kansas Center for Research on Learning. These programs were implemented in the study schools for two school years. The U.S. Department of Education's (ED) Office of Elementary and Secondary Education (OESE) funded the implementation of these programs, and its Institute of Education Sciences (IES) was responsible for oversight of the evaluation. MDRC--a nonprofit, nonpartisan education and social policy research organization--conducted the evaluation in partnership with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and Survey Research Management (SRM). The goal of the reading interventions--which consist of a year-long course that replaces a ninth-grade elective class--is to help striving adolescent readers develop the strategies and routines used by proficient readers, thereby improving their reading skills and ultimately, their academic performance in high school. The first two reports for the study evaluated the programs' impact on the two most proximal outcomes targeted by the interventions--students' reading skills and their reading behaviors at the end of ninth grade. This report--which is the final of three reports for this evaluation--examines the impact of the ERO programs on the more general outcomes that the programs hope to affect--students' academic performance in high school (grade point average [GPA], credit accumulation, and state test scores) as well as students' behavioral outcomes (attendance and disciplinary infractions). These academic and behavioral outcomes are examined during the year in which they were enrolled in the ERO programs (ninth grade), as well as the following school year (tenth grade for most students).

Dylan Wiliam and Siobhan Leahy, who are experts in formative assessment, designed the intervention and associated materials. The Schools, Students and Teachers network (SSAT), an independent membership organisation, delivered the project. Schools received detailed resource packs to run monthly workshops known as Teacher Learning Communities (TLCs). Each TLC was expected to last 75–90 minutes. All teaching staff were involved and split into groups comprising 8–14 people. TLC agendas and materials focused on five key formative assessment strategies  ‘clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions’  ‘engineering effective classroom discussions and activities’  ‘providing feedback that moves learning forward’  ‘activating learners as instructional resources for one another’  and ‘activating learners as owners of their own learning’. Within each of these high-level concepts, the TLC handouts introduced multiple formative assessment techniques for teachers to consider. In-between workshop sessions, teachers were expected to conduct peer lesson observations and provide feedback to each other. Each school appointed a lead teacher who attended an initial training day and received ongoing implementation support from an SSAT Lead Practitioner. This included a mixture of visits, phone calls, e-mails, and access to an online community. The project was a randomised controlled trial. It was an effectiveness trial, which tested whether the intervention worked under everyday conditions in a large number of schools.

For the most part, the program also had positive effects on children's feelings toward school and grades in spelling. Results suggest that youth-serving organizations and schools can collaboratively implement multicomponent interventions that provide protective factors that may buffer high-risk elementary school children from the multiple risks in their lives for future drug abuse. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",['Extending school time'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8', '9']",NA,NA,,5,NA,,,5,NA,,5,"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""The five collaborating ele- ment a r y\nschools served the same children as their local Boys & Girls Club.[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""The five collaborating ele-\nmentary schools served the same children as their local Boys & Girls Club[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""The program was offered\nfor 2 years during children’s second and third grade, and addi-\ncollected in fourth grade.

50307071,Starks (2002),2002,"Many young people leave the education system earlier than they are suppose to. They either drop out of school prior to graduation or graduating but not pursuing a college degree or vocational school. As the government attempts to address this issue, schools and other youth organizations are increasingly turning to alternative interventions to help these young people who are at risk of academic under-achievement and becoming productive members of society. Mentoring programs are one such intervention. The theory behind mentoring is that caring and influential adults can provide youth with a form of social capital that is invaluable to their development. There are few studies done on mentoring that indicate mentoring being an effective way to address some of the academic aspirations of today's youth. This study shows that mentoring can have a significant impact on academic achievement. A review of the literature on at-risk youth is discussed followed by a discussion of the theory and history of mentoring. Findings are presented from the empirical data collected before, during and after the 1999–2000 academic school year. Data used in this study consisted of mentor, student, parent and teacher surveys, student SAT-9 test scores, attendance count and discipline referrals. Using multivariate analysis of variance, analysis of variance and gain score analysis, the findings showed  (1) a significance difference (p < .05) in grade point average for those students who participated in the mentor program (participant group) and a no significant difference in grade point average for those who did not participate in the mentor program (comparison group)  (2) a significant difference (p < .05) in SAT-9 Reading scores for the participant group, compared to the comparison group which had no significant difference of scores  (3) a significant difference (p < .05) in SAT-9 Language scores for the participant group and no significant difference for the comparison group  (4) a significant difference (p < .05) in the attendance rate for the participant group while the comparison group had no significant difference. Although SAT-9 Math scores and discipline referrals increased for both groups, the tests revealed no significant difference.

This study investigated randomly assigned groups of first and fifth-grade students from an urban North Central Texas school district. One group of students at each grade received the cross-age tutoring program. In addition, a smaller group of first-grade students received Reading Recovery. Both groups were pre-tested with the Metropolitan Achievement Test, eighth edition, (MAT8), Terminal Units (T-units), a holistic writing assessment, and Reading and Writing Attitudes Surveys. Pre-tests were used to assign students to groups. The intervention continued from September through March when all groups were given the measurements again as post tests. This study was quantitative with qualitative support. The quantitative data was analyzed with Kruskal Wallis, Mann Whitney, and T-tests to measure differences between groups. The qualitative data was drawn from all participants through field observations, interviews, journals, and lesson plans. The quantitative analysis found significant differences favoring the cross-age tutoring participants at the first-grade level compared to Reading Recovery on the spelling assessment and at the fifth-grade level compared to the control group on a holistic writing assessment.

All instruction was carried out via the computer. The results indicated significant effects of strategy training on the students' ability to identify the main idea in paragraphs about the training content and in paragraphs about new content.

38296685,Styles (2014),2014,"Chatterbooks is an extracurricular reading initiative that aims to increase a child’s motivation to read by providing schools with tools and resources to encourage reading for pleasure. The intervention developed for this trial consisted of nine weekly one hour sessions where the pupils read and discussed an age-appropriate book. The programme was delivered by trained graduates to Year 7 pupils who had not reached a secure Level 4 in English at the end of Key Stage 2. Chatterbooks was developed by the Reading Agency as an extracurricular activity, organised in local libraries on Saturday mornings by volunteers. The sessions are intended for six to twelve-year-olds and attendance is voluntary. For the purposes of this evaluation, the Chatterbooks programme was altered significantly to test its impact in a more structured and formalised school environment. A variation called Chatterbooks Plus was delivered alongside the Chatterbooks programme. In this intervention, fifteen minutes of a sixty minute session were replaced with dialogic reading where children read aloud and were offered explicit prompts. The target population for this evaluation was pupils in secondary schools in an area of the Midlands accessible from Coventry University. The programme was delivered by trained graduates at Coventry University who had received training from the Reading Agency and Professor Clare Wood (for the dialogic reading component). Intervention delivery took place from April to June 2013. Chatterbooks aims to encourage reading for pleasure. It is assumed that this translates into an improvement in reading ability. This evaluation set out to measure what impact the scheme had on reading ability as measured by the GL Assessment New Group Reading Test. The evaluation was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of 23 projects focused on literacy catch-up at the primary-secondary transition. It was one of four programmes funded with a particular focus on reading comprehension. There was no evidence of impact of either Chatterbooks or Chatterbooks Plus on pupils’ reading ability either immediately after the interventions or at a three-month follow-up. The headline findings suggest that Chatterbooks and Chatterbooks Plus had a slightly negative impact on reading ability with effect sizes of -0.14 and -0.01 respectively. However, they are not statistically significant, suggesting that the difference in outcomes between the control and intervention group occurred by chance. Consequently, the effect sizes are indistinguishable from zero. The results for children on free school meals in both interventions should be interpreted in the same way.

37093606,Sutherland (1999),1999,"This study investigated the effects of a structured procedure for collaborative writing (Paired Writing) on the quality of creative writing and attitudes to writing in 8-year-old children. Each of two classes featured an experimental collaborative writing group and a control group, which produced writing individually. In one class the experimental group collaborated in different-ability pairs with fixed roles as helper and writer  in the other class, in same-ability pairs reciprocating roles. The 8 week project involved training for the participating children. Analyses were made of quality of individual writing before and after the project and of collaborative writing during the project. Pre-post gains in individual writing were statistically significant for the cross-ability experimentals but not for their controls. Pre and post scores for same-ability experimentals were not significantly different, nor for their controls. However, the same-ability experimentals improved while their controls deteriorated, and the difference in gain between experimentals and controls was significant. Also, the collaborative writing of same-ability pairs scored significantly higher than their pre-project individual writing, although this was not the case for cross-ability pairs. Both types of Paired Writers reported finding the method easy to use and a majority showed positive attitudes to it. It was concluded that both formats of Paired Writing could be effective. However, ensuring short term gains for the more able helpers in cross-ability pairs could be problematic. Further research is needed, including trials of cross-ability reciprocal role pairing.

This project is an exploratory behavioral intervention program for educationally deprived students and focuses its efforts on the improvement of academic and school oriented behaviors. The tutor component of the project consists of the delivery of academic remedial services through the use of the peer tutoring strategy adopted from the Operation Tutor Project. The buddy component consists of the mediation and advocacy efforts of the project buddies to support and maintain student academic progress. The efforts involve buddy contacts with parents and teachers to create supportive conditions for learning, and the use of positive, nonacademic activities to motivate student learning. The project is successful in reaching its goals and attaining its objectives, and effective in helping the pupils to acquire social and academic behaviors which are essential for success in schools and the community. Academic improvement is shown most clearly in reading and mathematics skills, the tutored subjects. Improvement in attitudes toward the environment is also indicated.

During March, April, and May of the kindergarten year, treatment children participated in an 11-week phoneme awareness intervention that included instruction in letter names and sounds. After the intervention, the treatment children significantly outperformed the control children in phoneme segmentation, letter name and sound knowledge, and reading phonetically regular words and nonwords.

Subjects were 66 average and above-average second-grade students. Data were collected over a seven-day period with instruction and post-testing occurring on alternating days. Data were analyzed in three ways. First, a repeated measures analysis of variance on the pre- and post-test vocabulary scores indicated that statistically significant amounts of learning took place within each instructional group. Second, an analysis of variance was used to assess the effects of these three vocabulary strategies on comprehension. This yielded statistically significant results showing that subjects in the Reconciled Reading Lesson group out performed subjects in either of the other two groups.

Thirty-three children with dyslexia participated and were assigned to one of three groups (a) a novel rhythmic processing intervention designed to highlight auditory rhythmic information in non-speech and speech stimuli  (b) a commercially-available phoneme discrimination intervention  and (c) a no-intervention control. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks. Both interventions yielded equivalent and significant gains on measures of phonological awareness (at both rhyme and phoneme levels), with large effect sizes at the phoneme level. Both programs had medium effect sizes on literacy outcome measures, although gains were non-significant when compared to the controls. The data suggest that rhythmic training has an important role to play in developing the phonological skills that are critical for efficient literacy acquisition.

Fifty students were assigned to an experimental group and fifty students were assigned to a control group A number of pre and post-test measures (the Iowa Test of Basic Skills  the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test  the Social Skills Rating System  and the Self-Perception Profile for children) were used to assess the utility of the peer tutoring initiative across the experimental and control group conditions. At the end of the peer tutoring program, teachers who participated in the experimental groups were asked to respond to a set of open-ended questions to determine the perceived success of the peer tutoring program. The investigation was designed to focus on the following two goals  (a) to document the academic outcomes of the students participating in the peer tutoring program, and (b) to determine the impact of the program on student self-esteem and self-concept. Four research questions were addressed. To what degree does the Time Dollar Tutoring Program affect the achievement levels of the tutors? To what degree does the Time Dollar Tutoring Program affect the achievement levels of the tutees? To what degree does the Time Dollar Tutoring Program affect the social skills' development of the tutors? To what degree does the Time Dollar Tutoring Program affect the social skills' development of the tutees? The three independent variables included group experimental group conditions (experimental X1a and control groups X2a), genders (boys X2a and girls X2b), and grade levels (third grade students—tutees X3a and sixth grade students—tutors X3b). The sixth grade students tutored the third grade students. The six dependent variables included math and reading scores, self-concept scores, scholastic competence scores, cooperation scores, and empathy scores. An analysis of the findings indicated that the tutors (the sixth grade students) and the tutees (the third grade students) made greater gains in reading and math on a national reading test (IOWA) compared to the children who did not participate in the tutoring Program. However, there were no significant differences found in the WIAT reading and math reading scores between the children who participated in the tutoring program and the non-participants. Overall, the teachers rated the students in the experimental third and sixth grade groups more favorably with regard to scholastic competence and social acceptance compared to the control group students. Although there was not a significant group effect found on the measure of cooperation, a further analysis indicated that teachers rated the tutors (the sixth grade group) more favorably in cooperation compared to the other sixth grade students who were in the control group.",['Peer tutoring'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['8', '9', '11', '12']",NA,NA,,9,"['Page 60:\n[¬s]""The data sets for this study were collected from a sample (n=100) drawn from nine elementary schools[¬e]""']",,,9,"['Page 60:\n[¬s]""The data sets for this study were collected from a sample (n=100) drawn from nine elementary schools[¬e]""']",,9,"['Page 60:\n[¬s]""The data sets for this study were collected from a sample (n=100) drawn from nine elementary schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,,2,,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Unclear,NA,"The study states that students were assigned to control or experimental, but not if it was random allocation or not",,Not provided/ not available,NA,"The study states that students were assigned to either control or experimental, but does not explicitly state what the level of assignment was.

37092612,Tomita (2008),2008,"This study explored the effect of formative assessment on student achievement in science. Research in science education has shown that students enter science classrooms with previously formed explanatory models of the natural world  these naive ""mental models"" have a substantial influence on their learning of scientific conceptions (e.g. Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992). In general, conceptual change describes the pathway from pre-instructional or prior conceptions to a post-instructional or desired conception (e.g. Duit, 1999  Posner, Strike, Hewson, & Gertzog  1982). Conceptual change involves a fundamental restructuring of a network of concepts rather than fitting new concepts into an existing conceptual network or structure (National Research Council, 2007). Research has shown that conceptual change is difficult to promote  for example, students may accumulate multiple conceptions over the course of instruction, including both new misconceptions and more scientifically-sound conceptions. Hellden and Solomon (2004) found that although students tended to evoke the same, less-scientific conceptions over time, they could produce more scientifically-sound conceptions during interviews with appropriate prompting  thus, students undergo conceptual accumulation rather than conceptual change. Students can recall scientifically-sound conceptions they have learned and may use them to reason, but they do so in partnership or hybridization with their less-scientific prior conceptions (Vosniadou & Brewer, 1992). Student achievement in science may be conceptualized as composed of four different but overlapping types of knowledge - declarative (knowing that), procedural (knowing how to), schematic (knowing why), and strategic (knowing how knowledge, applies to particular situation and monitoring progress). These four types of knowledge are distinguishable in theory, and may be assessed by different types of measures (Li, 2001  Ayala, Shavelson, Yin, & Schultz, 2002  Shavelson et al, 2008). As such, it is important to identify achievement goals according to different types of knowledge students are expected to gain and to focus instruction and assessment properly - conceptual change focuses on developing increasingly more scientifically-sound schematic knowledge, whereas gains in declarative or procedural knowledge may be more closely related to conceptual accumulation because it does not involve dramatic changes in schematic understanding. Formative assessment, which focuses on providing immediate feedback by acting upon student understanding during the course of instruction, and conceptual change have both been linked to increased student achievement (e.g. Black & Wiliam, 1998  Wang, Haertel & Walberg, 1993). Formative assessment is an instructional strategy that helps teachers to assess students' current understanding, identify the gap between current understanding and expected understanding, and provide immediate and useful feedback to students on how to close the gap. Formative assessment ranges from formal (e.g. embedded, planned-for interactions between teacher and entire class) to informal (e.g. on-the-fly interactions between teacher and class or student). In this study, the links between formative assessment and conceptual accumulation and conceptual change were explored. Specifically, this study asked  (1) Does formative assessment promote conceptual accumulation, and (2) Does formative assessment promote conceptual change? It was hypothesized that conceptual change-focused formative assessment would foster conceptual change, in addition to supporting conceptual accumulation. It was further hypothesized that all students will show gains in conceptual accumulation as indicated by measures of declarative and procedural knowledge, but that students exposed to conceptual change-focused formative assessment would also show gains in conceptual change as indicated by measures of schematic knowledge or mental models. To research the effect of formative assessment on conceptual accumulation and conceptual change, a small randomized experiment involving 102 middle school students was conducted. In Phase I of the study, 52 6th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group  in Phase II of this study, 50 7th graders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Both the control and experimental groups in both phases were taught about sinking and floating by the same teacher (the author) with identical curriculum materials and activities. In addition, the experimental group received three sets of embedded formative assessments focused on conceptual change around the topic of why things sink and float during the course of instruction. In Phase I of this study, both groups were kept at the same pace through the entire sequence of investigations. The control condition spent more time on some of the more critical FAST lessons, gathering additional data to support the theories the curriculum expected they would develop at a particular juncture but not receiving structured experiences aimed at addressing misconceptions. In Phase II, students in the control condition spent roughly the same time on each FAST lesson as those in the experimental condition (e.g. they finished the sequence of activities earlier because they did not have class sessions devoted to the RLs inserted at critical junctures) but participated in the formal assessments as a block of activities after they finished the FAST investigations and posttest measures. In other words, in addition to replicating Phase I, Phase II included a Reflective Lesson section for the control group after the end of the experiment proper, followed by a post-posttest. Overall, it was found that embedding conceptual change-focused formative assessments in the FAST curriculum significantly influenced conceptual change. It was also found that all students experienced significant gains in terms of their conceptual accumulation, regardless of exposure to the formative assessments. This study connected two previously isolated but theoretically linked educational frameworks  conceptual change and formative assessment. It was found that formative assessments can be used to promote conceptual change. It was also found that conceptual change is different than conceptual accumulation, in that students who show gains on measures of declarative and procedural knowledge do not necessarily show gains on measures of schematic knowledge. This implies that if a goal of science instruction is to support student development of scientifically-sound conceptions in addition to acquisition of facts and skills, then conceptual change must be specifically targeted via instructional strategies such as embedded formative assessment.",['Feedback'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,Low ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12', '13']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""This study took place in two phases, involving 102 sixth and seventh graders in a charter school in Hawai‘i,[¬e]""']",,,1,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""This study took place in two phases, involving 102 sixth and seventh graders in a charter school in Hawai‘i,[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""This study took place in two phases, involving 102 sixth and seventh graders in a charter school in Hawai‘i,[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,2,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""This study took place in two phases, involving 102 sixth and seventh graders in a charter school in Hawai[¬e]""']",,2,,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""This study took place in two phases, involving 102 sixth and seventh graders in a charter school in Hawai‘i,[¬e]""']",2,"['Page 30:\n[¬s]""This study took place in two phases, involving 102 sixth and seventh graders in a charter school in Hawai‘i[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 32:\n[¬s]""In both phases, students were assigned to two groups, and the groups randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition, as illustrated in Figure 3.2 below.

40134874,Tomlin (1995) 1_1,1995,"With the increased development of mentoring programs, empirical studies of the association between mentoring and academic outcomes with at-risk adolescent populations are scant. While several studies (Brown, 1990  Hood, 1992  Solomon, 1991) imply that mentor relationships may positively influence achievement, this research seeks to investigate those claims. This study investigates the effects of a mentoring intervention with characteristics of ""will"" (support) and ""skill"" (self-regulation) on variables of self-efficacy, grade point average, teacher conduct ratings, number of unexcused absences, office referrals, suspensions, and self-perception for scholastic competence, social acceptance, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth. Subjects included 55 Black male 6th, 7th, and 8th graders selected from two middle schools by using a multidimensional at-risk rating procedure. Subjects were paired with high achieving Black males from two high schools. Subjects comprised two Treatment Groups and a Wait List Control Group. Groups were similar in terms of age, degree of risk, and intelligence. The treatment for G1 consisted of ""will"" and ""skill"" while the treatment for G2 included only the ""will"" component. For G1 and G2, treatment dyads occurred on eight consecutive weeks with dependent variables measured prior to the first mentoring session and again after the eighth session. A quasi-experimental, partially randomized design was used to provide comparison between treatment groups (G1 and G2) and a wait list control group (G3). Analyses of covariance with pretest scores as the covariates were used to ascertain the significance of hypothesized relationships between dependent and independent variables. Paired t-tests determined the significance of mean changes from pretest to posttest for each of the groups.

43090196,Tomlin (1995) 1_2,1995,"With the increased development of mentoring programs, empirical studies of the association between mentoring and academic outcomes with at-risk adolescent populations are scant. While several studies (Brown, 1990  Hood, 1992  Solomon, 1991) imply that mentor relationships may positively influence achievement, this research seeks to investigate those claims. This study investigates the effects of a mentoring intervention with characteristics of ""will"" (support) and ""skill"" (self-regulation) on variables of self-efficacy, grade point average, teacher conduct ratings, number of unexcused absences, office referrals, suspensions, and self-perception for scholastic competence, social acceptance, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth. Subjects included 55 Black male 6th, 7th, and 8th graders selected from two middle schools by using a multidimensional at-risk rating procedure. Subjects were paired with high achieving Black males from two high schools. Subjects comprised two Treatment Groups and a Wait List Control Group. Groups were similar in terms of age, degree of risk, and intelligence. The treatment for G1 consisted of ""will"" and ""skill"" while the treatment for G2 included only the ""will"" component. For G1 and G2, treatment dyads occurred on eight consecutive weeks with dependent variables measured prior to the first mentoring session and again after the eighth session. A quasi-experimental, partially randomized design was used to provide comparison between treatment groups (G1 and G2) and a wait list control group (G3). Analyses of covariance with pretest scores as the covariates were used to ascertain the significance of hypothesized relationships between dependent and independent variables. Paired t-tests determined the significance of mean changes from pretest to posttest for each of the groups. There was a significant group effect of treatment on variables of self-efficacy, grade point average, and teacher conduct ratings with G1 significantly higher than the Wait List Control Group but no different from G2. Treatment G2 showed a significant mean change in self-efficacy while G1 displayed a significant mean change in grade point average.

37133980,Topping (2004),2004,"Outcomes for methods to accelerate thinking skills involving some peer interaction have been more consistently positive than those for purely teacher-directed or materials-led methods. However, methods involving mainly or only peer interaction are rare. This paper describes and evaluates such a method for peer tutoring in thinking skills, which scaffolds interactive discourse based on a differentiated real book the tutorial pair has chosen to read together. This pilot study aimed to partial the impact on quality of thinking of a peer-tutored thinking intervention from that of a peer-tutored reading intervention, controlling for time on task and amount of peer interactivity. Experimental peer tutees were a whole class (n=28) of seven-year-olds  experimental tutors a whole class (n=31) of 11-year-olds. Comparison tutees were a whole class (n=27) of seven-year-olds  comparison tutors a whole class (n=30) of 11-year-olds. Classes/teachers within the same school were randomly assigned to conditions. In Phase 1, a paired reading intervention was implemented for six weeks for all groups. In Phase 2, the experimental classes of tutors and tutees engaged in the ""paired thinking"" (PT) method for 10 weeks, while the comparison group continued with paired reading. Both treatments involved one 20-minute session weekly. Pre- and post-test assessment of thinking skills and attitude to reading for all participants was conducted and post hoc subjective feedback gathered from participants. The experimental (PT) tutees showed significantly better performance in thinking skills than comparison (PR only) tutees, and some evidence of improved attitudes to reading. However, this was not true for the experimental (PT) tutors. Subjective feedback was very positive from the PT tutees and class teachers, but less positive from the PT tutors. Given the brevity and low cost in time and resources of the treatment, the finding of significant differences in measured thinking skills for the PT tutees is considered encouraging.

In primary schools, these desiderata are difficult to supply through direct teacher instruction, but might be feasible through interactive peer tutoring. This study aimed to evaluate cognitive and affective gains from cross-age peer tutoring for both tutees and tutors in science, using the ""paired science"" programme. For the first time this programme was used to focus on peer rather than parent tutoring and on junior school rather than early years pupils, and for the first time an objective measure of cognitive gain in science was used. Experimental peer tutees were a whole class (n = 32) of seven- to eight-year-olds  tutors a whole class (n = 33) of eight- to nine-year-olds in the same school. A parallel composite class of seven- to nine-year-olds (n = 24) served as controls for tutees and tutors. A peer tutoring paired science intervention was implemented for two 30-minute sessions per week for eight weeks. Video and observational data indicated implementation integrity was satisfactory. Pre- and post-project assessments of understanding of scientific concepts and keywords of a random sample of tutees, tutors and their respective controls (4 × n = 10) were conducted. Additionally, the attitudes of all the tutees, tutors and their teachers towards their experiences were explored by post hoc questionnaire. On pre-post assessments of understanding of scientific concepts and keywords, the experimental group made significant gains while the control group made no gains, yielding effect sizes greater than one, Tutees made greater gains than tutors. The attitudes of the paired scientists and their teachers towards their experiences were generally very positive.

37116207,Topping (2011),2011,"Background  Large-scale randomised controlled trials (RCT) are relatively rare in education. The present study was an attempt to scale up previous small peer tutoring projects, while investing only modestly in continuing professional development for teachers. Purpose  A two-year RCT of peer tutoring in mathematics was undertaken in one local education authority in Scotland. The relative effectiveness of cross-age vs same-age tutoring, light vs intensive intervention, and mathematics vs mathematics + reading tutoring was investigated. Programme description  The intervention was Duolog Math, a freely available tutoring method for working with mathematical problems, involving discussion following eight structured steps and including summarising and generalising at the end. Sample  Eighty-six primary schools in one council in Scotland of average socioeconomic status. Children were of mixed ability and mixed gender, with few ethnic minorities or special needs in relation to background population. Macroevaluation n = 3520. Micro-evaluation Year 1 n = 334, Year 2 n = 447 cf. comparison group n = 85. Design and methods  Almost all the primary schools in the local authority participated and were randomly allocated to condition. A macro-evaluation tested and retested using Performance Indicators in Primary Schools over a two-year period. A micro-evaluation tested and retested within each year using a criterion-referenced test of mathematical problem solving. Macro-evaluation was with multi-level modelling, micro-evaluation with descriptive statistics and effect sizes  ANCOVA and MANOVA. Results  Macro-evaluation yielded significant pre-post gains in mathematics attainment for cross-age tutoring in randomly allocated classes over both years. No other differences were significant. Micro-evaluation yielded pre-post gains for selected schools in Year 1, but no overall gains for randomly allocated schools in Year 2 compared with comparisons. However, Year 2 girls, mathematics-only groups and less able students did gain significantly. Conclusions  Duolog Math tutoring does lead to gains in mathematics attainment compared with students not participating, but only for cross-age tutoring and girls, mathematics-only groups and less able mathematicians. Effectiveness varies according to type of tutoring (cross-age being better) and type of school (selected schools being better), but not intensity of tutoring. The results of the different forms of evaluation were indeed different. © 2011 NFER.",['Peer tutoring'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""Educational Research Vol. 53, No. 1, March 2011, 51–63[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Scotland', 'UK (Select all that apply)']",,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""The intervention involved either 7–8- or 10–11-year-old students or both, so classes involved were determined with no accommodation to teacher preference.[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" The project set out to train teachers in a particular scaﬀolded method to deliver their assigned condition of tutoring.[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""Normally teachers train tutors and tutees in the ﬁrst four relatively easy steps together.

38296692,Torgerson (2014),2014,"The Discover Summer School was a four-week programme which aimed to improve the reading and writing skills of children during the summer between Year 6 and Year 7. The programme was targeted at pupils who had been predicted to achieve below Level 4b in English by the end of Key Stage 2. The programme involved morning workshops focused on writing and poetry delivered by trained teachers, professional authors and poets, and enrichment activities provided in a four-week summer school. Pupils meeting the eligibility criteria for the study, and due to transition from Year 6 to Year 7 in 2013, were recruited through 29 primary schools in proximity to the Discover Children’s Story Centre in Stratford, London in July and August 2013. The study involved 124 pupils from 29 local schools, of whom 76 were randomly selected to attend the summer school  the remaining 48 formed a comparison group. The evaluation was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of 23 projects focused on literacy catch-up at the primary-secondary transition. It was one of two summer school programmes funded, and one of three programmes with a particular focus on writing. The evaluation sought to compare the literacy skills of pupils who attended the summer school with similar pupils who did not attend the summer school. The indicative effect sizes detected were 0.24 in writing and 0.21 in reading. This can be envisaged as saying that pupils who participated in the project made approximately three additional months’ progress compared to similar pupils who did not participate. However, the effect sizes were not statistically significant, which means that the differences between the pupils who attended the summer school and those who did not could have been down to chance. The conclusions which can be drawn from this study are severely limited due to the small number of families who agreed to participate in the trial, and to subsequent problems with testing, detailed further below. The low pupil numbers also meant that it was not possible to conduct a separate analysis of the impact of the programme on students eligible for free school meals. Though the evaluation was primarily focused on measuring attainment, the observations which took place suggested that most children were engaged by and enjoyed the summer school. Staff were supportive and children were encouraged to think creatively about their writing. The interactive approach in poetry sessions in particular appeared to motivate pupils.

It is delivered by the organisation Third Space Learning (TSL). Tutors and pupils communicate using video calling and a secure virtual classroom. Before each session, the pupils’ normal classroom teachers are able to select lessons from Third Space Learning’s maths curriculum to target individual learning issues. In this evaluation, the tutoring sessions took place once a week, at the same time each week. The intervention was targeted at Year 6 pupils who were working at Key Stage 2 level 3 or an insecure KS2 level 4, and was delivered over 27 weeks from September 2014 to May 2015 by Third Space Learning (TSL) in an initial testing phase, with support from Nesta and Nominet Trust. The impact of the intervention was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial design, involving 64 schools and 600 pupils. Schools were randomised to either receive the intervention or deliver 'business as usual’ teaching, which might have involved intensive one to one support for maths. A process evaluation was undertaken to understand the perceptions of teachers and pupils, assess whether the intervention was delivered as intended, and inform any future development of the intervention.

43099934,Torgesen (2006),2006,"Conducted just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the Allegheny Intermediate Unit (AIU), the evaluation is intended to explore the extent to which the four reading programs can affect both the word-level reading skills (phonemic decoding, fluency, accuracy) and reading comprehension of students in grades three and five who were identified as struggling readers by their teachers and by low test scores. Ultimately, it will provide educators with rigorous evidence of what could happen in terms of reading improvement if intensive, small-group reading programs like the ones in this study were introduced in many schools. This study is a large-scale, longitudinal evaluation comprising two main elements. The first element of the evaluation is an impact study of the four interventions. This evaluation report is addressing three broad types of questions related to intervention impacts  • What is the impact of being in any of the four remedial reading interventions, considered as a group, relative to the instruction provided by the schools? What is the impact of being in one of the remedial reading programs that focuses primarily on developing word-level skills, considered as a group, relative to the instruction provided by the schools? What is the impact of being in each of the four particular remedial reading interventions, considered individually, relative to the instruction provided by the schools? • Do the impacts of programs vary across students with different baseline characteristics? • To what extent can the instruction provided in this study close the reading gap and bring struggling readers within the normal range, relative to the instruction provided by their schools? To answer these questions, the impact study was based on a scientifically rigorous design—an experimental design that uses random assignment at two levels  (1) 50 schools from 27 school districts were randomly assigned to one of the four interventions, and (2) within each school, eligible children in grades 3 and 5 were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group. Students assigned to the intervention group (treatment group) were placed by the program providers and local coordinators into instructional groups of three students. Students in the control groups received the same instruction in reading that they would have ordinarily received. Children were defined as eligible if they were identified by their teachers as struggling readers and if they scored at or below the 30th percentile on a word-level reading test and at or above the 5th percentile on a vocabulary test. From an original pool of 1,576 3rd and 5th grade students identified as struggling readers, 1,042 also met the test-score criteria. Of these eligible students, 772 were given permission by their parents to participate in the evaluation. The second element of the evaluation is an implementation study that has two components  (1) an exploration of the similarities and differences in reading instruction offered in the four interventions and (2) a description of the regular instruction that students in the control group received in the absence of the interventions and the regular instruction received by the treatment group beyond the interventions. Test data and other information on students, parents, teachers, classrooms, and schools is being collected several times over a three-year period. Key data collection points pertinent to this summary report include the period just before the interventions began, when baseline information was collected, and the period immediately after the interventions ended, when follow-up data were collected.

Participants in the study underwent orientation sessions as follows  EMR teachers— 1 hour  tutors and controls— 2 1/2 hours  tutees and controls— 1 1/2 hours. Tutors were randomly assigned to a younger partner (tutee) and given a Study Word List comprised of 100 words. The Study Word List served as the tutor*s basic instructional tool. Tutorial sessions lasted IS minutes daily for a period of four weeks* All tutorial sessions were held at approximately the same time each day in a place agreed upon by the EMR teachers and students involved in the study. Using the pretest mean spelling score as the cover iate, the posttest means for each group were analyzed by analysis of covariance technique. Tutor and tutee spelling achievement was significantly greater than the achievement for the corresponding control students. The present study, while equivocal with respect to the precise explanation of the results, is interpreted as offering evidence to support the belief that an EMR pupil's spelling achievement will improve when he is assigned the responsibility of tutoring a younger peer in spelling. The study also supports the belief that an EMR pupil, when tutored in spelling by an older EMR peer, will improve in spelling achievement.

Teacher-made assessments, in particular, have been underutilized for reforming classroom practice. Yet research has shown that staff development that emphasizes teacher collaboration around formative assessment can be effective in changing teaching practices and improving student learning. This study implemented and evaluated a pilot effort for middle school mathematics teachers along these lines called Formative Assessment with Collaborative Teaming and Support (FACTS). The research focused on whether FACTS led to improved student achievement and whether it changed teacher beliefs and practices. Eleven middle school math teachers volunteered to participate, eight using the FACTS intervention and three acting as an outside control group. The study included 31 classroom sections and 843 students. Both quantitative and qualitative data were used in the analysis. Benchmark tests were given to students three times during the first trimester of a school year. Gain scores, covariance analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling were used to measure treatment effects. Second, participating teachers were surveyed at the beginning and end of the intervention to measure changes in their beliefs and practices. Survey results were compared to national outcomes on similar questions, and treatment groups and individual teachers were compared in terms of pre- to post-intervention changes. Finally, qualitative data gathered during collaboration meetings was combined with post-intervention interviews to help verify results and add context to the study. Overall, the findings for the use of the FACTS intervention were mixed. There was no significant difference in student achievement growth across the treatment groups, indicating that FACTS did not significantly impact student learning. Yet changes in teacher beliefs and practices were found, as indicated by positive effect sizes on measures of assessment beliefs and practices, instructional beliefs, instructional practices, data use, and teacher-to-teacher interaction.

The first-year findings revealed that while 21st-Century after-school centers changed where and with whom students spent some of their after-school time and increased parental involvement, they had limited influence on academic performance, no influence on feelings of safety or on the number of latchkey children, and negative influences on behavior. In the middle school centers, homework help sessions were typically organized with students in large groups proctored by teachers or other staff, and homework was not checked for quality or completeness. Middle school participants, averaging attendance of one day per week, were more likely than nonparticipants to report that they sold drugs, smoked marijuana, or had their personal property damaged. Elementary programs reduced the time students spent at home cared for by a parent or sibling but did not reduce self-care. Key implementation findings indicate that grantees had succeeded in implementing their planned programs and in gaining support from and creating working relationships with school principals and teachers. Most programs provided academic, enrichment, and recreation activities, but made limited efforts to plan for sustainability.

39253306,Ugel (1999),1999,"Annual data supplied by the U.S. Department of Education (USDE  1998) show that more than 50% of students being provided special education services have learning disabilities (LD) and that, of these, more than 80% manifest their difficulties in reading, writing, and language. Middle school students with reading disabilities who continue to demonstrate difficulty with reading lack the strategies and skills needed to succeed in textbook-based instruction as compared to their typically achieving peers. The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of a multicomponent reading intervention in improving word identification, fluency, and comprehension for middle school students with reading disabilities. This study employed a quasi-experimental nonequivalent comparison group with pretest/posttest design involving a between-participant factor (Group) and a within-participant factor (Time) (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Twenty-four middle school students enrolled in a reading program that used multicomponent reading instruction (intervention group) and 24 students received no summer school instruction (no-contact comparison group). The treatment lasted for 4 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention reading achievement data were collected on three variables-word identification, fluency, and comprehension—using the Gray Oral Reading Test-Third Edition (GORT-III  Wiederholt & Bryant, 1992) and the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised (WRMT-R  Woodcock, 1987).

Results indicated that in reading arguments, students who received instruction in TASK demonstrated statistically significant improvement. In writing arguments, only those students given TASK in a cooperative learning environment made significant gains in holistic scores when direct comparisons of treatments were made. However, the pre-to-post holistic scores of students in both TASK conditions showed significant gains. In both the reading and writing of arguments, low achieving readers receiving TASK made significantly greater gains than their low achieving counterparts in the control treatment, indicating that facilitators like TASK help students to improve in both the reading and writing of arguments.

40307358,Uttero (1992),1992,"This study developed and evaluated the Instruction-Modeling-Cooperative (I-M-C) engagement instructional model. It has two components  (1) explicit verbal instruction and modeling of five comprehension strategies (charting of prior knowledge, prediction, concept mapping, summarization, and question generation) and (2) the cooperative application of these strategies. In this model, the teacher provides theoretical information about the strategy and then models the method for the students, who then work together in cooperative learning groups to apply the technique to content area material. A prior knowledge test, devised for this experiment, and the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test were administered to 179 fourth and sixth grade students prior to the experiment. The I-M-C students received explicit instruction and modeling in the five comprehension strategies and worked together cooperatively to apply the techniques to the material in their science textbook. Control group students received traditional instruction (lecture, discussion, and completion of workbook/sheet activities). After twelve weeks three posttests, developed for this study, were administered  a cued recall comprehension test, a multiple choice test of science concepts, and a science attitude inventory, as well as the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. An experimental-control group design, with pretests and posttests, was used to test the effects of the independent variables (the I-M-C model, age, reading achievement level, and gender) on the dependent measures (reading comprehension, acquisition of science concepts, and attitude toward science). The study included a 2(treatment) x 2(grade) x 4(age) x 3(reading achievement level) x 2(gender) factorial design. Data were analyzed by employing a series of analyses of variance and analyses of covariance, with scores from the Gates-MacGinitie comprehension subtest and the prior knowledge tests as covariates. Results indicated that the I-M-C model was beneficial for enhancing comprehension, as measured by the cued recall test, acquisition of concepts, and attitude toward learning. It was not effective in improving comprehension as measured by the comprehension subtest of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. The findings suggested that the I-M-C model is effective at promoting comprehension of science material, the acquisition of science concepts, and a positive attitude toward science.","['Reading comprehension strategies', 'Collaborative learning']",NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '9', '11', '12']",NA,NA,,1,NA,,,1,NA,,2,NA,,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,,4,,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, not matched prior to treatment","['Page 74:\n[¬s]"" A one-way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between the two groups in total reading, F (1, 95) = 0.84, p > .05.

37133984,Van Keer (2004),2004,"Background. Research reveals that explicit reading strategies instruction and engaging students in interaction about texts promote students' reading comprehension ability. The present intervention study combines both aspects. Aims. The study examines the educational benefits of explicit reading strategies instruction, followed by practice in (a) teacher-led whole-class activities (STRAT), (b) reciprocal same-age (STRAT + SA), or (c) cross-age peer tutoring activities (STRAT + CA) on fifth graders' reading comprehension achievement. Sample. Twenty-two fifth-grade teachers and their 454 students from 19 different schools throughout Flanders (Belgium) participated. Method. A quasi-experimental pretest post-test retention test design was used with three experimental (STRAT, STRAT + SA, and STRAT + CA) and a matched control group. The experimental interventions were implemented during an entire school year. Results. Multilevel analysis revealed that the STRAT and STRAT + CA condition made a significantly larger pretest to retention test progress than the control group. The significant major progress was especially situated from pretest to post-test, during which the intervention took place. Concerning the STRAT + SA condition no significant differences with regard to the control group were detected.

The experimental intervention was based on findings of (a) early developmental phases in phonological recoding, (b) reciprocal development between phoneme awareness and phonological recoding, and (c) reciprocal development between phonological processing skills and early reading. The instruction was designed to facilitate the gradually expanding use of letter-phoneme relationships in early read- ing and spelling. The results indicated that, at posttest, the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group on the measures of phonolog- ical processing skills and in reading.

Instead, the findings indicate, achieving this outcome will require more comprehensive models including more extensive intervention (e.g., more time, even smaller groups), interventions that are longer in duration (multiple years), and interventions that vary in emphasis based on specific students' needs (e.g., increased focus on comprehension or word study).",['Reading comprehension strategies'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['12', '13', '14']",NA,NA,,6,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""students from six middle schools (two from the Þrst and larger site and four from the second site) participated in the study[¬e]""']",,,6,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""students from six middle schools (two from the Þrst and larger site and four from the second site) participated in the study[¬e]""']",,6,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""students from six middle schools (two from the Þrst and larger site and four from the second site) participated in the study.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],NA,,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],NA,"There were three arms in this study (incl. small group intervention approach).

In the present study the authors employed an innovative distance technology model to deliver professional development and real-time collaborative coaching to isolated rural schools. Each experimental classroom received a laptop, webcam, and webconferencing software. This technology was used with each experimental teacher so that the authors could see and hear her working with each of her struggling readers in real time and she could see and hear the literacy consultants at their university thousands of miles away. Through this technology the literacy consultants could coach the classroom teacher in using the TRI strategies and also use the technology of grade level meetings and workshops throughout the year. Findings of this study suggests that the Targeted Reading Intervention, using webcam technology with classroom teachers in kindergarten and first grade, can significantly help struggling readers progress more quickly in all of the basic word reading and comprehension skills over one year. In addition, for the basic word reading skills, the TRI can actually help struggling readers catch up with their non-struggling peers in the same classroom by the end of the school year.

TuinLEC adopts the reading literacy theoretical framework of PISA (Program for International Students Assessment, OECD, 2009). TuinLEC includes eight lessons distributed in two phases, one for modeling and guided practice, and the second for independent practice. TuinLEC interacts with every student and it provides help and feedback for the task in a game-like environment. Half of the students were taught with TuinLEC, whereas the other half served as the control group. Children in both groups were paired according to reading comprehension scores. We measured students’ reading literacy skills after intervention, which showed that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group. Students who were taught with TuinLEC were also given a questionnaire measuring satisfaction, usability, and self-efficacy  TuinLEC scored positively in all these measurements.

The subjects for the experiment were 16 middle-school students identified as needing help to improve their performance in academic subjects. These students were enrolled in a voluntary four-week summer school class taught by three teachers trained to use a program which provided explicit instruction in comprehension monitoring and fostering strategies, fix-up strategies, and think-aloud techniques. Pre- and posttreatment assessments were done of the students' reading comprehension skills and self-perceptions of scholastic competence. Three months after the treatment ended, the students' self-perceptions of scholastic competence again were measured. Students' English grades before and after the treatment were compared. A control group of 16 students also received four weeks of voluntary summer school instruction in reading comprehension and study skills. Their teachers, however, did not provide instruction in reading strategies. The control group took the same pre- and posttests as the experimental group. ANCOVA was computed for posttreatment reading comprehension, self-perceptions, and English grades. Pretreatment scores were used as covariates. Finally, the correlation was computed between gains in self-perceptions and gains in reading comprehension. ANCOVA found that, following the treatment, the experimental students had higher self-perceptions of scholastic competence and higher reading comprehension scores. No correlation was found between gains in self-perceptions of scholastic competence and gains in reading comprehension. The differences in self-perceptions of scholastic competence did not remain after three months. Furthermore, no differences were found in English grades between the experimental and control groups after three months. This study has limitations with regard to the age, the achievement level, and the size of the sample studied. No information was collected on the actual activities of the students. Another limitation is the brevity of the treatment period.

A collaboration of public and private funders, SFBI operates comprehensive after-school programs in six middle schools, one elementary school and one high school. Public/Private Ventures' (P/PV's) evaluation found that SFBI programs consisted of high quality after-school activities, provided young people with important developmental experiences (such as adult support) and prevented declines in school effort (typical among middle school youth). Although the initiative did not explicitly set out to improve young people's academic outcomes, these were also examined. Despite the high quality of the centers' developmental programs, participants showed no academic gains, and the authors conclude that positive developmental experiences are not sufficient for ensuring academic success among youth who are already struggling in school. This report contains nine chapters, structured according to the theory of change. Following an introduction, Chapter 2 describes the theory of change in more detail. Chapter 3 describes the initiative as a whole, and Chapter 4 describes the centers and asks whether or not they achieved key early outcomes. Chapters 5 through 8 are the heart of this report. Chapter 5 examines the quality of the programming at the centers and the organizational and staff practices that contributed to high-quality programs. Chapter 6 analyzes youth participation at the centers. It also examines center and programmatic characteristics that might be linked to participation. Chapters 7 and 8 look at young people's outcomes. Chapter 7 examines the developmental experiences that young people had at the centers and whether or not those experiences can be linked to participation. Chapter 8 examines long-term outcomes--competency development, social well-being and school success. Chapter 9, the conclusion, reflects on the implications that the findings have for the after-school field.

All students were expected to be reading on grade level or higher by the end of third grade. A higher degree of success would be expected from all elementary principals. The curriculum leaders and elementary school principals in the Pearland Independent School District developed the Second Grade Summer School Program to assist at-risk second grade students in achieving success in reading before they reached third grade. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the Pearland Independent School District's Second Grade Summer School Program on the reading achievement of at-risk second grade students.

DPE refers to a developmental intervention that incorporates peer tutoring to promote the academic achievement and psychological development of youth. Specifically, the purpose of the study was to examine the effectiveness of the deliberate psychological education model at increasing the mathematics achievement, academic efficacy, and cognitive development of adolescents at-risk of dropping out of school. The DPE intervention training took place once a week for approximately 60 to 85 minutes, for nine weeks when the eighth-grade tutors met as a group with the researcher during their enrichment class period. The tutors received training about the following topics  orientation to tutoring/principles of tutoring, communication skills, helping behaviors, record keeping procedures, behavior management and journal keeping skills. In addition, the tutors received training that focused on mathematics strategies and activities. Then, the tutors met with their tutees for mathematics tutoring for approximately 45 minutes during the students' regularly scheduled enrichment class. The tutoring sessions occurred once a week for seven weeks. The results indicated that the DPE intervention is effective at promoting mathematics achievement and academic efficacy in the tutees at-risk of dropping out of school. In fact, the effect size for these results revealed that 51% of the variance in the academic efficacy and mathematics achievement was attributable to the treatment effect between the tutees and non-tutees. At the eighth-grade level, the DPE intervention was effective at promoting the mathematics achievement of the tutors. The effect size for this result (.15) revealed that there was a bigger difference in mathematics achievement for the experimental group than the control group, after controlling for initial levels of academic efficacy.

At 13 schools (control condition) pupils did spelling exercises as usual, i.e. individually. At 14 schools pupils worked in pairs  each pupil was asked to check a partners' work and discuss mistakes. At grade 2 cooperation led to less off-task behaviour when pupils did spelling assignments of a more complex type. Nevertheless we found a negative effect on achievement. At grade 4 cooperation led to less off-task behaviour for complex assignments and an increase in pupil's effort as rated by their teachers as well. These findings were accompanied by a weak effect on achievement. Cooperation did not affect effort nor achievement of pupils from grade 6. At none of three grade levels we found indications of better reasoning strategies as a consequence of pair learning.

The intervention group used the intelligent web-based tutoring system for the structure strategy (ITSS) for 30 to 45 min each week as a partial substitute for the language arts curriculum for the entire school year. The structure strategy teaches students how to read and comprehend expository texts by identifying the text structure and creating strategic mental representations of the text. The web-based tutoring system delivered the structure strategy training with modeling, practice tasks, assessment, and feedback. The control classrooms used the school's language arts curriculum for the full language-arts time.

43099780,Wilson (1998),1998,"The purpose of this study was to determine if there were significant differences in word recognition skills depending on whether students were instructed in a WL or a PSB classroom. With the exception of the cloze activity no significant mean differences were found. Cloze activities are used in the WL classrooms as an explicit instructional tool but not in the PSB classrooms. Therefore, the significant findings for this variable may reflect the effect specific instructional techniques have on students' performance. Cloze activities in part reflect the ability of readers to use prediction as they read. Thus, although word recognition was a part of this task, so was prediction, and students from the WL classrooms demonstrated significantly better prediction abilities. There were no other converging findings indicating that differences in instructional practice produced differences in the type of information used in word recognition. The major purpose of the study was to determine whether students from WL classrooms would differ in word recognition abilities compared with those from PSB classrooms. The results suggest that few overall differences existed. Students taught in a program focused on using contextual information (WL) performed significantly better on only one task measuring use of this information for word identification than students taught in a program that focused on graphic information (PSB). As well, students taught in the PSB approach did not use graphic information significantly more for word identification than students taught in a WL approach. In terms of word identification, the performance of the two groups was more similar than different. Alternatively, there is also evidence that indicates teachers adjust their reading programs and integrate aspects of each approach. [Stanovich, K.E.] (1994) stated that teachers are pragmatists and that they teach what works. By its nature pragmatism opposes rigidity in philosophical orientation and allows flexibility in teachers' choices of instructional tools. This observation is consistent with the findings of [Pressley] and [Rankin] (1994) where the WL teachers in their sample incorporated a number of teaching practices that included the direct instruction of letter-sound correspondences. Although the WL teachers indicated that they generally taught discrete skills in the context of continuous text, they also taught discrete skills in isolation, especially for weak readers. The converse was also true where supporters of direct phonic instruction used context as a vehicle for the teaching of specific phonetic strategies (Pressley & Rankin, 1994). Similarities in classroom practices were also noted by [Sacks] and Mergendoller (1997) in their examination of the relationship between a teacher's theoretical approach and student achievement. They found many similarities between WL and PSB classrooms, including type of classroom activities and time spent involved in various activities, although they did note that ""there were subtle, and meaningful differences in the classroom literacy experiences of students"" (p. 734).",['Phonics'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['Canada'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8']",NA,NA,,4,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools:[¬e]""']",,,4,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools:[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,5,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms[¬e]""']",,5,,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms[¬e]""']",5,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,"There were two groups, neither were labelled as control however.",,Retrospective Quasi Experimental Design (QED),"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools: three where the teachers followed a WL, literature-based\napproach and two where the teachers used a PSB, sequential approach to instruction[¬e]""']",NA,,Class,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Grade 2 teachers were asked to identify their approach to reading instruction.""\n""Five classrooms were chosen from four schools: three where the teachers followed a WL, literature-based\napproach and two where the teachers used a PSB, sequential approach to instruction.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Retrospective QED  '],"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""ive classrooms were chosen from four schools: three where the teachers followed a WL, literature-based approach and two where the teachers used a PSB, sequential approach to instruction.""\n""A quasi experimental design was chosen\nfor this study.""\n""Grade 2 teachers were asked to identify their approach to reading instruction.

Pupils (N=112) were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control group. The training was tailored to the Swedish transparent orthography and designed for one-to-one-tutoring during twelve weeks. Previously, reading speed has been shown to be hard to remediate, and one important purpose was to improve reading speed by explicit training. The intervention group showed improvements immediately after intervention in spelling, reading comprehension, reading speed, and phoneme awareness. There were also significant indirect effects from intervention to all variables one year later. Reading comprehension at immediate post-test predicted spelling one year later, and phoneme awareness at post-test predicted both spelling and reading comprehension one year later. The results suggest the importance of a multi-component intervention, even in transparent orthographies, which includes phonics combined with comprehension strategies and fluency training.

50752693,Woo (2005),2005,"Although the debate on best practices in literacy instruction continues, there is evidence to support the effectiveness of one-on-one tutoring for those students at risk for reading failure. Guided by these findings, the America Reads Challenge Act was passed to address the issue of ensuring that every child read independently by fourth grade. One important aspect of the Act was the utilization of volunteers to serve as literacy tutors for children in Grades K-3. The purpose of this study was to compare the achievement in reading and writing of two groups of students at those four grade levels. The two groups consisted of those tutored by federal work-study students in an America Reads Tutoring Program and those not being tutored. In addition, an assessment was made of the impact of participating in the program on the attitudes of the teachers, tutors, and students. Pre- and post-tests to determine literacy achievement included an oral story retelling and a probed comprehension test at all grade levels. The Second and Third Grade children were also given a written retelling test. An inventory for concepts about print and a test to determine stage of writing development were administered in Kindergarten and First Grade. Teachers, tutors and children were interviewed to determine their attitudes toward the program. The study took place in a Professional Development School with teachers who were experienced in teaching grades K-3. Equal numbers of boys and girls (a total of 80) were randomly assigned to the treatment or the control group. Tutors were selected from the pool of Federal WorkStudy applicants based on their experience and interest in working with young struggling readers.

38296699,Worth (2018),2018,"GraphoGame Rime is a computer game designed to teach pupils to read by developing their phonological awareness and phonic skills. Originally developed by a Finnish University, the program underpinning the game can analyse performance and constantly adjust the difficulty of the game content to match the learner’s ability. The English version of GraphoGame Rime was developed to implement the ‘rhyme analogy’ research by educational neuroscientist Usha Goswami, based at the University of Cambridge. The intervention aimed to improve the reading ability of a group of pupils who were identified as having low literacy skills, as measured by the phonics screening check taken at the end of Year 1. The intervention was delivered by teachers and teaching assistants. Training, technical support and some delivery support was provided by researchers from the University of Cambridge. This study was an efficacy trial of the GraphoGame Rime intervention, carried out during one spring term with 398 Year 2 pupils in 15 primary schools in Cambridgeshire. It was a pupil-randomised controlled trial designed to determine the impact of the intervention on the pupils’ reading attainment and was conducted with two cohorts of pupils over two years. The primary outcome was the raw score on the New Group Reading Test, administered by NFER test administrators within a month of the intervention ending, and provided by GL Assessment. A process evaluation used case-study visits, telephone interviews and analysis of data on pupils’ usage of the game to capture the perceptions and experiences of participating teaching staff and pupils. The intervention was implemented in schools during the 2015/16 and 2016/17 academic years. GraphoGame Rime was funded as part of the Education and Neuroscience scheme, a collaboration between EEF and Wellcome Trust to provide funding for collaborative projects between educators and neuroscientists.","['Digital technology', 'Phonics']",NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7']",NA,NA,,15,"['Page 21:\n[¬s]""15 primary schools[¬e]""']",,,15,"['Page 21:\n[¬s]""15 primary schools[¬e]""']",,15,"['Page 21:\n[¬s]""15 primary schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,53,"['Page 20:\n[¬s]""Randomised (class n=53[¬e]""']",,53,,"['Page 20:\n[¬s]""Randomised (class n=53[¬e]""']",53,"['Page 20:\n[¬s]""Randomised (class n=53;[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 11:\n[¬s]""The evaluation design was a pupil-randomised controlled trial with two arms: a group of pupils that spend 10-15 minutes each day playing GraphoGame Rime computer games during literacy lessons and a \x91business as usual\x92 control group of pupils from the same classes who will have business-as- usual tuition in literacy lessons.""\n""The randomisation was stratified by class so that the number of pupils that were in the intervention and control groups, respectively, were known by teachers long in advance, while the identity of the pupils that are allocated to each group was not revealed until after the pre-testing had been completed to prevent any bias.[¬e]""', 'Page 13:\n[¬s]""Each eligible pupil who had completed a pre-test was allocated to either the intervention or control group.

Initial referrals were solicited from teachers by asking them to nominate children they considered to be: (1) capable, but performing well below grade level in reading, and to have (2) persistent classroom behavior problems or chronic inatten- tiveness. To aid them in systematically applying the second referral criterion, teachers rated each chfld referred using the Walker Problem Behavior Identification Checklist (Walker, 1970). From the population of second and third grade children meeting the selection criteria, ten were randomly assigned to the time-on-task classroom while ten others were so assigned to a comparison group.

37116218,Yang (2016),2016,"This study examined how to foster pupils mathematical communication abilities by using tablet PCs. Students were encouraged to generate math creations (including mathematical representation, solution, and solution explanation of word problems) as their teaching materials and reciprocally tutor classmates to increase opportunities for mathematical communication during a semester. A reciprocal peer-tutoring-enhanced mathematical communication system was designed for supporting students math creations and reciprocal peer-tutoring activities. An experiment involving 51 second-graders was conducted to evaluate their improvement in mathematical communication abilities. While the control group received one-to-one self-learning mathematical materials and teacher-led instruction, the experimental group was engaged in computer-supported reciprocal peer tutoring in the same environment with the same materials. Both groups were evaluated by using a mathematical communication ability assessment. The result indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group in the assessment. Additionally, math creations were analyzed for assessing students  formative development. The results showed that students math creations became clearer and more efficient. In other words, their mathematical representations and solution explanations became more accurate after the learning activity.

37133992,Yarrow (2001),2001,"Background. The structured system for peer assisted learning in writing named Paired Writing (Topping, 1995) incorporates both metacognitive prompting and scaffolding for the interactive process. Aim. This study sought to evaluate the relative contribution of these two components to student gain in quality of writing and attitudes to writing, while controlling for amount of writing practice and teacher effects. Sample. Participants were 28 ten- and eleven-year-old students forming a problematic mixed ability class. Methods. All received training in Paired Writing and its inherent metacognitive prompting. Students matched by gender and pre-test writing scores were assigned randomly to Interaction or No Interaction conditions. In the Interaction condition, the more able writers became 'tutors' for the less able. In the No Interaction condition, the more able writers acted as controls for the tutors and the less able as controls for the tutees. Over six weeks, the paired writers produced five pieces of personal writing collaboratively, while children in the No Interaction condition did so alone. Results. On pre- and post-project analyses of the quality of individual writing, all groups showed statistically significant improvements in writing. However, the pre-post gains of the children who wrote interactively were significantly greater than those of the lone writers. There was some evidence that the paired writers also had more positive self-esteem as writers. Conclusion.

37092616,Yin (2005),2005,"This study connected research on formative assessment, motivation, and conceptual change. In particular, it examined three research questions  (1) Can formative assessment improve students' motivational beliefs? (2) Can formative assessment improve students' achievement in science and bring about conceptual change? and (3) Are students' science achievement and conceptual change correlated with their motivational beliefs? Formative assessment in this study refers to assessments embedded in an inquiry-based curriculum. To answer those questions, a randomized experiment was conducted. One thousand and two 6th or 7th graders of 12 teachers in 12 different schools in six states participated in the study. The 12 teachers were matched in pairs and randomly assigned to the experimental and control group. The experimental group employed embedded formative assessments while teaching a science curriculum unit and the control group taught the same unit without formative assessments. All the students were given a motivation survey and one or more achievement tests at pre- and posttest. By comparing the experimental and control students' motivation and achievement scores at pretest and posttest, I examined whether the formative assessment treatment affected students' motivation, learning, and conceptual change. By correlating students' posttest motivation, achievement as well as conceptual change scores, I examined whether students' motivation was related to their achievement and conceptual change. Analyses indicated that, the embedded assessments used by the experimental group did not significantly influence students' motivation, achievement, or conceptual change compared to students in the control group. Most motivation beliefs were correlated with students' achievement in a way similar to what has been reported in the literature. They were not correlated with students' conceptual change scores as hypothesized. Teachers, as well as some contextual factors associated with teachers, were extremely influential on students' motivation, achievement, and conceptual change  teacher effects overshadowed the treatment effect. This study revealed many of the challenges and problems teachers, researchers and randomized experiments are likely to encounter. It also highlighted the difficulty and importance of high-fidelity formative assessment implementation.

40117237,Zief (2005),2005,"The amount of after-school programming in the United States has grown tremendously in the last decade as increasing numbers of working parents require supervision for their children. Furthermore, mounting research correlates unsupervised time with negative outcomes for youth. After-school programs have been promoted as a means to provide supervision, reduce negative outcomes, and promote positive experiences and improved academic outcomes for youth, especially those in low-income, poorly performing schools. Yet large investments in programming have occurred before research has documented program impacts and explained how programs could be better designed or implemented to meet their goals (Zief & Lauver, in press). This mixed-methods study contributes to the limited knowledge base on after-school programming. The experimental-design impact evaluation measures whether an elementary after-school program in an urban school changes student supervision  engages youth in activities  improves student academic, behavioral, and social and emotional outcomes  and alters parental outcomes. The study sample includes 104 youth who applied to the after-school program and were then randomly assigned to either the program or control group. The qualitative component of this study contextualizes the impact findings and investigates stakeholder responses after the long-standing, school-based program of study unexpectedly ended. While this study measured 35 outcomes from multiple sources, few significant outcomes were found. After 1 year of program enrollment, program youth watched television and spent time with friends in the neighborhood less frequently and saw a tutor more frequently than control youth during the after-school hours. After the program was no longer available, program youth and their parents were then more concerned about their safety than were their control counterparts, yet the majority of program parents did not report a negative impact from the loss of programming. The qualitative analysis focuses on understanding students' unenthusiastic response to the program and reasons the enacted program differed from what was planned.

The estimation of regression discontinuity models uncovered evidence of a local average treatment effect. At the cutscore for program admission, participating students had estimated summer oral reading fluency gains approximately 0.40 SD larger than those of nonparticipants. Further examination of the literacy outcomes among the sample of cutscore eligible students revealed that struggling readers who participated in the summer program increased their level of reading fluency relative to struggling readers who declined an invitation to participate. However, the advantage gained by cutscore eligible participants was not sustained over the subsequent academic year.

39253396,Zvoch (2013),2013,"This field-based randomized trial examined the effect of assignment to and participation in summer school for two moderately at-risk samples of struggling readers. Application of multiple regression models to difference scores capturing the change in summer reading fluency revealed that kindergarten students randomly assigned to summer school outperformed their control group peers by .60 of a standard deviation in an intent-to-treat analysis. For the first grade sample, the intent-to-treat estimate was over three quarters of a standard deviation. The contrast in performance was greater when the comparison was focused more specifically on the change in literacy between treatment participants (i.e., randomly assigned students who actually attended summer school) and students randomly assigned to the control group and in analyses that explicitly adjusted for non-compliance with treatment assignment. These results support the experiential intuition of school district personnel regarding the benefits of summer school and suggest that targeted summer instruction can be a useful strategy to support student learning over the summer months.
