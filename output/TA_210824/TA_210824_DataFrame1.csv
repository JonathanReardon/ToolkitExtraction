37671594,Bennett (2013),2013,"This study evaluated the impact of a computerized visuospatial memory training intervention on the memory and behavioral skills of children with Down syndrome. Teaching assistants were trained to support the delivery of a computerized intervention program to individual children over a 10-16 week period in school. Twenty-one children aged 7-12 years with Down syndrome were randomly allocated to either an intervention or waiting list control group. Following training, performance on trained and non-trained visuospatial short-term memory tasks was significantly enhanced for children in the intervention group. This improvement was sustained four months later. These results suggest that computerized visuospatial memory training in a school setting is both feasible and effective for children with Down syndrome.

Pupils are supervised by a tutor, most commonly a teaching assistant.

There was no evidence that the presence of TAs, or any characteristic of TAs, had a measurable effect on pupil attainment. However, results were clear in showing that TAs had an indirect effect on teaching, e.g. pupils had a more active form of interaction with the teacher and there was more individualised teacher attention. This supported teachers' views that TAs are effective in supporting them in this way. The authors conclude that more attention needs to be paid to what they call the pedagogical role of TAs so that they can be used effectively to help teachers and pupils, particularly in the context of the enhanced roles for TAs being introduced as part of the Government's remodelling agenda.

The study used a naturalistic quasi-experimental design, in which teachers were asked to record details of their children and interventions without altering their professional decisions, which has not been used before in investigating literacy difficulties in context. ALS was marginally more effective than other interventions in the majority of classes, but was clearly superior in value for money terms. Children's qualities did not appear to affect outcomes.

Methods  Teaching assistants (TAs) were trained to deliver a reading and language intervention to children in individual daily 40-min sessions. We used a waiting list control design, in which half the sample received the intervention immediately, whereas the remaining children received the treatment after a 20-week delay. Fifty-seven children with Down syndrome in mainstream primary schools in two UK locations (Yorkshire and Hampshire) were randomly allocated to intervention (40 weeks of intervention) and waiting control (20 weeks of intervention) groups. Assessments were conducted at three time points  pre-intervention, after 20 weeks of intervention, and after 40 weeks of intervention. Results  After 20 weeks of intervention, the intervention group showed significantly greater progress than the waiting control group on measures of single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme blending and taught expressive vocabulary. Effects did not transfer to other skills (nonword reading, spelling, standardised expressive and receptive vocabulary, expressive information and grammar). After 40 weeks of intervention, the intervention group remained numerically ahead of the control group on most key outcome measures  but these differences were not significant. Children who were younger, attended more intervention sessions, and had better initial receptive language skills made greater progress during the course of the intervention.

37671598,Cole (2009),2009,"Billions of dollars are spent annually in response to widespread underachievement in areas of math and reading (National Assessment of Education Progress, 2003). Efficacy of these remedial academic programs is often poorly documented and few programs are designed to address individual needs (Kahne, Nagaoka, Brown, O'Brien, Quinn, & Thiede, 2001  Granger, Durlak, Yohalem, & Reisner, 2007). Furthermore, many students do not benefit from these programs due to behavior deficits that impact learning (Granger et al., 2007). The Challenging Horizons Program (CHP) is an evidence-based after-school program that provides an effective framework for engaging students with behavior deficits in learning activities (Langberg, Smith, Bogle, Schmidt, Cole, & Pender, 2006). At the start of this dissertation, the CHP did not have a curriculum targeting students' math performance. This dissertation describes the development of a remedial math intervention delivered within the Challenging Horizons Program designed to be delivered by paraprofessionals with limited training in teaching. To evaluate the curriculum, participants were randomly assigned to either receive the CHP as usual (N = 13) or the CHP plus math intervention 4 days a week (N=13). Outcomes were measured using brief timed assessments of basic math calculation and word problem solving, which showed generally positive effect sizes but low rates of reliable change on a case-by-case basis.

37671620,Cooper (2016) TA,2016,"This study presents an exploratory evaluation of a seven week cross-age peer-tutoring mathematics intervention, Paired Maths (based on Topping, Kearney, McGee and Pugh, 2004), as delivered in a UK secondary school. The impact of Paired Maths on the mathematics attainment of tutees, and the self-esteem of both tutees and tutors is evaluated. Paired Maths involves pairs of students, one student in the role of a tutor and one in the role of a tutee, completing mathematics activities together. Tutors are trained to follow a structured process to scaffold their tutee's learning during the activities. Although existing theory and literature suggests that a cross-age, peer-tutoring intervention around mathematics could have a positive impact, no research has experimentally evaluated Paired Maths in the UK secondary school to date. A total of 78 participants, aged 12-15 years, from three secondary schools situated in a small city in England took part. A Randomised Control Trial was used to consider the impact for Year 8 participants in the role of the Tutee. This compared children randomly assigned to either a Paired Maths (Experimental) Group, a Teaching Assistant Led Comparison Group or a Waitlist Control Group. Results showed no statistically significant differences between groups in mathematics attainment or self-esteem. Within the same exploratory evaluation, a Randomised Control Trial was also employed to consider the impact for the Year 10 students in the role of the tutor. This compared children randomly assigned to either the Paired Maths (Experimental) group or a Waitlist Control Group. Although Waitlist Control participants saw a statistically significant decrease on measures of Maths self-concept over time, results showed no other statistically significant differences between groups in self-esteem. Overall, Paired Maths was not considered to have had a positive impact on mathematics attainment for children in the role of the tutee, or on the self-esteem of children either in the role of tutee or tutor. These findings are considered in relation to the literature and methodology adopted, with a number of possible explanations presented. Possible avenues for future research are proposed (within and also beyond the post-positivist paradigm) with the key conclusion that further exploration is needed around what may support the successful implementation of a Paired Maths programme with secondary aged Pupils. Key limitations of the research relate to the measurement of the dependent variables and treatment fidelity.

37671548,Dockrell (2015),2015,"""Talk for Writing"" is an approach to teaching writing that emphasizes three teaching methods  (1) 'imitation' (where pupils learn texts by heart, so they can discuss and dissect them)  (2) 'innovation' (where pupils adapt stories to create their own versions)  and (3) 'invention' (where teachers help pupils to create original stories). These tasks aim to improve writing ability by giving pupils an understanding of the structure and elements of written language. This project sought to develop ""Talk for Writing"" into a whole-school programme. The pilot programme ran for 18 months, from January 2013 to July 2014, and involved ten schools in Portsmouth. It included a series of 6 full days for school leadership teams (project teams) plus three whole school conferences (""Big Days"") to train teachers and teaching assistants. It covered all primary age groups from nursery to year 6. In addition to the training and support for schools, the programme provided materials, resources, and guidance for staff development, planning and progression. Each school appointed a ""literacy lead"", who was responsible for implementing the programme. This developmental pilot was subject to an evaluation, which had three aims  (1) to appraise the research literature underpinning key dimensions of the ""Talk for Writing"" pedagogy  (2) to evaluate the promise and feasibility of the programme, and provide formative recommendations to inform future evaluation and development  and (3) to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the potential impact of the programme on writing skills that could be used to inform any future trial. The evaluation took place over twelve months and involved six of the 10 intervention schools, one of which withdrew halfway through the programme following the appointment of a new headteacher, and three comparison schools. There were two comparison schools in Portsmouth and one in London. Key conclusions of the project were  (1) most of the teachers were enthusiastic about implementing Talk for Writing within a whole school approach and felt that it provided a consistent approach to teaching writing. However, one school was withdrawn from the project by a new headteacher  (2) features of the programme were embedded in the classrooms, and teachers generally found the programme straightforward to implement  (3) the project displayed mixed evidence of promise. Teachers reported that it had an impact on pupils' writing skills. However, the literature review found mixed support from the current research base for the principles underlying the programme  (4) further research is required to securely estimate the impact of the approach on academic attainment. It would be valuable to undertake some additional development work to refine the approach before it undergoes a full trial  and (5) other research suggests that oral language may play a stronger role in supporting writing in the early years than in Key Stage 2. The programme might benefit from targeted support of key oral language competencies to support the production of early written text in struggling writers and those with weaker oral language skills.

By contrast, much lower proportions of each of the various control groups studied were found to perform this well. Since the readiness scores for the Chicago experimental group reported in M.A. Wallach and L.

While both experimental samples were found to perform considerably better than their respective controls, the Roanoke Rapids experimentals turn out if anything to be superior on these Spache tests to the Chicago experimentals as well. The results of the present study thus replicate and extend the findings reported in 1976.

Methods This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a reading and language intervention for 6‐year‐old children identified by research criteria as being at risk of dyslexia (n = 56), and their school‐identified peers (n = 89). An Experimental group received two 9‐week blocks of daily intervention delivered by trained teaching assistants  the Control group received 9 weeks of typical classroom instruction, followed by 9 weeks of intervention. Results Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses, small‐to‐moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. However, these were fragile and short lived, and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word‐level reading. Conclusions This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions, yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation.

Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by nursery staff and teaching assistants trained and supported by the research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6-month delay. Results  Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness.

Effects were measured using standardized measures of phonological awareness, letter-word identification and word attack skills. The procedure for this study consisted of three phases including a screening phase designed to identify participants for the study, an in-service training for teaching assistants who implemented the treatment intervention, and the intervention implementation. Sixty-three participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control conditions. The performance of the treatment group and the control group was compared. The treatment condition consisted of a 10-minute, one-to-one intervention that included the recommended components of curriculum design for students who are at risk for learning and systematically addressed letter-sound correspondences, blending, segmenting, and the use of onset rimes. The control condition was a traditional, supplemental intervention for students at risk for learning to read. A two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to examine the data and to test for differences within groups and between groups on conceptually similar measures. The amount of change from pretest to posttest was significant for both groups in letter-word identification with a modest effect size of .77 for the control group and a very large effect size of 1.62 for the experimental group. The amount of change from pretest to posttest was also significant for both groups in word attack with a modest effect size of .68 for the control condition and a more robust effect size of 1.58 for the experimental condition. The amount of change from pretest to posttest in phonological awareness was significant for both groups, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. The results of this study indicate that a one-to-one phonological awareness intervention can improve word reading ability and selected word attack skills of first grade students identified as at risk to a greater extent than a traditional, supplemental intervention in a balanced literacy program.

38296617,Gorard (2014),2014,"Switch-on Reading is an intensive 10-week literacy intervention. It is delivered on a one to one basis by staff, most commonly teaching assistants, who have been trained in the approach. The purpose of Switch-on is to achieve functional literacy for as many pupils as possible, and so to close the reading achievement gap for vulnerable children working below age-expected levels. It is inspired by the well- established intervention Reading Recovery, which is teacher led and delivered over a 12-20 week period. In this evaluation, the programme involved regular sessions for pupils who had not achieved Level 4 English at Key Stage 2. The identified pupils in Year 7 attended regular 20-minute reading sessions over the course of the Spring term. The students were removed from class to attend the sessions, which aimed to improve their reading comprehension and fluency. Each session required students to read from four different books graded on the basis of their difficulty. Training and support for staff was provided by the Every Child a Reader staff of Nottinghamshire Local Authority. The overall result was an effect size of +0.24, based on the pooled standard deviation of the post-test score for both groups, meaning that the programme made a noticeable positive impact. This effect can be envisaged as suggesting that on average pupils receiving the intervention would make approximately three additional months’ progress over the course of a year compared to similar pupils who did not. The evaluation identified positive results for all groups of pupils (defined by sex, first language, ethnicity, special educational needs, free school meal eligibility and measured attainment at the outset). However, it is important to note that conclusions about specific groups of pupils are more tentative than the overall finding, because the study was primarily designed to test the average impact on all identified children.","['Teaching assistants', 'One to one tuition', 'Phonics']",NA,,NA,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['11', '12']",NA,NA,,19,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""19 schools[¬e]""']",,19,"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""19 schools[¬e]""']",,19,"['Page 6:\n[¬s]"" in 19 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Y7 classes from 19 secondary schools.,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 10:\n[¬s]"" Nineteen schools were recruited to take part in the intervention.

Of the single cohort of kindergarten students (N = 35) participating, eight students received fall intervention from a trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and winter intervention using ""Road to the Code"" and six students received winter intervention from the trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"". The first research question investigated early literacy skills achievement, as measured by the Dynamic Indicator of Basic Literacy Skills, between treatment and comparison groups using two commercially available interventions  ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and ""Road to the Code"". The second research question examined learner characteristics and demographics as explanatory variables for early literacy skills achievement of the study sample. Study findings indicate that all treatment participants made statistically significant gains in early literacy skills achievement, generally kept pace with their non-at-risk peers, but that neither treatment closed the achievement gap between at-risk and not-at-risk for reading difficulty participants.

Multiple stepwise regression analysis found that non-intact biological family settings negatively impacted rapid letter naming, explaining between 13% and 14% of variance. Treatment fidelity examination indicates that the treatment was implemented with fidelity. Study recommendations include investigations into the impact of core reading instruction on early literacy skills in order to determine efficient intervention programming that supplements classroom instruction for specifically identified populations (e.g., Hispanic males residing in a single parent household) and longitudinal kindergarten cohort data collection of reading achievement on district-wide measurements in order to develop longevity data as related to later reading difficulty and relationship to treatment efficacy, additional supplemental services, and learner characteristics/demographics.

A matched sample test/retest approach was employed to examine differences in the reading performance of pupils who did and did not receive additional reading support. Whilst overall, pupils exposed to the whole class systematic phonics approach showed a significant improvement in reading performance, no added value was noted for pupils receiving learning support assistance.

The evaluation involved a quasi-experimental evaluation in which 33 students in years 7-9 in four schools used OVIP over an 8 week period and were monitored at three times for their word reading, phonic decoding and phonological skills. Students, teaching assistants and teachers involved were also interviewed about the use of OVIP, the perceived processes and outcomes. Assessment results showed that OVIP was associated with greater gains in word reading than these students' usual teaching/intervention approaches. Those interviewed also experienced benefits associated with using OVIP. It was further found that word reading gains were not related to a measure of being at risk of significant literacy difficulties. Participants identified the use of their own voice, the student's agency and working at their own pace as key factors relevant to how OVIP worked. These factors aligned with a working OVIP programme theory. The findings are discussed in terms of further development and research related to an own voice approach to addressing persistent literacy difficulties.

Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure  however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies.

37671562,Hatcher (2006),2006,"Background  This study evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention for reading-delayed children in Year-1 classes. Methods  A sample (N = 77) of children drawn from 14 schools representing those with the weakest reading skills were randomly allocated to one of two groups. A 20-week intervention group received the intervention for two consecutive 10-week periods, while a 10-week intervention group only received the intervention for the second 10 weeks of the study. The programme was delivered in daily 20-minute sessions that alternated between small group (N = 3) and individual teaching. The programme combined phoneme awareness training, word and text reading, and phonological linkage exercises. Results  The children receiving the intervention during the first 10-week period made significantly more progress on measures of letter knowledge, single word reading, and phoneme awareness than children not receiving the intervention. However, the children who only received the intervention during the second 10-week period made rapid progress and appeared to catch up with the children who had been given the more prolonged intervention. Failure to respond to the intervention was predicted by poor initial literacy skills and being in receipt of free school meals. Conclusion  A reading intervention programme delivered on a daily basis by trained teaching assistants is an effective intervention for children who show reading delays at the end of their first year in school. However, around one-quarter of the children did not respond to this intervention and these children would appear to need more intensive or more prolonged help to improve their reading skills.

It aims to improve the numeracy of low attaining pupils. The support consists of two 15-minute one-to-one sessions led by TAs each week over a school year. In this trial, pupils were selected by schools based on maths attainment and the professional judgement of teachers. If participating pupils were judged to have reached an age-appropriate level of numeracy on the basis of termly assessment, they were ‘rolled-off’ the programme and no longer received support. Each school was asked to appoint a member of staff as the Catch Up® Numeracy Coordinator to coordinate the intervention and to support the TAs. Prior to the start of the intervention, TAs received three half-days of training and Catch Up® Numeracy Coordinators received one half-day of training. Catch Up® Numeracy was developed by the Catch Up® charity, part of the Caxton Trust, together with Dr Ann Dowker of Oxford University. This was a randomised controlled trial involving 150 schools. Schools were randomly allocated to either deliver Catch Up® Numeracy or be in an ‘active control’ comparison group delivering a broadly time-equivalent amount of TA-led numeracy support sessions informed by the EEF’s ‘Making best use of teaching assistants’ guidance report. The implementation and process evaluation involved  surveys of TAs, school coordinators, and senior leaders  analysis of delivery data  and case studies of intervention and comparison schools. The intervention began in September 2016 and finished in July 2017. Impact was measured using the Progress Test in Maths by GL Assessment.","['Teaching assistants', 'One to one tuition']",NA,,NA,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['9', '10', '8', '6', '7', '11']",NA,NA,,75,"['Page 28:\n[¬s]""Catch Up® (school n=75;[¬e]""']",,76,"['Page 28:\n[¬s]""Active control (school n=76[¬e]""']",,151,"['Page 28:\n[¬s]""Randomised (school n=151[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['No'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Schools were randomly allocated to either deliver Catch Up® Numeracy or be in an ‘active control’ comparison group[¬e]""']",NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 18:\n[¬s]"" First, the school-level data was pre-processed—checking school names, Unique Reference Numbers, and postcodes against Edubase records.

This paper describes Catch Up Numeracy, a non-intensive targeted intervention for children who are low-attaining in mathematics, which is delivered by classroom assistants in only thirty minutes per week. Data for 440 children, including controls, show that children receiving Catch Up Numeracy intervention attained average gains more than twice that expected of typically attaining children, and more than twice that attained by children receiving non-targeted mathematics support. The evidence suggests that Catch Up Numeracy is effective for children who are low-attaining in mathematics.

Children were randomly assigned into 2 groups  (a) a phonological awareness intervention group or (b) a no-intervention control group. Educational assistants were trained to provide phonological and letter-sound awareness intervention in 20-minute lessons, five times per week in groups of 2 children, for 14 weeks. Additionally, all students received classroom phonological awareness programming. Lessons were scripted and contained examples, practice, and review. Children were assessed at pre-intervention on three phonological awareness and three alphabetic measures. Probes were administered at three points during the intervention and at two post-intervention maintenance points. Results indicated statistically significant group performance for children in the intervention group on measures of initial sound fluency, phonemic segmentation, and nonsense word fluency skills using measures designed to show change in these skills over time. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the norm-referenced, standardized measures of phonological awareness and print knowledge and on letter naming fluency at the end of the intervention. The data provide evidence to support the clinical practice of the provision of small group, direct, explicit, and intense phonological and letter-sound awareness intervention supplementary to whole class phonological awareness programming for kindergarten children with moderate to severe language impairment.

Schools commonly use Tier 2 reading interventions in Response to Intervention (RtI) frameworks to help close the gap between at-risk readers and their peers who read on grade-level. This dissertation presents the findings of a quasi-experimental research study of the effects of three Tier 2 reading interventions in an urban Title I elementary school’s RtI framework. A regression discontinuity design (RDD) with two cutoff points was used to assign 320 students in grades 1-6 to two types of Tier 2 reading interventions administered by paraeducators  direct instruction (DI) and computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Students were assigned using normal curve equivalent reading composite scores on the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement II, Brief Form (KTEA-II BFR). Students scoring below a lower cutoff were assigned to a DI reading intervention, while students scoring at or below an upper cutoff and above the lower cutoff were assigned to CAI reading interventions. January and May posttest iterations of the KTEA-II BFR served as outcome measures for all students. Results of the analysis indicated that the DI intervention was more effective than the CAI interventions at the lower cutoff ( p < .01). Participation in CAI interventions was not any more or less effective than business-as-usual reading activities (p > .10). These findings suggest that CAI programs may not be as helpful in closing the achievement gap between struggling students and their peers as DI interventions, and should be implemented with deliberation.

Specifically it evaluates a reading intervention programme devised by educational psychologists and delivered by teaching assistants specially trained by a psychologist. The article assesses the extent to which a psychologist, working through school personnel, added value to the education process within participating schools, the nature of that value and the challenges that had to be overcome. Results showed significant group level improvements in word recognition abilities amongst readers with delayed reading, although the extent of these improvements varied according to school and age with older pupils benefiting more than younger ones. Girls gained more than boys, but this difference was not statistically significant. It was also demonstrated that the programme could be delivered to schools on a low budget including the training of school personnel and taught effectively by non-professional teachers with minimum disruption.

Four 15-minute sessions per week are delivered by a teaching assistant (TA) to groups of three to five pupils. This report summarizes the findings of a randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of ABRA on literacy outcomes for Year 1 pupils. The trial also assesses the impact of an offline, paper and pencil version of the same intervention (referred to here at ""the non-Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) intervention""). There were 51 participating schools and 2,241 pupils at randomization, and a total of 48 schools and 1,884 pupils were included in the final analysis (84% of the initial pupils at randomization). The trial took place between October 2014 and May 2015. Fifty-one schools were randomly assigned to either receive some version of the intervention or to act as a ""control"" school delivering business as usual. In the schools receiving the intervention, pupils were randomized to receive one of the following options  (1) ABRA, (2) the non-ICT intervention, and (3) standard literacy provision. The process evaluation involved observing sessions to understand a variety of factors in the intervention. These included an evaluation of which elements contributed to successful implementation, the perceptions and experiences of TAs and project leads, levels of pupil engagement, and the mechanisms behind the estimated impacts. This was an efficacy study, due to the involvement of the developer in the delivery of the program. Key conclusions of this report are  (1) The children who received ABRA, or its offline alternative were found to make two and three months' progress in literacy respectively compared to the children who received standard provision. This positive result would be unlikely to occur by chance  (2) For both ABRA and the offline alternative, the impact for children eligible for free school meals and children with below average pre-test outcomes was larger than for all pupils  (3) Successful implementation contributed to a well-designed and delivered training program which emphasized fidelity and consistency, enforced by ongoing support from the project team  (4) The process evaluation found that both the ICT and non-ICT interventions may be best delivered in groups of similar rather than mixed ability. The process evaluation also suggested minor changes to the intervention to make it more culturally relevant to British pupils, and to remove some repetition in the non-ICT program  and (5) Future research will examine whether ABRA or the non-ICT intervention can be successfully delivered at scale, and will look at longer-term impacts through assessing Key Stage 1 data from this trial.

Key conclusions include  (1) This evaluation provided evidence of promise  there was a positive, statistically significant effect on the primary outcome measure of reading comprehension. However, this effect size was lower than the minimum detectable effect size of the trial, so we cannot confidently conclude that the effect was due to the intervention and did not occur by chance  (2) The secondary outcome measures indicated positive impacts on children's literacy skills, but these were not statistically significant  (3) This intervention is recommended to take place during the school day, when it is easier to secure sustained co-operation and support from school staff.

37671575,Nelson (2010),2010,"Broadly, the current study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive effects of PA (phonological awareness) interventions for preschoolers, demonstrating that PA instruction need not be postponed until kindergarten. Specifically, the current study addresses the paucity of research on PA training in preschool by testing the efficacy of a supplemental cohesive and explicit PA focused intervention that has been shown in previous studies to improve PA and alphabetic knowledge of at-risk kindergarteners. Second, the current study employs community-based paraeducator tutors as interventionists, and in so doing, extends other early K-1 reading research showing that paraeducators can deliver supplemental early reading interventions with a high degree of fidelity, particularly if the interventions are well scripted for non-certificated teachers' use. Finally, the authors chose to use a modified form of Interactive Book Reading as their comparison (control) condition to (a) control for supplemental instruction time and consistency, and (b) provide an alternative intervention approach appropriate for preschoolers. Indeed, studies support the benefit of interactive storybook reading for building emergent literacy skills  however, supplemental instruction that focuses on vocabulary acquisition has not, to date, been tested against explicit supplemental instruction in PA focused instruction with diverse (i.e., low socioeconomic, limited English proficiency) preschool children. Thus, this study also provides information regarding the relative impact of two approaches on preschoolers' PA and alphabetic and vocabulary knowledge. The primary research questions for the current study were  (a) does a supplemental PA focused intervention implemented by paraeducators have a direct, positive impact on at-risk preschool children's literacy outcomes?, and (b) does the intervention have a unique impact on children's outcomes, after controlling for pretest skill, classroom and home literacy environments, and treatment fidelity?

38296657,Nunes (2018),2018,"1stClass@Number was developed by the Every Child Counts (ECC) team at Edge Hill University to support pupils who are struggling with mathematics. The ECC team trained teaching assistants (TAs) to deliver highly scripted lessons to small groups of up to four children. The programme is normally implemented outside of mathematics lessons in other lesson time. It covers five basic mathematics topics  the number system, place value, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The lessons include the teaching of procedures (for example, counting on, counting up to, counting backwards, and counting in twos and in fives), mathematical signs (+, -, =) and mathematical language and concepts (such as more, less, and equal). Schools are advised to deliver 30 lessons of approximately half an hour, usually three times a week for ten weeks, and are encouraged to deliver additional sessions for pupils who need them. A classroom teacher colleague (the “Link Teacher”) is expected to meet the TA once a week to help them review and plan upcoming lessons, and provide feedback. 1stClass@Number was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial. 133 schools in South and West Yorkshire each nominated four children in Year 2 to participate in the project. The schools were then randomly assigned either to receive the intervention or to continue with their normal teaching in Year 2 and receive the opportunity to implement another ECC intervention with a different year group. The primary outcome for the trial was the Quantitative Reasoning Test, which focuses on number knowledge and mathematical problem solving, and the secondary outcome was performance in end-of-KS1 maths tests. A process evaluation collected additional data through observations, questionnaires, and phone interviews. The recruitment of schools began in September 2015 and the research completed in July 2017.

The primary research question was to investigate whether first grade students in RF schools would have better reading performances than those students in non-RF schools as measured by Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) subtests. The secondary research question was concerned with whether third and fourth grade students in RF schools performed better than those students in non-RF schools on statewide-mandated English Language Arts (ELA) assessment measures. A three-year longitudinal study was conducted to examine the ELA scores between 2006 and 2008. The data were obtained from six elementary schools in two rural school districts in Louisiana. The results showed that the first grade RF students had better performances in reading than the non-RF students at the beginning of the school year 2007–08. However, the differences in the adjusted means of the DIBELS subtests (Nonsense Word Fluency and Oral Reading Fluency) were not statistically significant at the end of the school year. Also, all of the first graders in both the RF and non-RF schools demonstrated significant gains in their reading skills. As the non-RF schools had adopted some of the RF components in their reading instruction, the findings indicated that the RF practices, which were based on scientifically based reading research (SBRR), helped produce positive reading outcomes in both RF and non-RF classrooms. The study also confirmed the efficacy of using well-trained paraprofessionals as intervention implementers. As for the statewide-mandated ELA assessment, the findings of the longitudinal study indicated that the students in the RF schools performed better than those in the non-RF schools on statewide-mandated ELA assessments between 2006 and 2008. The study provided evidence that the efforts of the RF program in implementing research-based reading instructional strategies into classrooms were successful.

38296668,Rutt (2014),2014,"Catch Up® Numeracy is a one to one intervention for learners who are struggling with numeracy. It consists of two 15-minute sessions per week, delivered by teaching assistants (TAs). The approach is based on research indicating that numeracy is not a single skill, but a composite of several component skills that are relatively discrete. The intervention breaks numeracy down into ten elements, including counting verbally, counting objects, word problems and estimation. Pupils are assessed on each component and instruction is targeted on those areas requiring development. In this evaluation, the intervention was run for 30 weeks and delivered to Year 2-6 pupils who were struggling with numeracy, as identified by TAs. The Catch Up Numeracy intervention was compared to a ‘business as usual’ control group and a ‘time equivalent’ intervention group, who received the same amount of one to one teaching by TAs, but did not use Catch Up Numeracy. Those TAs delivering Catch Up Numeracy were supplied with detailed session plans and received three half-day training sessions, led by Catch Up and Dr Ann Dowker of the University of Oxford. The project ran from September 2012 to July 2013. The overall effect size of Catch Up Numeracy in comparison to the ‘business as usual’ control group was +0.21, meaning the programme led to a noticeable improvement in numeracy outcomes. This effect size suggests that, on average, pupils receiving the interventions would make approximately three additional months of progress over the course of the year compared to pupils that did not. However, the ‘time equivalent’ group also showed similar significant gains (+0.27), suggesting the effect is likely to be a result of regular and sustained one to one teaching, rather than an intrinsic benefit of Catch Up Numeracy. The study demonstrates that one to one teaching with TAs is an effective strategy to increase numeracy skills in Year 2-6 pupils. Sub-group analysis did not identify any differential effects for pupil gender or eligibility for free school meals. The process evaluation indicated that most TAs valued Catch Up Numeracy and believed it had a positive impact on pupils’ confidence, engagement with learning and willingness to attempt numeracy problems.","['Teaching assistants', 'One to one tuition']",NA,,NA,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England', 'Wales']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11']",NA,NA,,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 6:\n[¬s]""hree groups: a control group that received normal teaching, a Catch Up Numeracy intervention group that received the intervention as described above, and an ‘equivalent time’ group that received two 15 minute sessions a week without Catch Up Numeracy, to replicate the one to one nature of the intervention.[¬e]""']",NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 13:\n[¬s]""This was a pupil-randomised trial but the randomisation was stratified by school.[¬e]""', 'Page 9:\n[¬s]"" Teaching assistants were randomised to one of two intervention groups: one delivering a time equivalent intervention and the other delivering the Catch Up intervention.

Rime-based, phoneme-based, and ‘mixed’ (rime and phoneme-based) interventions were contrasted with controls receiving only the National Literacy Strategy. Phonological onset-rime and phoneme manipulation, spelling, and word and non-word reading were measured before and after the nine-week intervention. High rime neighbourhood (HRn) non-words (e.g. ‘dat’ – with many real word rime neighbours) and low rime neighbourhood (LRn) non-words (e.g. ‘tav’ with few real word neighbours) were used to evaluate onset-rime- or grapheme-phoneme-based decoding strategies. Results showed greater phonological onset-rime skills, lettersound knowledge and non-word reading skills in all LSA-taught intervention groups. There was no difference between the HRn and LRn non-words. The only reliable difference between the intervention groups was an advantage in phoneme blending for the rime-taught group. It was concluded that LSAs can enhance literacy development for 6-year-old poor readers.

38296671,See (2018),2018,"Maths Counts aims to raise the attainment of children who struggle with basic mathematics at Key Stage 2. The intervention was developed by The Mead Community Primary School drawing on the principles of the Numbers Count programme developed by Every Child Counts at Edge Hill University. Maths Counts lessons last 30 minutes and take place at least three times a week for a minimum of ten weeks. Schools have access to an online tool that stores information about pupils’ progress, supports the planning of lesson objectives, and suggests activities and resources for each lesson. The first ten minutes of Maths Counts lessons focus on recall and reinforcement of prior learning, and the following 20 minutes introduce new knowledge and skills. The online tool suggests activities and resources to use, such as throwing and catching a soft football in order to count in sequenced steps or using coins to develop an understanding of money. In this project, schools selected pupils in Years 3 to 6 to participate in the intervention, prioritising pupils at risk of not achieving nationally expected levels, younger pupils, and pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium. The intervention was delivered on a one-to-one basis by teaching assistants. Schools were able to approach the timetabling of the intervention flexibly, so some lessons were scheduled during maths lessons while some took place elsewhere in the school day. Teaching assistants were supported by their schools’ maths leads (the school’s maths co-ordinator or specialist teacher). Support for delivery of the intervention was provided by the Mead Academy Trust project team. Before the intervention started, the project team provided two days of training for both maths leads and teaching assistants. The maths leads then delivered four further training sessions throughout the intervention to the teaching assistants in their school. After an initial development phase where the project team developed a website and the online tool, Maths Counts was evaluated by Durham University using a randomised controlled trial involving 291 pupils across 35 schools. Each school identified eight eligible pupils, four of whom were randomised to receive the intervention while the other four formed the ‘business as usual’ comparison group. The trial tested the impact of Maths Counts on maths attainment measured using the General Maths component of the CEM InCAS assessment. The implementation and process evaluation consisted of observations and interviews.

37671585,Sibieta (2016),2016,"The Nuffield Early Language Intervention is designed to improve the spoken language ability of children during the transition from nursery to primary school. It is targeted at children with relatively poor spoken language skills. Three sessions per week are delivered to groups of two to four children starting in the final term of nursery and continuing in the first two terms of reception in primary school. Children in primary school also attend an additional two 15-minute individual sessions per week. All sessions focus on listening, narrative and vocabulary skills. Work on phonological awareness is introduced in the final ten weeks. The intervention was developed by researchers from the University of York with funding from the Nuffield Foundation. The communications charity I CAN was enlisted to train teaching assistants and nursery staff to deliver the programme. This report evaluates the I CAN-led model for the 30-week programme described above and also a shorter 20-week version delivered only in reception year. The impact of these two programmes on the language skills of 350 children in 34 schools was tested using a randomised controlled trial design. Schools with attached nursery schools or nursery classes in Yorkshire and the South East were recruited to the trial in 2013. Children identified as having relatively low language skills were randomly allocated to the 30-week programme, the 20-week programme or standard provision. The qualitative fieldwork carried out as part of the project involved interviews with a total of 12 staff in 8 of the 34 participating schools. Key conclusions include  (1) The Nuffield Early Language Intervention had a positive impact on the language skills of children in the trial. This is true for both the more expensive, 30-week version, starting in nursery, and the 20-week version, delivered only in school  (2) Children receiving the 30-week version experienced the equivalent of about four months of additional progress, compared with about 2 months additional progress for the 20-week version.

It is based on research by the Centre for Reading and Language at York and is delivered by specially trained teaching assistants (TAs). This evaluation tested two REACH interventions, one based directly on the original ‘Reading Intervention’ developed by York, and one adapted from it with supplementary material on language comprehension. In both versions, pupils received three one to one 35 minute sessions each week for 20 weeks. Pupils were taken out of other lessons (typically not English lessons) for the sessions and so this evaluation assesses the effect of the interventions combined with more time focused on literacy, compared with standard provision. The impact of the interventions on the reading skills of 287 pupils in 27 schools was tested using a randomised controlled trial. Schools in areas close to Leeds were recruited to the trial in 2013. Pupils identified as having relatively poor reading skills were randomly allocated to the original REACH reading intervention, the language comprehension version, or standard provision.

Once assigned to a class type a student was to remain in the assigned class type as long as he/she was in the project. Due primarily to teacher-identified discipline problems and some parent complaints, the STAR consortium had to revise this procedure after the kindergarten year. Since there were no differences on any measure for students in regular and regular with aide classes, students who had been in these class types in kindergarten were reassigned randomly within the two dass types for first grade. The external advisory committee informed STAR that this interchanging could create problems in conduding longitudinal analysis. Therefore, first grade was the only grade in which students in regular and regular with aide classes were permitted to interchange. No further changes were made after first grade.",,['Multisite RCT'],"['Page 30:\n[¬s]"" Class Type (SmalVRegularIAide) was assumed to be a fixed dimension; mean differences among class types comprise the most important question of the investigation.""\n"" all three class types were present in each school[¬e]""']",NA,,Yes,"['Page 21:\n[¬s]""Two key design decisions were to have a within-school design\nand random assignment of both teachers and students to class types.
