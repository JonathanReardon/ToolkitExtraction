A further three schools—one in the Catch Up® arm and two in the active control—were lost to the follow- up post-test in October–December 2017. The intervention school had fully implemented the Catch Up® Numeracy intervention, but was unwilling to administer additional tests to their pupils. Although attrition was within acceptable bounds at the school level (5%), at pupil-level, attrition was high (17%). Of the 1,794 pupils who received treatment in the Catch Up® and active control arms at the start of the main trial, 1,775 were matched to National Pupil Database records (after the withdrawal of the Catch Up® schools) and complete records for the primary model were available for a total of 1,481 pupils. This was 83% of pupils randomised—737 pupils receiving Catch Up® and 744 pupils receiving the active control condition. Attrition was due to a combination of factors in addition to school and pupil withdrawals: • Delayed post-testing: the delayed post-testing took place in the autumn term of the academic year following implementation. As a result, 129 pupils, 7% of pupils allocated, had left school (including transfers to middle schools). • Pupil absence: 107 pupils were absent at the time of post-testing; 49 pupils completed the post- tests later. However, a total of 58 pupils, 3% of pupils allocated, were missing post-tests. • Missing pre- and post-tests: despite considerable efforts and additional expense by the evaluation team, GL Assessment were unable to account for 60 pre-tests and 7 post-tests, leading to further attrition of 49 pupils (42 pre-tests and 7 post-tests). This constituted 3% of pupils allocated and resulted in the loss of pre-tests for two complete schools.
