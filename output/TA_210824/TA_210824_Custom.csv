37671594,Bennett (2013),2013,"This study evaluated the impact of a computerized visuospatial memory training intervention on the memory and behavioral skills of children with Down syndrome. Teaching assistants were trained to support the delivery of a computerized intervention program to individual children over a 10-16 week period in school. Twenty-one children aged 7-12 years with Down syndrome were randomly allocated to either an intervention or waiting list control group. Following training, performance on trained and non-trained visuospatial short-term memory tasks was significantly enhanced for children in the intervention group. This improvement was sustained four months later. These results suggest that computerized visuospatial memory training in a school setting is both feasible and effective for children with Down syndrome.

38296603,Biggart (2015),2015,"Tutoring with Alphie is a computer-assisted programme that aims to improve the literacy skills of struggling readers. The programme combines elements of collaborative (or ‘cooperative’) learning, computer-assisted instruction and small group support. Participating pupils are grouped in pairs and follow a series of activities that seek to improve reading comprehension and fluency of expression. Pupils are supervised by a tutor, most commonly a teaching assistant. The programme was designed by the charity Success for All and was adapted from a programme which was available in the United States for younger struggling readers (6–7 years). This project sought to assess the impact of the programme on Year 6 pupils who were at risk of not achieving Level 4a and above in reading at the end of Key Stage 2. 72 pupils from six schools across England completed the trial. Pupils followed the programme on a daily basis for 30 minutes each day over a period of six weeks. Typically four to eight pupils, split into pairs with similar levels of prior attainment, would participate at the same time.

There was no evidence that the presence of TAs, or any characteristic of TAs, had a measurable effect on pupil attainment. However, results were clear in showing that TAs had an indirect effect on teaching, e.g. pupils had a more active form of interaction with the teacher and there was more individualised teacher attention. This supported teachers' views that TAs are effective in supporting them in this way. The authors conclude that more attention needs to be paid to what they call the pedagogical role of TAs so that they can be used effectively to help teachers and pupils, particularly in the context of the enhanced roles for TAs being introduced as part of the Government's remodelling agenda.

Teachers and teaching assistants used either Additional Literacy Support (ALS), a highly structured set of small group teaching materials devised by the English National Literacy Strategy, or a wide variety of other materials including other published intervention programmes, reading scheme-based, computer-based and individually designed interventions, or a combination of ALS and other interventions. The influence of a broad range of contextual factors were investigated, especially whether children's qualities, school factors such as socioeconomic status and class size, and delivery differences made significant differences to the outcomes of the different interventions. The study used a naturalistic quasi-experimental design, in which teachers were asked to record details of their children and interventions without altering their professional decisions, which has not been used before in investigating literacy difficulties in context. ALS was marginally more effective than other interventions in the majority of classes, but was clearly superior in value for money terms. Children's qualities did not appear to affect outcomes. Although children receiving additional help made better than average progress, overall catch-up was limited, especially in spelling. ",0.6246,0.238

Methods  Teaching assistants (TAs) were trained to deliver a reading and language intervention to children in individual daily 40-min sessions. We used a waiting list control design, in which half the sample received the intervention immediately, whereas the remaining children received the treatment after a 20-week delay. Fifty-seven children with Down syndrome in mainstream primary schools in two UK locations (Yorkshire and Hampshire) were randomly allocated to intervention (40 weeks of intervention) and waiting control (20 weeks of intervention) groups. Assessments were conducted at three time points  pre-intervention, after 20 weeks of intervention, and after 40 weeks of intervention. Results  After 20 weeks of intervention, the intervention group showed significantly greater progress than the waiting control group on measures of single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme blending and taught expressive vocabulary. Effects did not transfer to other skills (nonword reading, spelling, standardised expressive and receptive vocabulary, expressive information and grammar). After 40 weeks of intervention, the intervention group remained numerically ahead of the control group on most key outcome measures  but these differences were not significant. Children who were younger, attended more intervention sessions, and had better initial receptive language skills made greater progress during the course of the intervention.

37671598,Cole (2009),2009,"Billions of dollars are spent annually in response to widespread underachievement in areas of math and reading (National Assessment of Education Progress, 2003). Efficacy of these remedial academic programs is often poorly documented and few programs are designed to address individual needs (Kahne, Nagaoka, Brown, O'Brien, Quinn, & Thiede, 2001  Granger, Durlak, Yohalem, & Reisner, 2007). Furthermore, many students do not benefit from these programs due to behavior deficits that impact learning (Granger et al., 2007). The Challenging Horizons Program (CHP) is an evidence-based after-school program that provides an effective framework for engaging students with behavior deficits in learning activities (Langberg, Smith, Bogle, Schmidt, Cole, & Pender, 2006). At the start of this dissertation, the CHP did not have a curriculum targeting students' math performance. This dissertation describes the development of a remedial math intervention delivered within the Challenging Horizons Program designed to be delivered by paraprofessionals with limited training in teaching. To evaluate the curriculum, participants were randomly assigned to either receive the CHP as usual (N = 13) or the CHP plus math intervention 4 days a week (N=13). Outcomes were measured using brief timed assessments of basic math calculation and word problem solving, which showed generally positive effect sizes but low rates of reliable change on a case-by-case basis. No differences in skipping items between the control and treatment groups were observed on the basic calculation weekly assessment measure. Overall, this pilot study suggests that this math intervention can feasibly be delivered by paraprofessionals but some procedural and methodological limitations cloud the interpretation of the results with regard to the efficacy of the math intervention.

37671620,Cooper (2016) TA,2016,"This study presents an exploratory evaluation of a seven week cross-age peer-tutoring mathematics intervention, Paired Maths (based on Topping, Kearney, McGee and Pugh, 2004), as delivered in a UK secondary school. The impact of Paired Maths on the mathematics attainment of tutees, and the self-esteem of both tutees and tutors is evaluated. Paired Maths involves pairs of students, one student in the role of a tutor and one in the role of a tutee, completing mathematics activities together. Tutors are trained to follow a structured process to scaffold their tutee's learning during the activities. Although existing theory and literature suggests that a cross-age, peer-tutoring intervention around mathematics could have a positive impact, no research has experimentally evaluated Paired Maths in the UK secondary school to date. A total of 78 participants, aged 12-15 years, from three secondary schools situated in a small city in England took part. A Randomised Control Trial was used to consider the impact for Year 8 participants in the role of the Tutee. This compared children randomly assigned to either a Paired Maths (Experimental) Group, a Teaching Assistant Led Comparison Group or a Waitlist Control Group. Results showed no statistically significant differences between groups in mathematics attainment or self-esteem. Within the same exploratory evaluation, a Randomised Control Trial was also employed to consider the impact for the Year 10 students in the role of the tutor. This compared children randomly assigned to either the Paired Maths (Experimental) group or a Waitlist Control Group. Although Waitlist Control participants saw a statistically significant decrease on measures of Maths self-concept over time, results showed no other statistically significant differences between groups in self-esteem. Overall, Paired Maths was not considered to have had a positive impact on mathematics attainment for children in the role of the tutee, or on the self-esteem of children either in the role of tutee or tutor. These findings are considered in relation to the literature and methodology adopted, with a number of possible explanations presented. Possible avenues for future research are proposed (within and also beyond the post-positivist paradigm) with the key conclusion that further exploration is needed around what may support the successful implementation of a Paired Maths programme with secondary aged Pupils. Key limitations of the research relate to the measurement of the dependent variables and treatment fidelity. ",0.0241,0.3594
37671548,Dockrell (2015),2015,"""Talk for Writing"" is an approach to teaching writing that emphasizes three teaching methods  (1) 'imitation' (where pupils learn texts by heart, so they can discuss and dissect them)  (2) 'innovation' (where pupils adapt stories to create their own versions)  and (3) 'invention' (where teachers help pupils to create original stories). These tasks aim to improve writing ability by giving pupils an understanding of the structure and elements of written language. This project sought to develop ""Talk for Writing"" into a whole-school programme. The pilot programme ran for 18 months, from January 2013 to July 2014, and involved ten schools in Portsmouth. It included a series of 6 full days for school leadership teams (project teams) plus three whole school conferences (""Big Days"") to train teachers and teaching assistants. It covered all primary age groups from nursery to year 6. In addition to the training and support for schools, the programme provided materials, resources, and guidance for staff development, planning and progression. Each school appointed a ""literacy lead"", who was responsible for implementing the programme. This developmental pilot was subject to an evaluation, which had three aims  (1) to appraise the research literature underpinning key dimensions of the ""Talk for Writing"" pedagogy  (2) to evaluate the promise and feasibility of the programme, and provide formative recommendations to inform future evaluation and development  and (3) to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the potential impact of the programme on writing skills that could be used to inform any future trial. The evaluation took place over twelve months and involved six of the 10 intervention schools, one of which withdrew halfway through the programme following the appointment of a new headteacher, and three comparison schools. There were two comparison schools in Portsmouth and one in London. Key conclusions of the project were  (1) most of the teachers were enthusiastic about implementing Talk for Writing within a whole school approach and felt that it provided a consistent approach to teaching writing. However, one school was withdrawn from the project by a new headteacher  (2) features of the programme were embedded in the classrooms, and teachers generally found the programme straightforward to implement  (3) the project displayed mixed evidence of promise. Teachers reported that it had an impact on pupils' writing skills. However, the literature review found mixed support from the current research base for the principles underlying the programme  (4) further research is required to securely estimate the impact of the approach on academic attainment. It would be valuable to undertake some additional development work to refine the approach before it undergoes a full trial  and (5) other research suggests that oral language may play a stronger role in supporting writing in the early years than in Key Stage 2. The programme might benefit from targeted support of key oral language competencies to support the production of early written text in struggling writers and those with weaker oral language skills.

By contrast, much lower proportions of each of the various control groups studied were found to perform this well. Since the readiness scores for the Chicago experimental group reported in M.A. Wallach and L. Wallach (1976) were comparable to those for the present Roanoke Rapids experimental sample (median per centile scores of 25 and 17.5 respectively) and since the Spache Word Recognition and Reading Passages subtests were administered in both studies, comparison may be of interest. While both experimental samples were found to perform considerably better than their respective controls, the Roanoke Rapids experimentals turn out if anything to be superior on these Spache tests to the Chicago experimentals as well. The results of the present study thus replicate and extend the findings reported in 1976. The results suggest that the Wallach and Wallach program may be on the right track in its emphasis on phoneme identification skills for low-readiness children, and that the program can be successfully applied by appropriately supervised paraprofessionals.",1.1638,0.3513

Methods This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a reading and language intervention for 6‐year‐old children identified by research criteria as being at risk of dyslexia (n = 56), and their school‐identified peers (n = 89). An Experimental group received two 9‐week blocks of daily intervention delivered by trained teaching assistants  the Control group received 9 weeks of typical classroom instruction, followed by 9 weeks of intervention. Results Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses, small‐to‐moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. However, these were fragile and short lived, and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word‐level reading. Conclusions This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions, yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation. We suggest that the intervention may have been too short to yield improvements in oral language  and that literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened training effects. We argue that reporting of null results makes an important contribution in terms of raising standards both of trial reporting and educational practice.",0.0886,0.2676

37671623,Gibbs (2001),2001,"This study was designed to determine the effects of a one-to-one phonological awareness intervention on the beginning reading skills of first-grade students in four elementary schools who were identified as at risk for the acquisition of beginning reading. Effects were measured using standardized measures of phonological awareness, letter-word identification and word attack skills. The procedure for this study consisted of three phases including a screening phase designed to identify participants for the study, an in-service training for teaching assistants who implemented the treatment intervention, and the intervention implementation. Sixty-three participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or control conditions. The performance of the treatment group and the control group was compared. The treatment condition consisted of a 10-minute, one-to-one intervention that included the recommended components of curriculum design for students who are at risk for learning and systematically addressed letter-sound correspondences, blending, segmenting, and the use of onset rimes. The control condition was a traditional, supplemental intervention for students at risk for learning to read. A two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to examine the data and to test for differences within groups and between groups on conceptually similar measures. The amount of change from pretest to posttest was significant for both groups in letter-word identification with a modest effect size of .77 for the control group and a very large effect size of 1.62 for the experimental group. The amount of change from pretest to posttest was also significant for both groups in word attack with a modest effect size of .68 for the control condition and a more robust effect size of 1.58 for the experimental condition. The amount of change from pretest to posttest in phonological awareness was significant for both groups, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups. The results of this study indicate that a one-to-one phonological awareness intervention can improve word reading ability and selected word attack skills of first grade students identified as at risk to a greater extent than a traditional, supplemental intervention in a balanced literacy program.

It is delivered on a one to one basis by staff, most commonly teaching assistants, who have been trained in the approach. The purpose of Switch-on is to achieve functional literacy for as many pupils as possible, and so to close the reading achievement gap for vulnerable children working below age-expected levels. It is inspired by the well- established intervention Reading Recovery, which is teacher led and delivered over a 12-20 week period. In this evaluation, the programme involved regular sessions for pupils who had not achieved Level 4 English at Key Stage 2. The identified pupils in Year 7 attended regular 20-minute reading sessions over the course of the Spring term. The students were removed from class to attend the sessions, which aimed to improve their reading comprehension and fluency. Each session required students to read from four different books graded on the basis of their difficulty. Training and support for staff was provided by the Every Child a Reader staff of Nottinghamshire Local Authority. The overall result was an effect size of +0.24, based on the pooled standard deviation of the post-test score for both groups, meaning that the programme made a noticeable positive impact. This effect can be envisaged as suggesting that on average pupils receiving the intervention would make approximately three additional months’ progress over the course of a year compared to similar pupils who did not. The evaluation identified positive results for all groups of pupils (defined by sex, first language, ethnicity, special educational needs, free school meal eligibility and measured attainment at the outset). However, it is important to note that conclusions about specific groups of pupils are more tentative than the overall finding, because the study was primarily designed to test the average impact on all identified children.",0.237,0.1144

The QuickSmart instructional program consists of three structured, teacher- or teacher aide-directed, 30-minute, small-group lessons each week for approximately 26 weeks. In this study, 42 middle school students experiencing learning difficulties (LD) completed the QuickSmart reading program, and a further 42 students with LD took part in the QuickSmart mathematics program. To investigate the effects of the intervention, comparisons were made between the reading and mathematics progress of the intervention group and a group of 10 high-achieving and 10 average-achieving peers. The results indicated that although the standardized reading comprehension and mathematics scores of QuickSmart students remained below those of comparison students, they improved significantly from pretest to posttest.  In contrast, the standardized scores of comparison students were not significantly different from pretest to posttest. On measures of response speed and accuracy gathered using the Cognitive Aptitude Assessment System (CAAS), QuickSmart students were able to narrow the gap between their performance and that of their high- and average-achieving peers.

Of the single cohort of kindergarten students (N = 35) participating, eight students received fall intervention from a trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and winter intervention using ""Road to the Code"" and six students received winter intervention from the trained paraprofessional using ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"". The first research question investigated early literacy skills achievement, as measured by the Dynamic Indicator of Basic Literacy Skills, between treatment and comparison groups using two commercially available interventions  ""Stepping Stones to Literacy"" and ""Road to the Code"". The second research question examined learner characteristics and demographics as explanatory variables for early literacy skills achievement of the study sample. Study findings indicate that all treatment participants made statistically significant gains in early literacy skills achievement, generally kept pace with their non-at-risk peers, but that neither treatment closed the achievement gap between at-risk and not-at-risk for reading difficulty participants.

This article reports evidence from a small-scale study undertaken to evaluate the impact learning support assistants have on the reading attainment of young children taught in schools using a whole class systematic phonics approach. A matched sample test/retest approach was employed to examine differences in the reading performance of pupils who did and did not receive additional reading support. Whilst overall, pupils exposed to the whole class systematic phonics approach showed a significant improvement in reading performance, no added value was noted for pupils receiving learning support assistance.

The evaluation involved a quasi-experimental evaluation in which 33 students in years 7-9 in four schools used OVIP over an 8 week period and were monitored at three times for their word reading, phonic decoding and phonological skills. Students, teaching assistants and teachers involved were also interviewed about the use of OVIP, the perceived processes and outcomes. Assessment results showed that OVIP was associated with greater gains in word reading than these students' usual teaching/intervention approaches. Those interviewed also experienced benefits associated with using OVIP. It was further found that word reading gains were not related to a measure of being at risk of significant literacy difficulties. Participants identified the use of their own voice, the student's agency and working at their own pace as key factors relevant to how OVIP worked. These factors aligned with a working OVIP programme theory. The findings are discussed in terms of further development and research related to an own voice approach to addressing persistent literacy difficulties. ",0.6437,0.4221
37671520,Haley (2017),2017,"Background While practitioners are increasingly asked to be mindful of the evidence base of intervention programmes, evidence from rigorous trials for the effectiveness of interventions that promote oral language abilities in the early years is sparse. Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure  however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies. ",0.46,0.5
37671562,Hatcher (2006),2006,"Background  This study evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention for reading-delayed children in Year-1 classes. Methods  A sample (N = 77) of children drawn from 14 schools representing those with the weakest reading skills were randomly allocated to one of two groups. A 20-week intervention group received the intervention for two consecutive 10-week periods, while a 10-week intervention group only received the intervention for the second 10 weeks of the study. The programme was delivered in daily 20-minute sessions that alternated between small group (N = 3) and individual teaching. The programme combined phoneme awareness training, word and text reading, and phonological linkage exercises. Results  The children receiving the intervention during the first 10-week period made significantly more progress on measures of letter knowledge, single word reading, and phoneme awareness than children not receiving the intervention. However, the children who only received the intervention during the second 10-week period made rapid progress and appeared to catch up with the children who had been given the more prolonged intervention. Failure to respond to the intervention was predicted by poor initial literacy skills and being in receipt of free school meals. Conclusion  A reading intervention programme delivered on a daily basis by trained teaching assistants is an effective intervention for children who show reading delays at the end of their first year in school. However, around one-quarter of the children did not respond to this intervention and these children would appear to need more intensive or more prolonged help to improve their reading skills.

It aims to improve the numeracy of low attaining pupils. The support consists of two 15-minute one-to-one sessions led by TAs each week over a school year. In this trial, pupils were selected by schools based on maths attainment and the professional judgement of teachers. If participating pupils were judged to have reached an age-appropriate level of numeracy on the basis of termly assessment, they were ‘rolled-off’ the programme and no longer received support. Each school was asked to appoint a member of staff as the Catch Up® Numeracy Coordinator to coordinate the intervention and to support the TAs. Prior to the start of the intervention, TAs received three half-days of training and Catch Up® Numeracy Coordinators received one half-day of training. Catch Up® Numeracy was developed by the Catch Up® charity, part of the Caxton Trust, together with Dr Ann Dowker of Oxford University. This was a randomised controlled trial involving 150 schools.

Data for 440 children, including controls, show that children receiving Catch Up Numeracy intervention attained average gains more than twice that expected of typically attaining children, and more than twice that attained by children receiving non-targeted mathematics support. The evidence suggests that Catch Up Numeracy is effective for children who are low-attaining in mathematics.

Children were randomly assigned into 2 groups  (a) a phonological awareness intervention group or (b) a no-intervention control group. Educational assistants were trained to provide phonological and letter-sound awareness intervention in 20-minute lessons, five times per week in groups of 2 children, for 14 weeks. Additionally, all students received classroom phonological awareness programming. Lessons were scripted and contained examples, practice, and review. Children were assessed at pre-intervention on three phonological awareness and three alphabetic measures. Probes were administered at three points during the intervention and at two post-intervention maintenance points. Results indicated statistically significant group performance for children in the intervention group on measures of initial sound fluency, phonemic segmentation, and nonsense word fluency skills using measures designed to show change in these skills over time. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the norm-referenced, standardized measures of phonological awareness and print knowledge and on letter naming fluency at the end of the intervention.

Schools commonly use Tier 2 reading interventions in Response to Intervention (RtI) frameworks to help close the gap between at-risk readers and their peers who read on grade-level. This dissertation presents the findings of a quasi-experimental research study of the effects of three Tier 2 reading interventions in an urban Title I elementary school’s RtI framework. A regression discontinuity design (RDD) with two cutoff points was used to assign 320 students in grades 1-6 to two types of Tier 2 reading interventions administered by paraeducators  direct instruction (DI) and computer-assisted instruction (CAI). Students were assigned using normal curve equivalent reading composite scores on the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement II, Brief Form (KTEA-II BFR). Students scoring below a lower cutoff were assigned to a DI reading intervention, while students scoring at or below an upper cutoff and above the lower cutoff were assigned to CAI reading interventions. January and May posttest iterations of the KTEA-II BFR served as outcome measures for all students. Results of the analysis indicated that the DI intervention was more effective than the CAI interventions at the lower cutoff ( p < .01). Participation in CAI interventions was not any more or less effective than business-as-usual reading activities (p > .10). These findings suggest that CAI programs may not be as helpful in closing the achievement gap between struggling students and their peers as DI interventions, and should be implemented with deliberation.

Data analysis using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) indicated that student achievement was strongly influenced by socioeconomic status (SES) and race. Larger class size related to better composite and mathematics achievement, particularly in higher SES schools. Similarly, the presence of an instructional assistant predicted better achievement in reading, language, and the composite score only in higher SES schools. Analysis of race and class size showed that black students had better achievement in smaller classes, while white students did better in larger classes. HLM analyses of the student-teacher ratio showed pervasive SES and race effects. Better language, mathematics, and composite achievement was associated with classrooms that had Prime Time Assistants in higher SES schools.

Specifically it evaluates a reading intervention programme devised by educational psychologists and delivered by teaching assistants specially trained by a psychologist. The article assesses the extent to which a psychologist, working through school personnel, added value to the education process within participating schools, the nature of that value and the challenges that had to be overcome. Results showed significant group level improvements in word recognition abilities amongst readers with delayed reading, although the extent of these improvements varied according to school and age with older pupils benefiting more than younger ones. Girls gained more than boys, but this difference was not statistically significant. It was also demonstrated that the programme could be delivered to schools on a low budget including the training of school personnel and taught effectively by non-professional teachers with minimum disruption. It was concluded that the service-delivery approach taken was in keeping with the new expectations of professional educational psychologists and as such provides a useful model for others operating in a changing service context.

There were 51 participating schools and 2,241 pupils at randomization, and a total of 48 schools and 1,884 pupils were included in the final analysis (84% of the initial pupils at randomization). The trial took place between October 2014 and May 2015. Fifty-one schools were randomly assigned to either receive some version of the intervention or to act as a ""control"" school delivering business as usual. In the schools receiving the intervention, pupils were randomized to receive one of the following options  (1) ABRA, (2) the non-ICT intervention, and (3) standard literacy provision. The process evaluation involved observing sessions to understand a variety of factors in the intervention. These included an evaluation of which elements contributed to successful implementation, the perceptions and experiences of TAs and project leads, levels of pupil engagement, and the mechanisms behind the estimated impacts. This was an efficacy study, due to the involvement of the developer in the delivery of the program. Key conclusions of this report are  (1) The children who received ABRA, or its offline alternative were found to make two and three months' progress in literacy respectively compared to the children who received standard provision. This positive result would be unlikely to occur by chance  (2) For both ABRA and the offline alternative, the impact for children eligible for free school meals and children with below average pre-test outcomes was larger than for all pupils  (3) Successful implementation contributed to a well-designed and delivered training program which emphasized fidelity and consistency, enforced by ongoing support from the project team  (4) The process evaluation found that both the ICT and non-ICT interventions may be best delivered in groups of similar rather than mixed ability. The process evaluation also suggested minor changes to the intervention to make it more culturally relevant to British pupils, and to remove some repetition in the non-ICT program  and (5) Future research will examine whether ABRA or the non-ICT intervention can be successfully delivered at scale, and will look at longer-term impacts through assessing Key Stage 1 data from this trial.

Specifically, the current study addresses the paucity of research on PA training in preschool by testing the efficacy of a supplemental cohesive and explicit PA focused intervention that has been shown in previous studies to improve PA and alphabetic knowledge of at-risk kindergarteners. Second, the current study employs community-based paraeducator tutors as interventionists, and in so doing, extends other early K-1 reading research showing that paraeducators can deliver supplemental early reading interventions with a high degree of fidelity, particularly if the interventions are well scripted for non-certificated teachers' use. Finally, the authors chose to use a modified form of Interactive Book Reading as their comparison (control) condition to (a) control for supplemental instruction time and consistency, and (b) provide an alternative intervention approach appropriate for preschoolers. Indeed, studies support the benefit of interactive storybook reading for building emergent literacy skills  however, supplemental instruction that focuses on vocabulary acquisition has not, to date, been tested against explicit supplemental instruction in PA focused instruction with diverse (i.e., low socioeconomic, limited English proficiency) preschool children. Thus, this study also provides information regarding the relative impact of two approaches on preschoolers' PA and alphabetic and vocabulary knowledge. The primary research questions for the current study were  (a) does a supplemental PA focused intervention implemented by paraeducators have a direct, positive impact on at-risk preschool children's literacy outcomes?, and (b) does the intervention have a unique impact on children's outcomes, after controlling for pretest skill, classroom and home literacy environments, and treatment fidelity?

The lessons include the teaching of procedures (for example, counting on, counting up to, counting backwards, and counting in twos and in fives), mathematical signs (+, -, =) and mathematical language and concepts (such as more, less, and equal). Schools are advised to deliver 30 lessons of approximately half an hour, usually three times a week for ten weeks, and are encouraged to deliver additional sessions for pupils who need them. A classroom teacher colleague (the “Link Teacher”) is expected to meet the TA once a week to help them review and plan upcoming lessons, and provide feedback. 1stClass@Number was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial. 133 schools in South and West Yorkshire each nominated four children in Year 2 to participate in the project. The schools were then randomly assigned either to receive the intervention or to continue with their normal teaching in Year 2 and receive the opportunity to implement another ECC intervention with a different year group. The primary outcome for the trial was the Quantitative Reasoning Test, which focuses on number knowledge and mathematical problem solving, and the secondary outcome was performance in end-of-KS1 maths tests. A process evaluation collected additional data through observations, questionnaires, and phone interviews. The recruitment of schools began in September 2015 and the research completed in July 2017. The implementation of the intervention took place, approximately, between September 2016 and February 2017. Key",0.18,0.1301

There are two versions of the intervention  Switch-on Reading and Switch-on Reading and Writing. Both involve specially trained Teaching Assistants (TAs) delivering a tailored programme of literacy support in daily 20-minute sessions over a ten-week period. A previous EEF-funded evaluation of Switch-on had shown signs of promise in raising reading outcomes for Year 7 pupils, hence a larger scale effectiveness evaluation was conducted. Each of the 184 participating schools were randomly assigned to receive either Switch-on Reading, Switch-on Reading and Writing, or continue their usual practices of supporting pupils with reading difficulties (called ‘business as usual’ control). Between two and four TAs in each school were trained to deliver the interventions by a team of trainers who were distinct from the developers. TAs received 1.5 days training for Switch-on Reading, and 2.5 days for Switch-on Reading and Writing. Each TA worked with between two and four Year 3 pupils who had not met age-related expectations in literacy at the end of Key Stage 1, and who did not have a high level of special needs. In total, 999 pupils were involved in the trial. The primary outcome measure was the Hodder Group Reading Test 2A. The evaluation was conducted over the 2015/2016 academic year.

37671611,Ratcliff (2009),2009,"Reading First (RF) is the largest and the foremost federal initiative in improving reading achievement of struggling students in high-poverty, low performing schools in the U.S. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the RF program on the early literacy acquisition of young children. The primary research question was to investigate whether first grade students in RF schools would have better reading performances than those students in non-RF schools as measured by Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) subtests. The secondary research question was concerned with whether third and fourth grade students in RF schools performed better than those students in non-RF schools on statewide-mandated English Language Arts (ELA) assessment measures. A three-year longitudinal study was conducted to examine the ELA scores between 2006 and 2008. The data were obtained from six elementary schools in two rural school districts in Louisiana. The results showed that the first grade RF students had better performances in reading than the non-RF students at the beginning of the school year 2007–08. However, the differences in the adjusted means of the DIBELS subtests (Nonsense Word Fluency and Oral Reading Fluency) were not statistically significant at the end of the school year. Also, all of the first graders in both the RF and non-RF schools demonstrated significant gains in their reading skills. As the non-RF schools had adopted some of the RF components in their reading instruction, the findings indicated that the RF practices, which were based on scientifically based reading research (SBRR), helped produce positive reading outcomes in both RF and non-RF classrooms. The study also confirmed the efficacy of using well-trained paraprofessionals as intervention implementers. As for the statewide-mandated ELA assessment, the findings of the longitudinal study indicated that the students in the RF schools performed better than those in the non-RF schools on statewide-mandated ELA assessments between 2006 and 2008. The study provided evidence that the efforts of the RF program in implementing research-based reading instructional strategies into classrooms were successful. Recommendations for future studies and implications for practice were discussed. ",0.2725,0.1128

Schools receive three half-day training sessions for the Teaching Assistants (TAs) who deliver the intervention and their designated Catch Up® Literacy coordinator in their school, as well as materials to support the one-to-one sessions. The project was a randomised controlled trial. One hundred and fifty six primary schools were randomised to receive Catch Up® Literacy or to continue with their existing practices and act as Business as Usual (BaU) control schools. All the schools nominated up to 12 pupils in Years 4 or 5 (aged eight to ten years old) who were underperforming or struggling with literacy. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effect of Catch Up® Literacy over existing practice - ‘Business as Usual’ - for these pupils. The evaluation sought to answer the primary research question  what is the impact of Catch Up® Literacy on Year 4 and Year 5 pupils’ reading comprehension skills as measured by the Hodder Group Reading Test (HGRT).

38296668,Rutt (2014),2014,"Catch Up® Numeracy is a one to one intervention for learners who are struggling with numeracy. It consists of two 15-minute sessions per week, delivered by teaching assistants (TAs). The approach is based on research indicating that numeracy is not a single skill, but a composite of several component skills that are relatively discrete. The intervention breaks numeracy down into ten elements, including counting verbally, counting objects, word problems and estimation. Pupils are assessed on each component and instruction is targeted on those areas requiring development. In this evaluation, the intervention was run for 30 weeks and delivered to Year 2-6 pupils who were struggling with numeracy, as identified by TAs. The Catch Up Numeracy intervention was compared to a ‘business as usual’ control group and a ‘time equivalent’ intervention group, who received the same amount of one to one teaching by TAs, but did not use Catch Up Numeracy. Those TAs delivering Catch Up Numeracy were supplied with detailed session plans and received three half-day training sessions, led by Catch Up and Dr Ann Dowker of the University of Oxford. The project ran from September 2012 to July 2013. The overall effect size of Catch Up Numeracy in comparison to the ‘business as usual’ control group was +0.21, meaning the programme led to a noticeable improvement in numeracy outcomes. This effect size suggests that, on average, pupils receiving the interventions would make approximately three additional months of progress over the course of the year compared to pupils that did not. However, the ‘time equivalent’ group also showed similar significant gains (+0.27), suggesting the effect is likely to be a result of regular and sustained one to one teaching, rather than an intrinsic benefit of Catch Up Numeracy. The study demonstrates that one to one teaching with TAs is an effective strategy to increase numeracy skills in Year 2-6 pupils. Sub-group analysis did not identify any differential effects for pupil gender or eligibility for free school meals. The process evaluation indicated that most TAs valued Catch Up Numeracy and believed it had a positive impact on pupils’ confidence, engagement with learning and willingness to attempt numeracy problems.",0.21,0.1097
38296667,Rutt (2015),2015,"Catch Up Literacy is a structured one-to-one literacy intervention for pupils between the ages of 6 and 14 who are struggling to learn to read. It teaches pupils to blend phonemes (combine letter sounds into words), segment phonemes (separate words into letter sounds), and memorise particular words so they can be understood without needing to use phonics strategies to decode them. The intervention matches books to pupils according to their reading ability, which pupils then read to a teaching assistant (TA), so is intended to also support the development of their comprehension skills. In this evaluation, the intervention was delivered through two 15-minute sessions per week over 30 weeks at the transition from primary to secondary school, with a break for the summer holidays. Pupils were identified by their Year 6 teachers in their feeder primary schools as being struggling readers who were predicted to achieve below level 4b in reading. Each secondary school employed two part-time TAs to deliver the intervention in the last few weeks of Year 6 and after the pupils transitioned to secondary school.

Rime-based, phoneme-based, and ‘mixed’ (rime and phoneme-based) interventions were contrasted with controls receiving only the National Literacy Strategy. Phonological onset-rime and phoneme manipulation, spelling, and word and non-word reading were measured before and after the nine-week intervention. High rime neighbourhood (HRn) non-words (e.g. ‘dat’ – with many real word rime neighbours) and low rime neighbourhood (LRn) non-words (e.g. ‘tav’ with few real word neighbours) were used to evaluate onset-rime- or grapheme-phoneme-based decoding strategies. Results showed greater phonological onset-rime skills, lettersound knowledge and non-word reading skills in all LSA-taught intervention groups. There was no difference between the HRn and LRn non-words. The only reliable difference between the intervention groups was an advantage in phoneme blending for the rime-taught group. It was concluded that LSAs can enhance literacy development for 6-year-old poor readers. There appears to be no simple association between rime- or phoneme-based teaching intervention and changes in the size of unit used by children following interventions.",0.3572,0.2279
38296671,See (2018),2018,"Maths Counts aims to raise the attainment of children who struggle with basic mathematics at Key Stage 2. The intervention was developed by The Mead Community Primary School drawing on the principles of the Numbers Count programme developed by Every Child Counts at Edge Hill University. Maths Counts lessons last 30 minutes and take place at least three times a week for a minimum of ten weeks. Schools have access to an online tool that stores information about pupils’ progress, supports the planning of lesson objectives, and suggests activities and resources for each lesson. The first ten minutes of Maths Counts lessons focus on recall and reinforcement of prior learning, and the following 20 minutes introduce new knowledge and skills. The online tool suggests activities and resources to use, such as throwing and catching a soft football in order to count in sequenced steps or using coins to develop an understanding of money. In this project, schools selected pupils in Years 3 to 6 to participate in the intervention, prioritising pupils at risk of not achieving nationally expected levels, younger pupils, and pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium. The intervention was delivered on a one-to-one basis by teaching assistants. Schools were able to approach the timetabling of the intervention flexibly, so some lessons were scheduled during maths lessons while some took place elsewhere in the school day. Teaching assistants were supported by their schools’ maths leads (the school’s maths co-ordinator or specialist teacher). Support for delivery of the intervention was provided by the Mead Academy Trust project team. Before the intervention started, the project team provided two days of training for both maths leads and teaching assistants. The maths leads then delivered four further training sessions throughout the intervention to the teaching assistants in their school. After an initial development phase where the project team developed a website and the online tool, Maths Counts was evaluated by Durham University using a randomised controlled trial involving 291 pupils across 35 schools. Each school identified eight eligible pupils, four of whom were randomised to receive the intervention while the other four formed the ‘business as usual’ comparison group. The trial tested the impact of Maths Counts on maths attainment measured using the General Maths component of the CEM InCAS assessment.

It involves a high level of independent work by the student, with small groups of students supervised by a teacher or teaching assistant. Each ‘unit of sound’ (or phonic code) is introduced separately, then used in words, and then sentences. This evaluation assessed the reading ability of 786 Year 7 students in 45 schools.

It is targeted at children with relatively poor spoken language skills. Three sessions per week are delivered to groups of two to four children starting in the final term of nursery and continuing in the first two terms of reception in primary school. Children in primary school also attend an additional two 15-minute individual sessions per week. All sessions focus on listening, narrative and vocabulary skills. Work on phonological awareness is introduced in the final ten weeks. The intervention was developed by researchers from the University of York with funding from the Nuffield Foundation. The communications charity I CAN was enlisted to train teaching assistants and nursery staff to deliver the programme. This report evaluates the I CAN-led model for the 30-week programme described above and also a shorter 20-week version delivered only in reception year. The impact of these two programmes on the language skills of 350 children in 34 schools was tested using a randomised controlled trial design. Schools with attached nursery schools or nursery classes in Yorkshire and the South East were recruited to the trial in 2013. Children identified as having relatively low language skills were randomly allocated to the 30-week programme, the 20-week programme or standard provision. The qualitative fieldwork carried out as part of the project involved interviews with a total of 12 staff in 8 of the 34 participating schools. Key conclusions include  (1) The Nuffield Early Language Intervention had a positive impact on the language skills of children in the trial. This is true for both the more expensive, 30-week version, starting in nursery, and the 20-week version, delivered only in school  (2) Children receiving the 30-week version experienced the equivalent of about four months of additional progress, compared with about 2 months additional progress for the 20-week version. Both results are unlikely to have occurred by chance, though results for the 30-week version are more secure  (3) The evaluation did not provide reliable evidence that either version of the programme had a positive impact on children's word-level literacy skills  (4) Teaching assistants delivering the programme reported that they found it difficult to devote enough time to it, and that support from senior staff was required to protect the programme time  and (5) Staff in participating schools reported that the programme had a positive impact on children's language skills and confidence. They thought that the factors which contributed to this included the small-group format, the activities covered, and the focus on narrative and vocabulary work. ",0.27,0.1

However, no significant differences were found between the two tutored groups on any measure, suggesting that code-oriented tutoring for pairs of students is a viable alternative to the gold standard of individual instruction.

43090199,Vadasy (2008) TA,2008,"Many students have difficulty achieving reading fluency, and nearly half of fourth graders are not fluent readers in grade-level texts. Intensive and focused reading practice is recommended to help close the gap between students with poor fluency and their average reading peers. In this study, the ""Quick Reads"" fluency program was used as a supplemental fluency intervention for fourth and fifth graders with below-grade-level reading skills. ""Quick Reads"" prescribes a repeated reading procedure with short nonfiction texts written on grade-appropriate science and social science topics. Text characteristics are designed to promote word recognition skills. Students were randomly assigned to ""Quick Reads"" instruction that was implemented by trained paraeducator tutors with pairs of students for 30 minutes per day, 4 days per week, for 18 weeks. At posttest, ""Quick Reads"" students significantly outperformed classroom controls in vocabulary, word comprehension, and passage comprehension. Fluency rates for both treatment and control groups remained below grade level at posttest. (Contains 5 tables.)",0.4966,0.187

Students from 13 schools were randomly assigned to dyads  dyads were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. Schools were matched into treatment implementer groups (teachers or paraeducators) at study onset. Tutoring occurred during school hours for 15 weeks (M = 25.5 hr). Multilevel model results showed treatment students (n = 98) gained more than controls (n = 104) on measures of letter-sound knowledge (d = 0.41), fluency (d = 0.37-0.38), and comprehension (d = 0.30-0.31)  students tutored by teachers gained more than their paraeducator-tutored peers on word reading and fluency. Finally, dyads tutored with greater fidelity gained more in word reading and fluency  dyads that read more complex words in their texts gained less on letter-sounds, fluency, and comprehension.

37671589,Vadasy (2010),2010,"This study tested the efficacy of supplemental phonics instruction for 84 low-skilled language minority (LM) kindergarteners and 64 non-LM kindergarteners at 10 urban public schools. Paraeducators were trained to provide the 18-week (January-May) intervention. Students performing in the bottom half of their classroom language group (LM and non-LM) were randomly assigned either to individual supplemental instruction (treatment) or to classroom instruction only (control). Irrespective of their language status, treatment students (n = 67) significantly outperformed controls (n = 81) at posttest in alphabetics, word reading, spelling, passage reading fluency, and comprehension (average treatment d = 0.83)  nevertheless, LM students tended to have lower posttest performance than non-LM students (average LM d = -0.30) and were significantly less responsive to treatment on word reading. When we examined the contribution of classroom phonics time to student outcomes, we found that the treatment effect on spelling was greater for students in lower phonics classrooms, whereas the treatment effect on comprehension was greater for those in higher phonics classrooms. Finally, when we examined LM students alone, we found that pretest English receptive vocabulary positively predicted most posttests and interacted with treatment only on phonological awareness. In general, pretest vocabulary did not moderate kindergarten LM treatment response. (Contains 6 tables and 2 figures.) ",0.7665,0.2607

Participating students in the original study (n = 93 treatment, 92 control) received 20 weeks of small group instruction from paraeducator tutors during kindergarten. After attrition, students (n = 74 treatment, 66 control) were followed up midyear Grade 1 on English measures of proximal and distal vocabulary as well as word reading. At 6 months postintervention, the treatment benefits were maintained on all three outcomes, and furthermore, there was no evidence to suggest that early receptive vocabulary knowledge moderated longer term treatment effects. Results also showed kindergarten intervention year gains in proximal (i.e., root word) vocabulary uniquely predicted midyear Grade 1 distal vocabulary above and beyond kindergarten gains in distal vocabulary.
