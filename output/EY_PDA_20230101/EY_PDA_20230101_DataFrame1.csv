78361735,Battaglia (2019),2019,"It is known in the literature that fundamental motor skill acquisition is strongly associated with the development of neuromotor, cognitive, social, and emotional aspects in childhood. Unfortunately, in Italy, the physical education teacher is not included in the school\u0027s core personnel, and it is very hard to find a specific physical education program (PEP) that could improve preschool children\u0027s motor and cognitive status. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the quotient of gross motor development (QGMD) and pre-literacy skills concerning visual analysis and spatial orientation abilities changed after 16 weeks of PEP (2 h/week) in preschool children. We conducted a school-based non-randomized pilot trial. It involved 119 preschool children, clustered in a control group [CG, n = 29, body mass index (BMI)  16.90 ± 3.16 Kg/m2] and an intervention group (IG, n = 90, BMI  16.00 ± 1.75 kg/m2). Participants were assessed for literacy readiness, locomotor and object control skills before and after the experimental period. IG increased the locomotor, object-control skills and QGMD in response to PEP. As concerns the pre-literacy domain, no significant difference was found in visual analysis and spatial orientation skills between IG and CG groups. However, we detected improvements from baseline to post-test in IG children. In conclusion, this study contributes additional evidence suggesting how a PEP could affect not only motor skills, but also cognitive ones. Consistently with the growing research, interventions based on structured ludic-motor activities ensure health benefits for preschool children.

Purpose  The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as delivered by non-experts in a community-based setting. Methods  Staff from four community centers were trained to implement M2L. Two sites were evaluated using a quasi-experimental design and the remaining two were evaluated using a pre–post design. Movement and pre-literacy skills were assessed twice in all children. Implementation fidelity was assessed using a weekly checklist and through site-visits. Results  Thirty-one children (15 girls and 16 boys  age range 23–53 months) participated in the study. The results of the quasi-experimental study (n = 17) showed that there was an overall effect of the program on time 2 total gross motor scores (standardized beta = 1.3, p \u003c.05) but not pre-literacy scores, specifically print or alphabet knowledge. The pre–post design (n = 14) showed significant change over time for total gross motor scores (Cohen’s d = 1.78) and print knowledge (Cohen’s d = 1.76). Conclusions  Overall, the M2L program seems to have had a positive impact on participants when delivered in a community setting by trained, non-expert leaders.

METHODS  Fifty-four African-American preschool children from a low socioeconomic urban Head Start participated over 8 months. A 2-group, quasi-experimental design was used with one preschool site participating in the PA intervention and a second site participating as the control site. The PA program was designed to promote 300 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous PA academic lessons. Academic achievement related to early literacy and phonological awareness in the areas of rhyming and alliteration were assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 months. RESULTS  Over 8 months, rhyming significantly (p < .01) improved in the PA group (173±12%) compared with the controls (28 ± 8%) resulting in between group differences at 8 months (p < .01). Alliteration significantly (p < .01) improved in the PA group (52 ± 16%) compared with controls (13 ± 5%), resulting in between group differences at 8 months (p < .01). As minutes of exposure to moderate to vigorous PA increased, the change in picture naming (R2 = .35, p < .05), alliteration (R2 = .38, p < .05), and rhyming (R2 = .42, p < .05), increased.

52131682,Lazroe (1968),1968,"The Problem The four purposes of the study were  (l) to determine whether there was a significant difference between reading readiness test scores and perceptual test scores of kindergarten children given certain motor training and kindergarten children given regular training  (2) to determine whether there was a significant difference between reading readiness test scores and perceptual test scores of male and female kindergarten children given certain motor training  (3) to determine whether there was a significant difference in reading readiness test scores and perceptual test scores that was attributable to the age of kindergarten children given certain motor training  (4) to determine whether there was a significant difference in reading readiness test scores and perceptual test scores that was attributable to the mental age of kindergarten children given certain motor training. Procedure Children from sixteen kindergarten classes served as subjects for the study. Eight classes were randomly selected for the experimental program  the other eight classes served as control subjects. The experimental program consisted of prescribed gross motor activities for one-half hour daily over an eight-w eek period. Eight teachers participated. Each had one control and one experimental c lass randomly• assigned to a morning or afternoon session . The Pintner-Cunningham Primary Test was used to determine mental ages of the su b jects. The Perceptual Forms Test and Form A of the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were used as pre and post measurements of readiness for reading. Treatment of Data Scores earned on the pre- and post-tests of the Perceptual Forms Test and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were treated by analysis of covariance technique. Adjusted post-test means were given an F -test for statistical significance. Differences with .05 levels of significance were the basis for rejecting null hypotheses. Findings 1. On both criterion tests, the adjusted post-test means earned by the experimental group exceeded those earned by the control group. The differences were significant at the .05 lev el. The null hypothesis was rejected. 2. On both criterion tests, the differences between the adjusted post-test means earned by experimental boys and experimental girls were not significant at the .05 level. The null hypothesis was accepted. 3. On both criterion tests, the differences between the adjusted post-test means earned by experimental subjects above and experimental subjects below the median chronological age were not significant at the .05 level. The null hypothesis was accepted. 4. On both criterion tests, the adjusted post-test means earned by experimental subjects above the median mental age exceeded those earned by experimental subjects below the median mental age. The differences were significant at the .05 level. The null hypothesis was rejected. Conclusions Subject to the limitations of the study, it was concluded that the inclusion of a systematic program of gross motor activities in the curriculum of kindergarten children had the following effects  1. It significantly improved their readiness for reading. 2. It improved the reading readiness of boys and girls to a similar degree.","['Physical activity', 'EY_Physical development approaches']",NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" s ix te e n k in d e rg a rte n c l a s s e s[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['5', '6', '7']","['Page 23:\n[¬s]""C h ild re n in th e e x p e rim e n ta l group had a ran g e in c h ro n o lo g ic a l age from 60 to 75 m o n th s.

In this study, the learning effects of enacting words through whole-body movements (i.e., physical exercise) and part-body movements (i.e., gestures) were investigated in a foreign language vocabulary task. Participants were 111 preschool children of 15 childcare centers, who were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. Participants had to learn 14 Italian words in a 4-week teaching program. They were tested on their memory for the words during, directly after, and 6 weeks after the program. In the integrated physical exercise condition, children enacted the actions indicated by the words to be learned in physical exercises. In the non-integrated physical exercise condition children performed physical exercises at the same intensity, but unrelated to the learning task. In the gesturing condition, children enacted the actions indicated by the words to be learned by gesturing while remaining seated. In the conventional condition, children verbally repeated the words while remaining seated.

Speciﬁcally, children were asked\nhow much they liked the type of instruction (‘‘Did you like this game?”) and whether they would like\nto be taught this way in the future (‘‘Would you like to play it again in the future?”).

The programme involved an hour session once per week, over a period of seven months and consisted of different activities to improve body awareness, gross and fine motor skills, coordination, balance, bilateral integration, locomotor skills and spatial awareness. Both groups were evaluated with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2) and the Junior South African Individual Scale (JSAIS). Co-variance of analysis adjusted for pre-test differences showed that the programme contributed significantly to improvement in the fine motor, gross motor and total motor quotients, while two of the subscales of the JSAIS also showed significant improvement.

In addition to physical health, daily physical activity’s benefits on the brain and cognitive functioning have been extensively researched and provide support for incorporating more physical activity into physical education and the school day. This research investigated the effects of physical activity on academic achievement in kindergarten children across the 2008/09 school year. The main hypothesis examined in the study was whether children who participated in the Interactive Physical Activity Center (IPAC) would perform better academically than the control group on the Dibels Oral Reading Fluency, Retell Fluency, and Group Mathematics Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation (G-Made) achievement tests. To ensure that children in the experimental group were physically active, participation, changes in heart rate, activity scores and perceived exertion were examined across the year. Third, school attendance was examined to determine if the experimental group had fewer school absences than the control group. A longitudinal non-equivalent control group design was used to investigate the relationship between physical activity and academic achievement. To determine if the children were active in the IPAC, a one-way ANOVA examined changes in fitness variables. For the main question of the study concerning physical activity and academic achievement a two-way (Group X Time) ANOVA was used to compare academic progress of the experimental and control group. To assess school attendance of the two groups, a one-tailed independent samples t-test was used. Results demonstrated that kindergarten children who received the IPAC program increased their physical activity and reached the academic performance level of the control group by the end of the school year. The experimental group experienced a greater rate of improvement over time in three out of four of the Dibels subtests compared to the control group, and improved the same as the controls in the Growth Scale Value of the G-Made. These results expand previous research on the relationship between physical activity and academic performance in kindergarten children. Results of this study are important for administrators and teachers because quality physical activity experiences have the potential to impact cognitive, physical and academic outcomes in our schools.","['Physical activity', 'EY_Physical development approaches']",NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 88:\n[¬s]""the\ndata was preexisting and collected at a school by physical education specialists and high school\nstudents, thus ecologically valid but not controlled.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['5', '6']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 51:\n[¬s]""a rural public elementary school[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 51:\n[¬s]""a rural public elementary school[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 51:\n[¬s]""a rural public elementary school[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,,['No'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""whether children who participated in the Interactive\nPhysical Activity Center (IPAC) would perform better academically than the control group[¬e]""']",NA,,"Non-random, but matched","['Page 65:\n[¬s]""The control children were selected based on an individual match on gender, receiving\nspecial education and free and reduced lunch.[¬e]""']",NA,,Individual,"['Page 89:\n[¬s]""Only children who rode to school on the early\nbuses and five that were driven by their parents had the opportunity and/or motivation to\nparticipate.
