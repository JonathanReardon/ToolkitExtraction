The vocabulary instruction occurred after a story had been read, discussed, and con- cluded. Instruction took place after reading because the goal for teaching the words was to enhance general vocabulary develop- ment rather than comprehension of the story at hand.

The words feast, exhausted, and cautiously were selected from the story. The following explains the way feast was taught. The words in quotations are from the script that teachers received for the in- struction and illustrate how the information was provided to students. • First, the word was contextualized for its role in the story: “In the story, it said that the animals found the robbers’ ta- ble full of good things to eat, and so they had a feast.” • Next, the meaning of the word was ex- plained: “A feast is a big special meal with lots of delicious food.” • The children were asked to repeat the word so that they could create a pho- nological representation of it: “Say the word with me: feast.” • Examples in contexts other than the one used in the story were provided: “People usually have a feast on a hol- iday or to celebrate something special. We all have a feast on Thanksgiving Day.” • Children made judgments about ex- amples: “Which would be a feast: eat- ing an ice cream cone or eating at a big table full of all kinds of food? Why?” • Children were asked to construct their own examples: “If you wanted to eat a feast, what kinds of food would you want?” • The word’s phonological and mean- ing representations were reinforced: “What’s the word that means a big special meal?”""\n""In addition to introducing words in the manner shown above, teachers were asked to reinforce the words on subsequent days.[¬e]""', 'Page 8:\n[¬s]""For example, all teachers kept charts of the words from several stories posted on the wall.

The format in each day\'s teacher-directed literature activity was that of the DLTA, which provided a framework of ques- tion, prediction, and discussion both before and after a story reading. Teachers had a variety of activities suggested for sharing books with children from which they could choose. Some of these included: (a) reading for pleasure; (b) role playing and retelling stories; (c) repeated readings of favorite stories; (d) shared book experiences, which included children\'s participation in story readings; (e) using literature related to content area subjects; and (f) other ideas prepared by the teachers themselves. Activities included such events as preparing and eating bread and jam after listening to the story Bread and Jam for Frances (Hoban, 1960). Stories were told using puppets, feltboard characters, and props. Chil- dren were encouraged to model storytelling techniques used by the teacher during the recreational reading periods. 3. The recreational reading period. Children in the experimental group were free to select any materials from the Literacy Center (or library corner) during recre- ational reading. They were allowed to work either individually or with others. The area was designed to contain books, magazines, roll movies, story cassettes, Big Books, Viewmasters, feltboard characters, and puppets. Blank paper, mark- ers, glue, crayons, and pencils were available so children could create their own books. The purpose was to spend independent time involved with literature and literature related materials. 4. Summary of the day.

After a few sessions, children are asked to become more active participants in the book reading experience by becoming the storytellers. Appendix A provides the intervention schedule including the list of titles utilized in this study. The storybooks selected for use in this study were based on the recommendations of the creators of the Dialogic Reading technique (Whitehurst et al., 1994). The following is a description of key components of the Dialogic Reading technique followed by a description of prompts used during reading: Key Components Prompt. The children are prompted to say something about the book or page (for example, ""What\'s this? Tell me about this page?). Individual students are called on to offer comments about what \x93story\x94 is being told on a given page. Evaluate. Individual responses are evaluated by the teacher and the child is asked another question that will pinpoint specifics about the text. Expand. When a child offers a response, the teacher adds information to the response so that all the children can hear the details of the story. Repeat. The teacher repeats the child\x92s responses to make sure the other children hear the response. This also gives the child a chance to clarify his/her response if desired.[¬e]""', 'Page 61:\n[¬s]""Completion. This type of prompt is used when the teacher leaves a blank at the end of the sentence in order to let the child predict the final word.

This type of prompt requires asking questions about what occurred on a specific page or to summarize the main parts of a story. Recall questions can also be asked prior to reading a storybook. Open ended. This type of questioning involves asking students to describe what is happening in a specific picture in the book. This prompt works best with storybooks that contain richly detailed illustration. W prompts. These prompts simply refer to asking what, when, where, why, and how questions. Distancing.

This technique encourages active participation by the child in telling and re-telling the story.

Six to eight ofthe books listed in Table 2 were used in any particular classroom over the 6-week intervention. The books in Table 2 were chosen primarily because of their potential to support vocabulary growth. Each had illustrations that could serve as a basis for introducing new vocabulary to the child, and each could support a story narrative through the illustrations alone. ""\n""The selection of books for a particular classroom from those in Table 2 depended primarily on availability from the sup- plier.

The videotape contained two assign- ments, described in Table 3. The procedures for the adult in Table 3 were presented as a set of rules and were followed by taped vignettes of adult-child book reading that exemplified those rules. Afinalsection of the videotape consisted of vignettes of inappropriate adult-child book reading. Teachers were asked by the trainer to criticize the readers in the vignettes in terms of the rules of dialogic reading and to indicate what the adult reader should have done differently in response to the child. Following the videotape, the trainer engaged in role play with the teach- ers being trained, which involved presenting various examples of child behavior and giving the teacher feedback on her use ofthe dialogic read- ing rules. The whole training sequence took about 30 min per trainee for Part 1 and 20 min for Part 2. Part 1 and Part 2 training were sepa- rated by 3 weeks.
