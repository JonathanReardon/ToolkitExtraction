Awareness about reading was measured with the Index of Reading Awareness, a group-administered task that was derived from individual interview data in a previous study (Paris & Ja- cobs, 1984). Children answered 22 multiple-choice questions that as- sessed their awareness and understanding of the variables influencing reading. This included their knowledge of task goals, the planful use of strategies, and the evaluation of their comprehension. ,4n example of an item concerning the planful use of strategies is “What do you do if you don’t know what a whole sentence means’?” The possible choices (with their accompanying point values) were (a) read it again ( I ), (b) sound out all of the words (0). and (c) think about the other sentences in the para- graph (2). Children’s awareness of different purposes for reading accom- panied by differential strategies was assessed with the following type of question  “If you are reading for a test. which would help you the most?” The possible responses were (a) read the story as many times as possible (I), (b) talk about it with somebody to make sure you understand it (2). and (c) say the sentences over and over (0). The students were told that this was not a test and were instructed to choose the response that best described what they thought about reading. The items and alternatives were read aloud to students as they read silently. The same X-item ver- sion was given to third and fifth graders at both the pretests and post- tests.
