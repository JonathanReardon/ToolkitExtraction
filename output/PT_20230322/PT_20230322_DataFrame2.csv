Since teachers strongly rely on their beliefs and knowledge about instruction when adding new\npractices to their teaching repertoire (Borko & Putnam, 1996), Hacker and Tenent (2002) argued that researchers have to consider\nthat teachers, too, need to take ownership of their learning by constructing their own understanding of new curricula and methods\nusing their prior knowledge.
