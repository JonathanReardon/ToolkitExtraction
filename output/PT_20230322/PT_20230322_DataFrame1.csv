74069942,Alegre (2019),2019,This study reports the academic benefits of peer tutoring in algebra for middle school students. A total of 380 students enrolled in grades 7th and 8th participated in the study. Two peer tutoring sessions took place during each week (10 weeks). Interactions between peers lasted 20 to 25 minutes for each session. The typology of tutoring was fixed and same-age. A pretest posttest with control group design was used. Statistical significant improvements were reported in the academic achievement variable after the implementation of the peer tutoring program for 7th and 8th grade courses separately and altogether. Over 87% of the students in the experimental group improved their marks. The overall effect size for the experience was reported to be medium (Hedge’s g = 0.48). The main conclusion of this study is that fixed and same-age peer tutoring in algebra may be very beneficial for middle school students.,['Peer tutoring'],NA,,['MT_2023 (in progress)'],"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['Spain'],,['Middle school'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""a public middle-school[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Participants in the study were accessed through convenience sampling (non-\nprobabilistic sampling technique) as they were selected only because they were conveniently\navailable to the researchers (Altmann, 1974).

The thesis reports an investigation using a factorial design of the effects of incorporating peer and resource-led learning into teacher pedagogies.\r\nIt examined the effects of using peer tutoring and manipulatives, both separately and together, on the mathematical education of fourth grade students (aged 10 and 11) in elementary schools in AlAhsa city in Saudi Arabia, with regard to (a) attainment in mathematics, (b) attitudes towards learning mathematics, (c) attitudes towards learning partners and (d) the students’ social relationships. Twenty-four classes were randomly chosen and assigned to different groups. One control group of six classes was taught as usual, and six classes were assigned to each of three experimental groups  that is, six each to the manipulatives group, the peer tutoring group and the group using peer tutoring and manipulatives together.

The study examined, through qualitative and quantitative analysis, the benefits that CWPT has on student success, compared to traditional teaching. The procedure compared two seventh-grade classes with similar abilities. One class was taught using traditional, teacher-led methodology, while the other class utilized a CWPT model. A pre and post-test, student survey and an observational journal were incorporated to evaluate the effectiveness of the study. The results of the study indicated that CWPT is effective in enhancing student motivation and utilizes tools that promote comprehension, which are not applicable in a traditional classroom.

The PASS program uses a strategy-based model of teaching higher-order cognitive strategies to adolescents, using a scaffolding approach. The first objective of the study was to examine whether students in the PASS program would outperform control participants on measures of grades, writing skills, numerical operations, and self-ratings of metacognitive awareness, strategy use, motivation/effort and academic self-concept using a randomized experimental design. The results indicated that the PASS students showed a significant improvement in their writing skills compared to control participants by the end of the study, while other areas, such as overall grades, did not show an improvement. The second objective of the study was to explore process factors, such as students' motivation and the relationship between tutor and tutee, to determine whether certain conditions, traits, skills or dynamics were more conducive to academic gains than others. Overall, there were characteristics of both tutors and tutees that predicted better outcomes for the tutees involved in the PASS study. First, tutors who were on task according to their tutees had tutees who made more academic gains. Second, tutees with higher metacognitive skills were more likely to have ii bonded with their tutors and were the students who asked more questions during tutoring. Additionally, students who made gains in their metacognitive skills and who had higher self-ratings of motivation and effort, rated themselves as making gains in their academic abilities by the end of the program.

74069988,Pastore (2008),2008,"Literacy is an important life skill which must be mastered in order to actively participate in today’s society. The ability to read is arguably the most important aspect of literacy skills and as such it transcends subject areas. In consequence of this, literacy has become a major focal point of today's educational system. In classrooms throughout America, tutoring is implemented as a form of supplemental instruction. This is done under the assumption that tutoring truly is an effective means of increasing student achievement in the core curricular areas. As current research suggests that tutoring is an effective means of increasing students' skills in the area of literacy, particularly reading comprehension, this research study explores that truth. Specific focus is given to identifying which format, direct tutoring or peer tutoring, is more effective for increasing student achievement within the realm of reading comprehension of middle school-aged students. This study was conducted in an urban school district where less than half of the student population tests at the proficiency level on the 6th grade New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Exam. The heterogeneous sample group of twenty sixth grade students was randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups  a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group. The students for the two groups were pulled from all three of the ability-grouped sixth grade homerooms with a representative number of male and female students to eliminate gender as a possible construct. Peer tutors were selected and trained on the procedures and routines of tutoring. The study was conducted over eight, one-hour tutoring sessions. Research data includes pre and post-test assessments, student journals, and observational notes regarding student levels of engagement, on-task behavior, and their active participation in the tutoring session. Research data reports that while students in both groups increased in reading comprehension literacy, students in the peer tutoring group had a greater change overall. This suggests that peer tutoring may be more effective in increasing the reading comprehension achievement of middle school students in urban populations.",['Peer tutoring'],NA,,['MT_2023 (in progress)'],Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA, 6th grade ,,High ecological validity,NA,"researcher was a teacher in school, took place in the same school environment",,"['11', '12']",NA,6th grade,,1,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""an urban middle school,[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""an urban middle school,[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""an urban middle school[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,3,NA,,3,NA,,3,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""The students in my two groups were pulled from all three of the\nability-grouped sixth grade homerooms.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""randomly assigned to one of two\nexperimental groups; a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group.[¬e]""']",NA,,Individual,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""The students in my two groups were pulled from all three of the\nability-grouped sixth grade homerooms.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""sixth grade students·,\nattending an urban middle school, who were randomly assigned to one of two\nexperimental groups[¬e]""']",NA,,Yes,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""This study included a heterogeneous group of twenty sixth grade students·,\nattending an urban middle school, who were randomly assigned to one of two\nexperimental groups; a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group.

74070007,Udaka (2009),2009,"There are certain ways of reading to young children that are more effective than others in increasing language, vocabulary, and building early literacy skills. Dialogic reading is a method to enhance shared book reading by providing a context for dialogue and interaction between the adult and the child. Dialogic reading has been shown to have positive effects on young childrens’ early literacy and language skills. Thus far, parents and teachers have used these techniques in the home and school in one-on-one or small group settings. However, results have been variable due to inconsistent implementation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of implementing dialogic reading techniques in a preschool setting via cross age tutoring by fifth grade students. Students in preschool and fifth grade were recruited from a school in Eastern Maryland. Fifth graders served as tutors and were trained to use dialogic reading techniques with preschool students in the same school. The tutoring dyads met three times a week for 30 minutes for 8 weeks. Preschoolers’ receptive and expressive language skills as well as their readiness to begin school were assessed before and after the intervention, and fifth grader’s attitudes towards reading prior to and after the intervention were measured. Data on the preschool students were analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance and the results indicated significant changes in receptive, expressive and school readiness in comparison to the control group with medium to large effect sizes (.402 - .640). Furthermore, data on tutor attitudes toward reading were analyzed using two-sample paired t-tests. Results revealed an increase in positive attitudes toward recreational reading, with an effect size of .653, and an increase in general reading attitudes with an effect size of .421.

The study examines the educational benefits of explicit reading strategies instruction, followed by practice in (a) teacher-led whole-class activities (STRAT), (b) reciprocal same-age (STRAT + SA), or (c) cross-age peer tutoring activities (STRAT + CA) on fifth graders' reading comprehension achievement. Sample. Twenty-two fifth-grade teachers and their 454 students from 19 different schools throughout Flanders (Belgium) participated. Method. A quasi-experimental pretest post-test retention test design was used with three experimental (STRAT, STRAT + SA, and STRAT + CA) and a matched control group. The experimental interventions were implemented during an entire school year. Results.

Additionally, the framework allows researchers to implement comparison conditions by making it easier to vary single factors of the adaptive intervention. We evaluated CTRL by designing adaptive and fixed support for a peer tutoring setting, and instantiating the framework using those two collaborative scenarios and an individual tutoring scenario. As part of the implementation, we integrated pre-existing components from the Cognitive Tutor Algebra (CTA) with custom-built components. The three conditions were then compared in a controlled classroom study, and the results helped us to contribute to learning sciences research in peer tutoring.

SAMPLE A total of 597 students (282 males) from 12 classes in a secondary school were recruited to participate in the study as part of their psychology course. METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to one of six conditions formed by a 2 (teaching expectancy vs. testing expectancy) × 3 (peer teaching vs. imagined teaching vs. no teaching) between-subjects design. Their immediate and delayed comprehension tests, motivation, and perceived difficulty were measured as dependent variables. RESULTS Imagined teaching enhanced both immediate and delayed comprehension, but peer teaching only enhanced immediate comprehension.

Forty-six students with the lowest scores on a standardized test of reading comprehension in seven eighth-grade classes participated in the study. Following 3 hours of instruction in reciprocal teaching procedures, four classroom teachers and two support teachers ran eight reciprocal teaching groups. Four of these groups, 20 students in all, were exposed to between 12 and 16 reciprocal teaching sessions, while 15 students in the other four groups received between six and eight sessions. The remaining 11 students served as a no-treatment comparison group. Pre- and posttest scores on the standardized test served as the dependent measure. Significant gains were observed with students in the extended program, with no significant differences observed between the short program and comparison groups.
