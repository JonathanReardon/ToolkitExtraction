The pedagogies explored included the use of manipulatives and peer learning. The thesis reports an investigation using a factorial design of the effects of incorporating peer and resource-led learning into teacher pedagogies.\r\nIt examined the effects of using peer tutoring and manipulatives, both separately and together, on the mathematical education of fourth grade students (aged 10 and 11) in elementary schools in AlAhsa city in Saudi Arabia, with regard to (a) attainment in mathematics, (b) attitudes towards learning mathematics, (c) attitudes towards learning partners and (d) the students’ social relationships. Twenty-four classes were randomly chosen and assigned to different groups. One control group of six classes was taught as usual, and six classes were assigned to each of three experimental groups  that is, six each to the manipulatives group, the peer tutoring group and the group using peer tutoring and manipulatives together. Each experimental group undertook a 12-week programme in the fractions and decimals sections of the fourth grade elementary school mathematics curriculum. The research methods and materials were initially developed during a pilot study involving 8 classes of fourth grade students (aged 10 and 11) in elementary schools in AlAhsa city.\r\nThe results of this RCT suggested that the use of peer tutoring and manipulatives, separately and together, significantly affected the mathematical education of those students regarding their attainment, attitudes towards learning mathematics, attitudes towards their learning partners and social relationships.

The PASS program uses a strategy-based model of teaching higher-order cognitive strategies to adolescents, using a scaffolding approach. The first objective of the study was to examine whether students in the PASS program would outperform control participants on measures of grades, writing skills, numerical operations, and self-ratings of metacognitive awareness, strategy use, motivation/effort and academic self-concept using a randomized experimental design. The results indicated that the PASS students showed a significant improvement in their writing skills compared to control participants by the end of the study, while other areas, such as overall grades, did not show an improvement. The second objective of the study was to explore process factors, such as students' motivation and the relationship between tutor and tutee, to determine whether certain conditions, traits, skills or dynamics were more conducive to academic gains than others. Overall, there were characteristics of both tutors and tutees that predicted better outcomes for the tutees involved in the PASS study.

Second, tutees with higher metacognitive skills were more likely to have ii bonded with their tutors and were the students who asked more questions during tutoring.

The ability to read is arguably the most important aspect of literacy skills and as such it transcends subject areas. In consequence of this, literacy has become a major focal point of today's educational system. In classrooms throughout America, tutoring is implemented as a form of supplemental instruction. This is done under the assumption that tutoring truly is an effective means of increasing student achievement in the core curricular areas. As current research suggests that tutoring is an effective means of increasing students' skills in the area of literacy, particularly reading comprehension, this research study explores that truth. Specific focus is given to identifying which format, direct tutoring or peer tutoring, is more effective for increasing student achievement within the realm of reading comprehension of middle school-aged students. This study was conducted in an urban school district where less than half of the student population tests at the proficiency level on the 6th grade New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Exam. The heterogeneous sample group of twenty sixth grade students was randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups  a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group. The students for the two groups were pulled from all three of the ability-grouped sixth grade homerooms with a representative number of male and female students to eliminate gender as a possible construct. Peer tutors were selected and trained on the procedures and routines of tutoring. The study was conducted over eight, one-hour tutoring sessions. Research data includes pre and post-test assessments, student journals, and observational notes regarding student levels of engagement, on-task behavior, and their active participation in the tutoring session. Research data reports that while students in both groups increased in reading comprehension literacy, students in the peer tutoring group had a greater change overall. This suggests that peer tutoring may be more effective in increasing the reading comprehension achievement of middle school students in urban populations.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //explore.openalex.org/works/W657118918,NA,NA,State University of New York College

Lessons that targeted writing letters focused on formation and fluency, and lessons that targeted spelling focused on teaching letter sound correspondence for spelling decodable words and recognition and spelling practice for sight words. Results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the PAWS participants and the control children on the alphabet fluency and essay post-test measures. Thus preliminary results indicate that PAWS instruction helped children, on average, improve early writing skills. Directions for future research are discussed.",30,1,25-50,https //doi.org/10.1007/s11145-016-9661-9,https //eric.ed.gov/?id=ED575152,NA,NA,NA

Dialogic reading is a method to enhance shared book reading by providing a context for dialogue and interaction between the adult and the child. Dialogic reading has been shown to have positive effects on young childrens’ early literacy and language skills. Thus far, parents and teachers have used these techniques in the home and school in one-on-one or small group settings. However, results have been variable due to inconsistent implementation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of implementing dialogic reading techniques in a preschool setting via cross age tutoring by fifth grade students. Students in preschool and fifth grade were recruited from a school in Eastern Maryland. Fifth graders served as tutors and were trained to use dialogic reading techniques with preschool students in the same school. The tutoring dyads met three times a week for 30 minutes for 8 weeks. Preschoolers’ receptive and expressive language skills as well as their readiness to begin school were assessed before and after the intervention, and fifth grader’s attitudes towards reading prior to and after the intervention were measured.

We have extended the Cognitive Tutor Algebra, a successful intelligent tutoring system for individual learning, with a reciprocal peer tutoring activity designed to increase conceptual learning. While using our peer tutoring environment, students take on tutor and tutee roles, and engage in both problem-solving actions and dialogue. In a classroom study, we randomly assigned 62 participants to three conditions (adaptive assistance to peer tutoring, fixed assistance to peer tutoring, and individual learning). All conditions yielded significant learning gains, but there were no differences between conditions in final outcomes. There were significant process differences, however. We assessed student interaction using problem-solving information logged by the intelligent tutoring system and collaborative dialogue captured in a chat window. Our analysis integrated these multiple data sources in order to better understand how collaborative dialogue and problem-solving actions might lead to conceptual learning. This rich data sheds light on how students benefitted from the reciprocal peer tutoring activity  Peer tutors learned when they reflected on tutee problem-solving actions, and tutees learned when the tutor\u0027s help was responsive to those actions.",04,03,221-251,https //doi.org/10.1142/S179320680900074X,https //www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S179320680900074X,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we introduce the Collaborative Tutoring Research Lab (CTRL), a research-oriented framework for adaptive collaborative learning support that enables researchers to combine different types of adaptive support, particularly by using domain-specific models as input to domain-general components in order to create more complex tutoring functionality. Additionally, the framework allows researchers to implement comparison conditions by making it easier to vary single factors of the adaptive intervention. We evaluated CTRL by designing adaptive and fixed support for a peer tutoring setting, and instantiating the framework using those two collaborative scenarios and an individual tutoring scenario. As part of the implementation, we integrated pre-existing components from the Cognitive Tutor Algebra (CTA) with custom-built components. The three conditions were then compared in a controlled classroom study, and the results helped us to contribute to learning sciences research in peer tutoring. CTRL can be generalized to other collaborative scenarios, but the ease of implementation relates to the complexity of the existing components used. CTRL as a framework has yielded a full implementation of an adaptive support system and a controlled evaluation in the classroom.",19,5,387-431,https //doi.org/10.1007/s11257-009-9069-1,https //link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-009-9069-1,NA,NA,NA

These studies provide insufficient evidence regarding its effect on learners\u0027 delayed comprehension. Moreover, the relative superiority of teaching a peer face to face compared to teaching an imagined peer lacks empirical support. AIMS The purpose of the study was to investigate the interactivity of teaching by comparing peer teaching to imagined teaching, as well as enhancing the generalizability of the teaching expectancy effect by testing it in a secondary school environment. SAMPLE A total of 597 students (282 males) from 12 classes in a secondary school were recruited to participate in the study as part of their psychology course. METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to one of six conditions formed by a 2 (teaching expectancy vs. testing expectancy) × 3 (peer teaching vs. imagined teaching vs. no teaching) between-subjects design. Their immediate and delayed comprehension tests, motivation, and perceived difficulty were measured as dependent variables. RESULTS Imagined teaching enhanced both immediate and delayed comprehension, but peer teaching only enhanced immediate comprehension. Moreover, the effects of imagined teaching on perceived difficulty and motivation were dependent upon teaching expectancy or testing expectancy. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide empirical evidence to the existing theoretical frameworks, but caution should be taken when applying imagined teaching in practice.",91,4,1275-1290,https //doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12416,https //eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1315300,NA,NA,NA
