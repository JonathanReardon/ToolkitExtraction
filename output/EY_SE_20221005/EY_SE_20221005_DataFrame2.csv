Collecting\nthese data not only served to promote treatment integrity but\nalso to inform the ongoing cultural adaptation of the curricula\nand the week-to-week supervision of the intervention’s deliv-\nery. Two procedures were used to collect fidelity data from\nMaking Choices staff. First, program specialists filled out treat-\nment integrity forms after each intervention session. This form\nused a combination of closed- and open-ended questions to\nassess the extent to which lessons were implemented, to iden-\ntify the factors that influenced whether the lesson objectives\nwere achieved, and to gather recommendations for improving\nthe lessons. These data were used in weekly supervisory\nsessions to monitor implementation. In addition, the weekly\n45-min supervisory sessions also focused on helping program\nspecialists anticipate issues and adapt the subsequent lesson\ncontent to promote cultural congruence.\nAs needs for adaptation were identified, modifications were\nmade systematically, ensuring that changes did not compro-\nmise the core features of the SIP intervention. For example, a\ncentral analogy in the SIP skill-building sequence of one unit\ninvolved a turtle. However, many children in the sample lived\nin an urban environment and had never seen a turtle. Therefore,\nthe lesson was postponed until a turtle could be brought into the\nclassroom, the characteristics of a turtle explained to the chil-\ndren, and the children had a chance to observe the turtle. Les-\nson content was not changed, but the activities were augmented\nto improve cultural congruence. Similarly, one site made adap-\ntations to the lessons to account for intracultural variation. For\nexample, lessons that included illustrations or stories viewed as\nculturally relevant to Mexico were adapted by preschool staff,\nprogram staff, and the supervisor for participants from Colum-\nbia, Ecuador, Honduras, and Peru. Throughout this adaptation\nprocess, lessons maintained the core SIP focus but images and\nstories were fit to participants’ cultures of origin.\nFor the Strong Families program, the lesson content was\nadapted similarly to represent the experiences, cultural idioms,[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""and colloquialisms of the participants.
