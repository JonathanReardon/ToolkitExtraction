74069942,Alegre (2019),2019,This study reports the academic benefits of peer tutoring in algebra for middle school students. A total of 380 students enrolled in grades 7th and 8th participated in the study. Two peer tutoring sessions took place during each week (10 weeks). Interactions between peers lasted 20 to 25 minutes for each session. The typology of tutoring was fixed and same-age. A pretest posttest with control group design was used. Statistical significant improvements were reported in the academic achievement variable after the implementation of the peer tutoring program for 7th and 8th grade courses separately and altogether. Over 87% of the students in the experimental group improved their marks. The overall effect size for the experience was reported to be medium (Hedge’s g = 0.48). The main conclusion of this study is that fixed and same-age peer tutoring in algebra may be very beneficial for middle school students.,['Peer tutoring'],NA,,['MT_2023 (in progress)'],"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['Spain'],,['Middle school'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""a public middle-school[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Participants in the study were accessed through convenience sampling (non-\nprobabilistic sampling technique) as they were selected only because they were conveniently\navailable to the researchers (Altmann, 1974).

The thesis reports an investigation using a factorial design of the effects of incorporating peer and resource-led learning into teacher pedagogies.\r\nIt examined the effects of using peer tutoring and manipulatives, both separately and together, on the mathematical education of fourth grade students (aged 10 and 11) in elementary schools in AlAhsa city in Saudi Arabia, with regard to (a) attainment in mathematics, (b) attitudes towards learning mathematics, (c) attitudes towards learning partners and (d) the students’ social relationships. Twenty-four classes were randomly chosen and assigned to different groups. One control group of six classes was taught as usual, and six classes were assigned to each of three experimental groups  that is, six each to the manipulatives group, the peer tutoring group and the group using peer tutoring and manipulatives together. Each experimental group undertook a 12-week programme in the fractions and decimals sections of the fourth grade elementary school mathematics curriculum.

Findings showed that there were nine session plans with learning activities developed with the integration of cooperative and contextualized learning approaches.

The study examined, through qualitative and quantitative analysis, the benefits that CWPT has on student success, compared to traditional teaching. The procedure compared two seventh-grade classes with similar abilities. One class was taught using traditional, teacher-led methodology, while the other class utilized a CWPT model. A pre and post-test, student survey and an observational journal were incorporated to evaluate the effectiveness of the study. The results of the study indicated that CWPT is effective in enhancing student motivation and utilizes tools that promote comprehension, which are not applicable in a traditional classroom.

74069988,Pastore (2008),2008,"Literacy is an important life skill which must be mastered in order to actively participate in today’s society. The ability to read is arguably the most important aspect of literacy skills and as such it transcends subject areas. In consequence of this, literacy has become a major focal point of today's educational system. In classrooms throughout America, tutoring is implemented as a form of supplemental instruction. This is done under the assumption that tutoring truly is an effective means of increasing student achievement in the core curricular areas. As current research suggests that tutoring is an effective means of increasing students' skills in the area of literacy, particularly reading comprehension, this research study explores that truth. Specific focus is given to identifying which format, direct tutoring or peer tutoring, is more effective for increasing student achievement within the realm of reading comprehension of middle school-aged students. This study was conducted in an urban school district where less than half of the student population tests at the proficiency level on the 6th grade New York State English Language Arts (ELA) Exam. The heterogeneous sample group of twenty sixth grade students was randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups  a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group. The students for the two groups were pulled from all three of the ability-grouped sixth grade homerooms with a representative number of male and female students to eliminate gender as a possible construct. Peer tutors were selected and trained on the procedures and routines of tutoring. The study was conducted over eight, one-hour tutoring sessions. Research data includes pre and post-test assessments, student journals, and observational notes regarding student levels of engagement, on-task behavior, and their active participation in the tutoring session. Research data reports that while students in both groups increased in reading comprehension literacy, students in the peer tutoring group had a greater change overall. This suggests that peer tutoring may be more effective in increasing the reading comprehension achievement of middle school students in urban populations.",['Peer tutoring'],NA,,['MT_2023 (in progress)'],Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,"['11', '12']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""an urban middle school,[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""an urban middle school,[¬e]""']",,1,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""an urban middle school[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,3,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""The students in my two groups were pulled from all three of the\nability-grouped sixth grade homerooms.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""randomly assigned to one of two\nexperimental groups; a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group.[¬e]""']",NA,,Individual,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""The students in my two groups were pulled from all three of the\nability-grouped sixth grade homerooms.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""sixth grade students·,\nattending an urban middle school, who were randomly assigned to one of two\nexperimental groups[¬e]""']",NA,,Yes,"['Page 33:\n[¬s]""This study included a heterogeneous group of twenty sixth grade students·,\nattending an urban middle school, who were randomly assigned to one of two\nexperimental groups; a peer tutoring group and a direct tutoring group.

Research reveals that explicit reading strategies instruction and engaging students in interaction about texts promote students' reading comprehension ability.

The study examines the educational benefits of explicit reading strategies instruction, followed by practice in (a) teacher-led whole-class activities (STRAT), (b) reciprocal same-age (STRAT + SA), or (c) cross-age peer tutoring activities (STRAT + CA) on fifth graders' reading comprehension achievement. Sample. Twenty-two fifth-grade teachers and their 454 students from 19 different schools throughout Flanders (Belgium) participated. Method. A quasi-experimental pretest post-test retention test design was used with three experimental (STRAT, STRAT + SA, and STRAT + CA) and a matched control group. The experimental interventions were implemented during an entire school year. Results. Multilevel analysis revealed that the STRAT and STRAT + CA condition made a significantly larger pretest to retention test progress than the control group. The significant major progress was especially situated from pretest to post-test, during which the intervention took place. Concerning the STRAT + SA condition no significant differences with regard to the control group were detected. Pairwise comparisons of the experimental conditions indicated that the STRAT + CA condition's progress from pretest to retention test also exceeded the STRAT + SA condition's advancement significantly.
