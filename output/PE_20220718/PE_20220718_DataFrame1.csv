42025124,Arnold (1996),1996,"The purpose of the study was to determine if direct parental training would effect third, fourth, and fifth grade students' academic performance in the area of mathematics. Mathematics is an important subject in elementary education. The major emphasis of the activities involved was on reinforcing computational skills. Those interested in the formal education of students, both in the K-12 arena and also teacher education programs at universities should find the analysis of the effects of parent-school involvement an important area of study. Parents who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to one of three study groups. Treatment Group A consisted of direct parental training in the area of mathematical activities concentrating on computational skills which were played at home with their children. Treatment Group B only received the mathematical activities which were played at home with their children. Group C was the Control Group. Based upon this research, parental involvement does not make a difference with third and fifth grade students' mathematical achievement test scores. There was however, significance with the fourth grade students' mathematical achievement test scores. Further analysis revealed that at the third grade, those students who returned log books scored significantly higher on the mathematic achievement test scores than those students who did not return the log books. There was no significance found for the fourth and fifth grades with respect to the log books. Additionally, at the third grade, females played more of the mathematical activities than did the males. At the fourth grade, the males played more of the mathematical activities than the females, at the fifth grade, the males played approximately twice as many mathematical activities as the females.

The subjects were 77 first grade children enrolled in an urban elementary school in the South and their parents. The school system placed children in one of four first grade classrooms in the fall, 1987, based on their achievement scores in reading and math. Mean class achievement scores and teacher experiences were used to designate two classes as experimental and two as comparison. Parents of children in the experimental classes received a group meeting at the beginning of the year, another meeting in the middle of the year, and daily parent-aided homework assignments listing the objective and learning activity from October, 1987 to April, 1988. The comparison parents received two group meetings, with different content, and no systematic parent-aided homework. Analysis of Covariance and Sheffe's procedure failed to reject null hypotheses 1 and 2 indicating that no significant differences existed in achievement scores received in reading and math on the GCRT between students who had received the parent/homework intervention program and those who had not. Computation of Pearson's r yielded moderate positive correlations allowing the rejection of null hypotheses 3 and 4, thus, revealing a positive correlation did exist between the number of reading and math parent/homework intervention assignments completed and GCRT reading and math achievement scores. The moderate positive correlations found between achievement scores and amount of homework completed along with the positive responses from parents and students indicated that homework can be effectively used with primary age children when parent participation is included in the homework process. The study demonstrated that (1) homework will be completed by primary age students if it is well-organized and easy to locate  (2) completion of parent-aided homework is moderately related to academic achievement  and (3) the parent/homework intervention program improved parent's understanding of their child's educational strengths and weaknesses, relations with the school, and the overall climate of parent-teacher relations.",['Parental engagement'],NA,,NA,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Home'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7']",NA,NA,,1,NA,,1,NA,,1,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,2,NA,,2,NA,,4,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 59:\n[¬s]""The four intact first grade classes at Rainbow\nwere classified as either experimental (treatment)\ngroup (El or E2) or comparison (nontreatment) group (C3\nor C4).[¬e]""']",NA,,"Non-random, but matched","['Page 59:\n[¬s]""The four intact first grade classes at Rainbow\nwere classified as either experimental (treatment)\ngroup (El or E2) or comparison (nontreatment) group (C3\nor C4).

42024853,Barkley (2000),2000,"Annual screenings of preschool children at kindergarten registration identified 158 children having high levels of aggressive, hyperactive, impulsive, and inattentive behavior. These 'disruptive' children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year  no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains  parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother-child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children. Even so, most treatment effects were specific to the school environment and did not affect achievement skills.

42059739,Beach (2004),2004,"Although there is considerable evidence linking phonological awareness to early reading performance, few research studies have been conducted to measure early interventions of explicit phonological awareness instruction, including parents as teachers, with 4- and 5-year-old prekindergarten children  among those that have been completed, research methods have often been seriously flawed. The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.","['Parental engagement', 'Phonics', 'Summer schools']",NA,,NA,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],"['Page 55:\n[¬s]""The independent variable in this study was the LCSD Kindergarten\nReadiness Summer Program.

The project was also intended to provide indirect instruction to these students' parents and other family members who could facilitate their educational achievement. Participants were 124 students and their parents from a small California school district with a population that is primarily Spanish speaking. The students were in eight bilingual classes in grades 1 through 3. Only 61 families were actually involved in project activities  the remaining families served as a control group. Teachers encouraged the students to take home literature backpacks, each containing a cassette player, audiotape, and Spanish literature book. They were asked to write their reactions to the audiotapes in a journal. Their parents were asked to share stories of their lives with their children and to initial the pages of the children's journals after reading them. The students' families were visited by two community aides, who encouraged the parents to read Spanish literature books once a night to their children. Parents were also encouraged to listen to the audiotapes from the backpack materials. The aides also verified the parents' participation by making sure they were sharing stories and initialing their children's journals. Academic achievement (using the Spanish Assessment of Basic Education (SABE)) and self-esteem (using the Behavioral Academic Self-Esteem Test (BASE)) were measured before and after 5 months of participation in the project. Treatment students made larger gains on all measures than did control students, but the differences were not statistically significant.

47269780,Butler (1991) PE,1991,"An innovative integrated remedial reading program has been developed based on recent research findings. My longitudinal studies have revealed that poor reading compounds itself over the years. The majority of children with reading disabilities currently remain in regular classrooms with varying techniques being used depending upon individual school directives and current educational theory. Despite current remedial techniques, the poorer reader tends to remain so throughout the school years. Innovative techniques must be developed in the hope of altering this pattern. This paper presents one alternative strategy which can be used to upgrade reading skills and break the cycle of reading failure. The Reading Assistance Tutorial Pack (R.A.T. Pack) is a carefully sequenced series of activities that enables the learner to experience the motivating and reinforcing properties of success through all stages of phonetic and reading skills development. It is a systematic, multidisciplinary remedial reading program based on sound behavior, psycholinguistic and cognitive theories of learning—incorporating listening, speaking, seeing, writing, thinking, and comprehension skills. The R.A.T. Pack demands a high percentage of on-task behavior and trains phonological processing strategies. Functional language use is promoted through enjoyable activities involving sentence construction, cloze passages, puzzles, games, and other creative manipulations of the surface features of languages.

It was hypothesized that children who played learning games with their parents would achieve significantly greater scores in reading and I.Q. than children denied such gaming experience. Thirty second grade children from the Seattle Central Area served as subjects. There were three hypotheses relating the effects of three treatments to four variables  vocabulary, comprehension, composite reading and I.Q. The research design had three major components  1) tests for differences between treatment groups, 2) tests for correlation of certain of the dependent measures, and 3) tests for interaction of I.Q. (high and low) and treatment upon dependent variables. Methods of analyses involved Analysis of Covariance as well as Correlational techniques. Results indicated that 1) the Experimental Treatment resulted in significant differences in vocabulary, composite reading and I.Q. but not for comprehension  2) that certain variables correlated highly with I.Q.  3) that the treatment effects were significant when groups were divided by I.Q.  and 4) that no interaction existed between treatment and I.Q. The researcher concluded that learning games used by economically disadvantaged parents increased the reading achievement and I.Q. scores of their children.

Benjamin Bloom and Ravindrakumar Dave identified six environmental variables  achievement press, language models, academic guidance, activeness of the family, intellectuality in the home, and work habits in the family. These home environmental characteristics were the theme for the parent education program which was the independent variable in this experiment. The treatment consisted of parent meetings, school newsletters, and home news notes during an academic year. Forty-six nine-year-old children entering the fourth grade in a midwestern elementary school were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Effect size was used to determine the treatment effect on the following dependent variables  mathematics and reading achievement scores from the California Achievement Test, mathematics attitude score from the Attitude Toward Mathematics Scale, reading attitude score from a variation of The Attitude Toward Mathematics Scale, and homework completion rate. A t test was computed on attendance. Significance was determined at the.05 level. The findings of this study indicated that the students in the experimental group performed at a higher achievement level than did the students in the control group in both reading and mathematics, but students of the control group showed a greater interest in reading and mathematics.

This training took place over a day and was provided by a consultant. The second component focused on parental engagement and offered families the opportunity to participate in a series of facilitated workshops where children and parents work together to create an animated film. Sessions were coordinated by a practitioner who helped participants to think about how they are learning, create learning goals and reflect on their progress  to be metacognitive about the learning process they were engaged in together. The families were offered 2 hours of workshops per week for 5 weeks (10 hours in total). The project targeted schools in four areas of England  Birmingham, Devon, London and Manchester. It was delivered by the Campaign for Learning, with assessments carried out by Durham University. Delivery started in September 2012 and finished in October 2013. The project was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial, which compared the interventions to a ‘business-as-usual’ control group.

42025140,Glass (1978),1978,"Purpose  One of the major problems in inner-city schools is negative parental attitudes and lack of parental involvement. According to the literature search, schools can help alleviate negative feelings if parents are encouraged to take a more active role in the education of their children  if experiences are provided that will help develop positive attitudes within parents  and if efforts are made to create a more desirable relationship between parents and the school staff. Parental involvement in the school program is extremely important to the effectiveness of the educational program in meeting the needs of children. Therefore, fostering positive parental attitudes and increasing parental involvement in schools have recently become very important goals for educators and administrators alike at all levels of the educational hierarchy. The purpose of this study was to obtain descriptive information pertinent to the effects of a parental involvement program on the attitudes of parents, self-concept, achievement, and attendance of students in an inner-city elementary school. Methods and Procedures  Parents in the study were categorized according to their level involvement in the program of the school. Experimental and control classes were set up in kindergarten, primary, intermediate, and upper levels. Parents were assigned to work in the experimental classes for a designated number of hours per week. Children of parents who were participants in the program were classified according to the level of participation of their parents and whether or not they were recipients of volunteer services in their classrooms. Attitudes of parents, selfconcept, achievement, and attendance of pupils were examined and analyzed.

Parents attended a training session where they received instruction in new English Language Arts Standards, the stages of the writing process, strategies for developing writing as a recursive process, and in the criteria of a scoring rubric used to evaluate their child's writing. The study consisted of three phases. In Phase 3, parents scored their child's writing sample and discussed areas of improvement with their children based on the information shared in the training session and using a writing rubric. Students in the experimental groups represented three socioeconomic classes. Results indicated that when students had an understanding of the criteria for evaluation, their writing scores improved. Moreover, when their parents became knowledgeable of the writing process and the criteria for evaluation, they were better able to interact with their children to discuss areas in need of improvement.

A study was carried out of a reading at home parental involvement project in a primary school serving a working‐class area. The project was satisfactorily implemented and 76 children completed three years in it. Their reading test scores were compared to those of similar children who had passed through the school before the project. No significant improvement was found in test performance. The findings are discussed in relation to those of the Haringey Project (Tizard et al. , 1982). It is hypothesised that the effects of this form of parental involvement may depend on the nature of home visiting which supports it, on the previous extent of parental involvement, or on whether the families concerned are from ethnic minorities.

Also assessed was the effect of the interventions on parent participation and parent impressions of home-school connectedness. Eighty-four students in fourth- and fifth-grade evidencing poor performance in mathematics were selected. Students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions  RPT plus Parent Involvement (PI), RPT Only, and Control. Prior to the interventions, students completed both curriculum-based and standardized computation measures. Measures of school adjustment were completed by the students and their teachers. Additionally, parents completed a measure assessing their level of participation in their children's learning experiences. Following the intervention, all measures were re-administered and student, parent, and teacher satisfaction were assessed. Analyses of covariance indicated that students who received the RPT intervention in combination with a parent Reproduced with involvement intervention displayed the highest levels of accurate computations. Repeated measures ANCOVAs of school adjustment measures showed that RPT plus PI students received higher teacher ratings of positive academic and social behaviors than did Controls. Students involved in both RPT conditions perceived themselves as more socially confident with peers than did Controls. The measure assessing parent participation was found to be unreliable and was not used to assess pretest-posttest differences between groups. Students, parents, and teachers were highly satisfied with both RPT interventions. These results replicate previous findings in which participation in the RPT intervention yielded significantly higher academic gains in mathematics than nonparticipation. Findings extend previous research by indicating the greater effectiveness of RPT when combined with active parent involvement. The need for a reliable, valid measure to assess parent participation in children's learning was addressed.

The intervention, Early Access to Success in Education (Project EASE), was designed to increase the frequency and quality of language interactions through book-centered activities and to give parents information about and opportunities for engagement in their children's developing literacy abilities. Parents received information about ways to strengthen vocabulary, extend narrative understanding, develop letter recognition and sound awareness, produce narrative retellings, and understand exposition. Measures of home literacy support were collected from parents and a battery of language and literacy tests were adminis- tered to intervention and comparison children prior to the intervention and at its conclusion. Children whose families engaged in the at- school and at-home activities made significantly greater gains in language scores as measured on subtests of vocabulary, story comprehension, and sequencing in story-telling than comparison children. The greatest gains were found in those low-achieving students who started out with low language skills at pretest and strong home literacy support. Parents in general showed high levels of par- ticipation in the prescribed activities, and they reported high levels of satisfaction.

42025439,Kiesner (1997),1997,"The social interactional model of antisocial behavior (Patterson, Reid, & Dishion, 1992) suggests that academic failure is both an outcome of disrupted parenting and a potential risk factor in the escalation of problem behavior. Therefore, improving academic success may serve as a protective factor against the escalation of antisocial behavior. Some research suggests that academic interventions are able to improve the academic performance of antisocial children. However, most of these studies have been conducted in restrictive settings such as special classes or juvenile detention centers. One potential method for improving a student''s academic success in a less restrictive setting is to increase the student''s engagement in school activities such as homework completion. This study investigated a model that suggested that an intervention aimed at increasing parental supervision of a routine study-time would improve the students'' level of school engagement, as measured by attendance, homework completion, and homework accuracy, and that school engagement would account for a significant amount of variance in antisocial behavior, math performance, and social interactions. Subjects were 29 middle school iv students at risk for antisocial behavior because of low academic performance and teacher reports. Students and their parents were assigned randomly to an intervention group or a control group. The intervention consisted of four main components, a video-based instructional program establishing a routine study-time, parental monitoring of the child''s routine study time, a home-school communication process using the teachers'' voice mail and the students'' school calendar, and ongoing support and consultation via weekly telephone calls to the parents. Results provided only partial support for the model. The treatment package had no significant effects on School Engagement. However, School Engagement accounted for a significant amount of variance in student math grades and teacher-reported antisocial behavior.

Six of the\ncategories represent positive and negative interactions initiated by the target student and\ndirected to: the teacher, a peer, or an unspecified recipient (talking with no clear target\npresent). The other four categories represented positive and negative interactions initiated\nby the teacher or peer, and directed towards the target student. Therefore, each interaction\ncould have been coded with regards to the valence of interaction (positive or negative) and\nto the initiator of the interaction (target student, peer, teacher). For the data analysis of\nthe social interactions, two scores were computed: (a) total positive interactions, and (b)\ntotal negative interactions. Initially, the teacher-initiated interactions were going to be\nincluded in these scores. However, in examining the data, it was observed that\nteacher-initiated positive interactions accounted for 61% of the total positive interactions\nand that these teacher-initiated positive interactions were primarily made up of teaching\nbehaviors and not necessarily directed at the target student. Therefore, the[¬e]""', 'Page 62:\n[¬s]""teacher-initiated positive interactions were not included in the total positive score.\nObservation intervals were 10 seconds long with a 5-second period for data\nrecording.

Initial calculations indicated that all observations tested for inter-observer\nagreement met the 75% agreement criterion (M = 8 8\n%, range = 78% -100%). However,\nonce the teacher-initiated positive interactions were excluded, the mean level of agreement\nfell just below the 75% agreement criterion (M = 74.6%, range = 42% -100%).

These data indicate that conclusions drawn from the negative interactions should be\nconsidered with caution. The low estimate of reliability for negative interactions may be\nthe result of using an interval time-sampling type of recording system for a low baserate\nbehavior.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Parent Readiness Education Project (PREP) on readiness skills and subsequent performance of preschool children.  Procedures. This was an ex-post-facto study using summative evaluative procedures. Seven hundred and thirty-six students from the Ballard, Eastside, Ellis, Howard, and Oak Manor elementary schools in the Niles Community School District, Niles, Michigan, were used in this evaluation. All the subjects had participated in the Title III federally funded PREP screening program which selected those students with anticipated learning problems for PREP training. Two hundred and fifty-nine children received PREP training.  One-way analysis of variance and one-way analysis of covariance were used to analyze the results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, Caldwell Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills subtests. Simple t-test for independent means and correlated means were used to analyze the pretest and posttest scores of the Caldwell Preschool Inventory.  Results. With the exception of the first annual group, the PREP students made significant gains in readiness skill areas in comparison to the Non-PREP and Non-Accepting PREP students. Follow-up studies at the end of kindergarten right through fourth grades continued to show significance in favor of the PREP group. In almost every case the PREP students had at least caught up with the Non-PREP students, and scored significantly higher than the Non-Accepting PREP group. However, for the first annual group the PREP students failed to close the gap between them and the Non-PREP in nine cases on the CTBS Subtests. Furthermore, they did not surpass the Non-Accepting PREP group in four subtests.  Conclusion.

Groups of parents and their children (usually around 5–8 families in each group) attend eight weekly 2.5-hour group sessions after school, delivered by trained local partners. Families then continue to meet on a more informal basis for up to 22 months, a period known as FASTworks. Sessions are designed to encourage good home routines around mealtimes, bedtimes and homework with the intention that this will improve the behaviour of the attending pupils, freeing up the teacher to focus on learning to the benefit of the whole class.

Analyses of the reading knowledge of the first year students indicated reliable and longlasting effects of the treatment. The treatment affected not only story reading but also word reading and spelling. Year 2 students showed a smaller instructional effect when compared with control students.

Participants included 52 fourth and fifth grade students. Students were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group. Parent perceptions of homework problems were assessed using the Homework Problem Checklist. Achievement was assessed via teacher assigned mathematics grades and curriculum based mathematics probes. Outcome measures were collected at three intervals  pretest, posttest, follow-up over an 18 week period. Data analysis revealed that all subjects showed significant improvement on the percentage of homework turned in, on teacher assigned grades, and on curriculum based mathematics probes over the three time periods of the study.

PR consists of two phases  simultaneous and independent reading. The PR method focuses on parent modeling, practice, praise and a positive atmosphere. Fifty-two parents of second and third graders receiving Chapter 1 services and fourth graders who received Chapter 1 services in the year prior were recruited for this study. Participants were assigned to either the experimental (PR) condition where they were trained to use the PR Program through a competency-based training format or to a wait-list control condition. Twenty-four of the 26 parents in the PR condition participated in the training. Parents were asked to read with their child using the PR method five times a week, for 10 to 15 minutes, across eight weeks and to tape record their reading sessions. Seven of those 24 parents returned all eight audio recordings of the reading sessions. Eight participants returned no tapes and 9 subjects returned between one and seven tapes. Overall reading improvement based on reading accuracy, rate and comprehension was assessed in the children, using difference scores obtained on the Paragraph Reading subtest of the Gray Oral Reading Test-Diagnostic. Child and parent perceptions of the child's reading skills and reading habits were also assessed. Comparisons were made between participants in the trained PR and untrained control conditions. Significant attrition effected the analysis of the data and an intent-to-treat-analysis was conducted. Children in the PR condition did not improve more than children in the control condition on overall reading scores. The small subset of children who completed the program did, however, improve more in their overall reading scores than their matched controls. A post-hoc analysis indicated that second and third graders who were receiving Chapter 1 services in school improved significantly in their overall reading scores and that the fourth graders, who no longer were eligible for Chapter 1 services in their school, did not show improvement over the course of this study.

The method. The subjects (N = 136) scored at or below the fiftieth percentile in reading and mathematics on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and were served in a Chapter I replacement model for reading and mathematics. The study site was Blackshear Trail School, Crisp County, Georgia, a second and third grade elementary school. Scores, ranked from highest to lowest by grade, were grouped to assure equal groups. Group A parents received monthly communication by letter. Group B parents received monthly communication by letter with an invitation from the school to visit their child's classroom and have lunch with their child. Transportation and the cost of lunch were provided by the school. Group C parents received monthly communication through home visits. Group D was the control group and received standard school communication. Parent and teacher questionnaires were completed. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine group differences. Results. Group differences attributable to the type of parent involvement communication implemented were not found. There were no significant differences among groups in terms of student reading achievement, conduct, attendance, homework habits, and parent-student-school interaction. The data from this study supported the decision to fail to reject the null hypotheses. Conclusions. This study indicated there may not be one specific communication type which is most advantageous for promoting parent involvement but that a variety of types may be best. Parent and teacher questionnaires revealed relevant information regarding different perspectives and opinions of parent involvement in terms of its effect on school and children. Parents were generally pleased with the school and expressed positive feelings regarding the school's parent involvement program. Parents' attitudes toward school, considered to be important to their child's success, may produce long range benefits to the student which were not measured by this study.

The study was conducted in an educationally disadvantaged South African community where the effectiveness of a paired reading parent involvement programme, which stressed interaction around reading as a means of mediating meaning, was evaluated. Aims. The research aimed to evaluate whether reading accuracy, comprehension and attitude were promoted through involving parents and other family members as mediators in a process of paired reading. Further, it aimed to elucidate interactive ecosystemic effects across family, school and community levels. Samples. Two complete grade four classes (29 and 32 children respectively) served as comparison groups (average age  9 years 7 months). Methods. To test the significance of the improvement in reading accuracy and comprehension (Neale Analysis of Reading Ability  Neale, 1966) and attitude (Elementary Reading Attitude Survey  McKenna & Kear, 1990) for the experimental group relative to the control, one-tailed t-tests for independent samples on the respective pre-test/post-test difference scores were applied. Results. Statistically significant improvements in reading accuracy and comprehension, as well as reading attitude and involvement, were demonstrated. A broad ecosystemic analysis suggested that positive relationships between children and significant others in the family were nurtured and other children in the family were benefiting. Interactions between family and school, and school and the local community library, were also enhanced. Conclusions. The study emphasises the importance of developing mediation insights and skills in parent involvement programmes, and the place of ecosystemic analysis in understanding the social dynamics involved in such programmes.

This relation is consistent and robust, but fails to consider additional factors that may be influential in predicting children's literacy performance. Moreover, this relation speaks to the use of reading programs to improve children's achievement by increasing reading frequency. Two studies were conducted to examine these issues. Study 1 proposed and tested a comprehensive model of children's literacy performance where the association between children's home literacy environment, reading motivation, and achievement was mediated by children's reading exposure. A sample ( N = 116) of grade 3 and 5 children and their parents participated. Findings were in accord with the model  however, children's reading motivation was a significant and unique predictor of children's reading and spelling ability. Overall, the findings of Study 1 suggested that incorporating additional explanatory factors is necessary to children's literacy performance. Study 2 tested whether a summer reading program would improve achievement measures in a targeted sample (N = 57) of poor achievers from Study 1. Children were randomly assigned to a Book Reading Group or Control Group. Over 8-weeks children in the Book Reading Group were sent one book per week that was matched to their interest and reading level. In addition, parents acted as reading models and were trained to use skill-building strategies. As predicted, children in the Book Reading Group showed significant gains in reading compared to children in the Control Group. No group differences were found for oral language skills or reading motivation. Study 2 revealed that providing access to books and maximizing the role of parents was an effective method for improving poor achiever's literacy skills over the summer.

Specifically, this study identified beginning mathematics achievement levels of first-grade pupils from two elementary schools at the pre-kindergarten level, kindergarten level and on-grade-level. Beginning mathematics achievement levels were determined by a pretest using the mathematics curriculum used in Richland School District One called Progress and Review in Mathematics Education (PRIME).

42025497,Sylva (2008),2008,"Background. Low levels of literacy and high levels of behaviour problems in middle childhood often co‐occur. These persistent difficulties pose a risk to academic and social development, leading to social exclusion in adulthood. Although parent‐training programmes have been shown to be effective in enabling parents to support their children's development, very few parent interventions offer a combination of behavioural and literacy training. Aims. This paper (1) reports on a prevention programme which aimed to tackle behaviour and literacy problems in children at the beginning of school, and (2) presents the effects of the intervention on children's literacy. Sample. One hundred and four 5‐ and 6‐year‐old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods. This is a randomized control trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. The behavioural intervention consisted of the ‘Incredible Years’ group parenting programme combined with a new programme designed to train parents to support their children's reading at home. Results. Analyses demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on children's word reading and writing skills, as well as parents' use of reading strategies with their children. Conclusion. A structured multicomponent preventive package delivered with attention to fidelity can enable parents to support their children's reading at home and increase their literacy skills.

A total of 28 families/31 students participated in the study. A pretest-posttest control group design was used. The experimental group subjects' parents received training in homework monitoring. The Computation section, Level 2 of the Mathematics subtest of the Stanford Achievement Test, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventories and, a ""Student Mathematics Homework Perception Scale"" constructed by the researcher were used for pre and posttest measures of achievement, self-esteem and students' perceptions. The students' grades and the percentage of homework they completed and returned for the first three quarters were obtained from their mathematics teachers. Ten of the experimental group subjects' families were interviewed at the end of the study. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between either the computation or the self-esteem posttest scores of the two groups. No significant differences were obtained for teachers' grades and the percentage of homework completed and returned. However, the grades and percentage of homework completed and returned by the experimental group showed a trend in the expected direction. A significant difference was found (p $<$.05) in the perception posttest scores of teacher involvement in mathematics homework. Significant negative correlations were found between parent level of education (p $<$.05) and self-esteem measures and between teachers' grades and self-esteem measures (p $<$.05) for the experimental group.

Academic performance was measured by the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) mathematics battery. The researcher developed an intervention program to provide parents training on how to assist their children with mathematics homework. Parents received an overview of the skills needed to understand mathematics concepts taught to fifth grade students. In addition, teaching techniques used by the classroom teachers were discussed, the ITBS assessment was explained, and feedback was given on their child''s scores. In support of this training program, the researcher published a weekly newsletter that discussed the current training session and the children''s classroom requirements for the week. This quasi-experimental study consisted of the children of 30 parents who volunteered to come to the training sessions and a control group of 35 students whose parents did not come to training, but allowed their children to participate in the study by taking the pretest and posttest of the ITBS mathematics battery. The experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group in all sections of the ITBS and in the total battery score as well. Further examination of the means displayed a higher increase for the experimental group in all areas of the test with the exception of the concept and estimation sections. In addition, the experimental group completed and turned in significantly more homework than did the control group.

Working within a community-based child health care agency in Washington, D.C., the Parent Participation Reading Clinic offered an innovative model for providing remedial educational assistance to low-income educationally handicapped children through involvement of the child's parents or older sibling as a ""home-instructor"" in the teaching process. Thirty-eight elementary school children (19 experimental and 19 match control) participated in the study over an eight month period. As a group, the experimental children who participated in the program showed significant gains over the matched control group on eight month re-evaluation on the California Test of Basic Skills, vocabulary and comprehension reading sub-tests. The results indicated no significant positive effects among experimental subjects for increasing IQ scores as measured on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test.
