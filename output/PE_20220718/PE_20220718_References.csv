42025124,['Parental engagement'],Arnold (1996),Arnold Joy   J E   ,1996,A study to determine the effects of direct parental involvement on student mathematical achievement in grades three through five.,NA,NA,Dissertation,"The purpose of the study was to determine if direct parental training would effect third, fourth, and fifth grade students' academic performance in the area of mathematics. Mathematics is an important subject in elementary education. The major emphasis of the activities involved was on reinforcing computational skills. Those interested in the formal education of students, both in the K-12 arena and also teacher education programs at universities should find the analysis of the effects of parent-school involvement an important area of study. Parents who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to one of three study groups. Treatment Group A consisted of direct parental training in the area of mathematical activities concentrating on computational skills which were played at home with their children. Treatment Group B only received the mathematical activities which were played at home with their children. Group C was the Control Group. Based upon this research, parental involvement does not make a difference with third and fifth grade students' mathematical achievement test scores. There was however, significance with the fourth grade students' mathematical achievement test scores. Further analysis revealed that at the third grade, those students who returned log books scored significantly higher on the mathematic achievement test scores than those students who did not return the log books. There was no significance found for the fourth and fifth grades with respect to the log books. Additionally, at the third grade, females played more of the mathematical activities than did the males. At the fourth grade, the males played more of the mathematical activities than the females, at the fifth grade, the males played approximately twice as many mathematical activities as the females. There was no significance found at the third and fourth grades with respect to gender, however, significance was found at the fifth grade.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //search.proquest.com/docview/304274987,NA,NA,Wayne State University

The subjects were 77 first grade children enrolled in an urban elementary school in the South and their parents. The school system placed children in one of four first grade classrooms in the fall, 1987, based on their achievement scores in reading and math. Mean class achievement scores and teacher experiences were used to designate two classes as experimental and two as comparison. Parents of children in the experimental classes received a group meeting at the beginning of the year, another meeting in the middle of the year, and daily parent-aided homework assignments listing the objective and learning activity from October, 1987 to April, 1988. The comparison parents received two group meetings, with different content, and no systematic parent-aided homework. Analysis of Covariance and Sheffe's procedure failed to reject null hypotheses 1 and 2 indicating that no significant differences existed in achievement scores received in reading and math on the GCRT between students who had received the parent/homework intervention program and those who had not. Computation of Pearson's r yielded moderate positive correlations allowing the rejection of null hypotheses 3 and 4, thus, revealing a positive correlation did exist between the number of reading and math parent/homework intervention assignments completed and GCRT reading and math achievement scores. The moderate positive correlations found between achievement scores and amount of homework completed along with the positive responses from parents and students indicated that homework can be effectively used with primary age children when parent participation is included in the homework process. The study demonstrated that (1) homework will be completed by primary age students if it is well-organized and easy to locate  (2) completion of parent-aided homework is moderately related to academic achievement  and (3) the parent/homework intervention program improved parent's understanding of their child's educational strengths and weaknesses, relations with the school, and the overall climate of parent-teacher relations.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //search.proquest.com/docview/303717870,NA,NA,Memphis State University

These 'disruptive' children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year  no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains  parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother-child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children. Even so, most treatment effects were specific to the school environment and did not affect achievement skills. These findings must be viewed as tentative until follow-up evaluations can be done to determine the long-term outcomes of these interventions.",41,3,319-332, https //doi.org/10.1111/1469-7610.00616,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //search.proquest.com/docview/85629540,NA,"Logan, UT",Utah State University

Thirty-four children and their mothers participated. Mothers in the treatment group were taught to use the strategy to engage their children in conversation while reading storybooks. Data gathered from the children at pretest and posttest were measures of receptive vocabulary (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised), expressive vocabulary by calculating mean length of utterance and concepts about print using a checklist. Use of the Adult/Child Interactive Reading Inventory (ACIRI) provided data about mother and child behaviors at pretest and posttest. An attitudinal measure assessed the trained mothers' self-efficacy as a literacy coach. Findings include direct effects on the mothers' ability to use the strategy as well as indirect effects on the children's emergent literacy behaviors. Statistically significant effects were found for concepts about print (p < .05) using an ANOVA. A strong positive correlation (r(12) = .85, p < .001) between the treatment group mother's and child's ACIRI score was found. Time spent in Even Start (p < .02) and the mother's ACIRI score (p < .01) were positively related to the child's mean length of utterance in a multiple linear regression analysis. A moderate positive correlation was found (r(12) = .54, p < .05) for the relation between the mother's ACIRI score and the self-efficacy measure at posttest.

The project was also intended to provide indirect instruction to these students' parents and other family members who could facilitate their educational achievement. Participants were 124 students and their parents from a small California school district with a population that is primarily Spanish speaking. The students were in eight bilingual classes in grades 1 through 3. Only 61 families were actually involved in project activities  the remaining families served as a control group. Teachers encouraged the students to take home literature backpacks, each containing a cassette player, audiotape, and Spanish literature book. They were asked to write their reactions to the audiotapes in a journal. Their parents were asked to share stories of their lives with their children and to initial the pages of the children's journals after reading them. The students' families were visited by two community aides, who encouraged the parents to read Spanish literature books once a night to their children. Parents were also encouraged to listen to the audiotapes from the backpack materials. The aides also verified the parents' participation by making sure they were sharing stories and initialing their children's journals. Academic achievement (using the Spanish Assessment of Basic Education (SABE)) and self-esteem (using the Behavioral Academic Self-Esteem Test (BASE)) were measured before and after 5 months of participation in the project. Treatment students made larger gains on all measures than did control students, but the differences were not statistically significant. Third graders scored significantly higher on the SABE in academic gains than did students in other grade levels. Female students scored significantly higher on the BASE than did males. Although no statistical support was shown for the program as indicated by statistical tests, the study did demonstrate that a parent literacy program can bond parents and children through a literacy environment.

My longitudinal studies have revealed that poor reading compounds itself over the years. The majority of children with reading disabilities currently remain in regular classrooms with varying techniques being used depending upon individual school directives and current educational theory. Despite current remedial techniques, the poorer reader tends to remain so throughout the school years. Innovative techniques must be developed in the hope of altering this pattern. This paper presents one alternative strategy which can be used to upgrade reading skills and break the cycle of reading failure. The Reading Assistance Tutorial Pack (R.A.T. Pack) is a carefully sequenced series of activities that enables the learner to experience the motivating and reinforcing properties of success through all stages of phonetic and reading skills development. It is a systematic, multidisciplinary remedial reading program based on sound behavior, psycholinguistic and cognitive theories of learning—incorporating listening, speaking, seeing, writing, thinking, and comprehension skills. The R.A.T. Pack demands a high percentage of on-task behavior and trains phonological processing strategies. Functional language use is promoted through enjoyable activities involving sentence construction, cloze passages, puzzles, games, and other creative manipulations of the surface features of languages.

It was hypothesized that children who played learning games with their parents would achieve significantly greater scores in reading and I.Q. than children denied such gaming experience. Thirty second grade children from the Seattle Central Area served as subjects. There were three hypotheses relating the effects of three treatments to four variables  vocabulary, comprehension, composite reading and I.Q. The research design had three major components  1) tests for differences between treatment groups, 2) tests for correlation of certain of the dependent measures, and 3) tests for interaction of I.Q. (high and low) and treatment upon dependent variables. Methods of analyses involved Analysis of Covariance as well as Correlational techniques. Results indicated that 1) the Experimental Treatment resulted in significant differences in vocabulary, composite reading and I.Q. but not for comprehension  2) that certain variables correlated highly with I.Q.  3) that the treatment effects were significant when groups were divided by I.Q.  and 4) that no interaction existed between treatment and I.Q. The researcher concluded that learning games used by economically disadvantaged parents increased the reading achievement and I.Q. scores of their children.

According to the literature search, schools can help alleviate negative feelings if parents are encouraged to take a more active role in the education of their children  if experiences are provided that will help develop positive attitudes within parents  and if efforts are made to create a more desirable relationship between parents and the school staff. Parental involvement in the school program is extremely important to the effectiveness of the educational program in meeting the needs of children. Therefore, fostering positive parental attitudes and increasing parental involvement in schools have recently become very important goals for educators and administrators alike at all levels of the educational hierarchy. The purpose of this study was to obtain descriptive information pertinent to the effects of a parental involvement program on the attitudes of parents, self-concept, achievement, and attendance of students in an inner-city elementary school. Methods and Procedures  Parents in the study were categorized according to their level involvement in the program of the school. Experimental and control classes were set up in kindergarten, primary, intermediate, and upper levels. Parents were assigned to work in the experimental classes for a designated number of hours per week. Children of parents who were participants in the program were classified according to the level of participation of their parents and whether or not they were recipients of volunteer services in their classrooms. Attitudes of parents, selfconcept, achievement, and attendance of pupils were examined and analyzed. Interviews were conducted with pupils, parents, and teachers in order to investigate their reactions to the program.

Also assessed was the effect of the interventions on parent participation and parent impressions of home-school connectedness. Eighty-four students in fourth- and fifth-grade evidencing poor performance in mathematics were selected. Students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions  RPT plus Parent Involvement (PI), RPT Only, and Control. Prior to the interventions, students completed both curriculum-based and standardized computation measures. Measures of school adjustment were completed by the students and their teachers. Additionally, parents completed a measure assessing their level of participation in their children's learning experiences. Following the intervention, all measures were re-administered and student, parent, and teacher satisfaction were assessed. Analyses of covariance indicated that students who received the RPT intervention in combination with a parent Reproduced with involvement intervention displayed the highest levels of accurate computations. Repeated measures ANCOVAs of school adjustment measures showed that RPT plus PI students received higher teacher ratings of positive academic and social behaviors than did Controls. Students involved in both RPT conditions perceived themselves as more socially confident with peers than did Controls. The measure assessing parent participation was found to be unreliable and was not used to assess pretest-posttest differences between groups. Students, parents, and teachers were highly satisfied with both RPT interventions. These results replicate previous findings in which participation in the RPT intervention yielded significantly higher academic gains in mathematics than nonparticipation.

Therefore, improving academic success may serve as a protective factor against the escalation of antisocial behavior. Some research suggests that academic interventions are able to improve the academic performance of antisocial children. However, most of these studies have been conducted in restrictive settings such as special classes or juvenile detention centers. One potential method for improving a student''s academic success in a less restrictive setting is to increase the student''s engagement in school activities such as homework completion. This study investigated a model that suggested that an intervention aimed at increasing parental supervision of a routine study-time would improve the students'' level of school engagement, as measured by attendance, homework completion, and homework accuracy, and that school engagement would account for a significant amount of variance in antisocial behavior, math performance, and social interactions. Subjects were 29 middle school iv students at risk for antisocial behavior because of low academic performance and teacher reports. Students and their parents were assigned randomly to an intervention group or a control group. The intervention consisted of four main components, a video-based instructional program establishing a routine study-time, parental monitoring of the child''s routine study time, a home-school communication process using the teachers'' voice mail and the students'' school calendar, and ongoing support and consultation via weekly telephone calls to the parents. Results provided only partial support for the model. The treatment package had no significant effects on School Engagement. However, School Engagement accounted for a significant amount of variance in student math grades and teacher-reported antisocial behavior.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Parent Readiness Education Project (PREP) on readiness skills and subsequent performance of preschool children.  Procedures. This was an ex-post-facto study using summative evaluative procedures. Seven hundred and thirty-six students from the Ballard, Eastside, Ellis, Howard, and Oak Manor elementary schools in the Niles Community School District, Niles, Michigan, were used in this evaluation. All the subjects had participated in the Title III federally funded PREP screening program which selected those students with anticipated learning problems for PREP training. Two hundred and fifty-nine children received PREP training.  One-way analysis of variance and one-way analysis of covariance were used to analyze the results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, Caldwell Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills subtests. Simple t-test for independent means and correlated means were used to analyze the pretest and posttest scores of the Caldwell Preschool Inventory.  Results. With the exception of the first annual group, the PREP students made significant gains in readiness skill areas in comparison to the Non-PREP and Non-Accepting PREP students. Follow-up studies at the end of kindergarten right through fourth grades continued to show significance in favor of the PREP group. In almost every case the PREP students had at least caught up with the Non-PREP students, and scored significantly higher than the Non-Accepting PREP group. However, for the first annual group the PREP students failed to close the gap between them and the Non-PREP in nine cases on the CTBS Subtests. Furthermore, they did not surpass the Non-Accepting PREP group in four subtests.  Conclusion.

Forty-five children and their parents enrolled in a kindergarten in a university-sponsored primary school participated in the research. Approximately twice as many children who participated in the home reading program scored in the top quartile of the Woodcock Reading Mastery (WRMT-R) word identification and word attack subtests as might be expected based on the test norms, while the children in the control group approximated the expected norms. On curriculum-based measures, the average score of children in the home reading group was higher than 87% of the children in the control group. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that a significant proportion of the variance in children’s posttest performance was associated with their pretest scores on the WRMT-R letter identification subtest scores, their knowledge of the phonemes introduced in the curriculum and the consistency with which their parents implemented the home reading program.

PR consists of two phases  simultaneous and independent reading. The PR method focuses on parent modeling, practice, praise and a positive atmosphere. Fifty-two parents of second and third graders receiving Chapter 1 services and fourth graders who received Chapter 1 services in the year prior were recruited for this study. Participants were assigned to either the experimental (PR) condition where they were trained to use the PR Program through a competency-based training format or to a wait-list control condition. Twenty-four of the 26 parents in the PR condition participated in the training. Parents were asked to read with their child using the PR method five times a week, for 10 to 15 minutes, across eight weeks and to tape record their reading sessions. Seven of those 24 parents returned all eight audio recordings of the reading sessions. Eight participants returned no tapes and 9 subjects returned between one and seven tapes. Overall reading improvement based on reading accuracy, rate and comprehension was assessed in the children, using difference scores obtained on the Paragraph Reading subtest of the Gray Oral Reading Test-Diagnostic. Child and parent perceptions of the child's reading skills and reading habits were also assessed. Comparisons were made between participants in the trained PR and untrained control conditions.

The study was conducted in an educationally disadvantaged South African community where the effectiveness of a paired reading parent involvement programme, which stressed interaction around reading as a means of mediating meaning, was evaluated. Aims. The research aimed to evaluate whether reading accuracy, comprehension and attitude were promoted through involving parents and other family members as mediators in a process of paired reading. Further, it aimed to elucidate interactive ecosystemic effects across family, school and community levels. Samples. Two complete grade four classes (29 and 32 children respectively) served as comparison groups (average age  9 years 7 months). Methods. To test the significance of the improvement in reading accuracy and comprehension (Neale Analysis of Reading Ability  Neale, 1966) and attitude (Elementary Reading Attitude Survey  McKenna & Kear, 1990) for the experimental group relative to the control, one-tailed t-tests for independent samples on the respective pre-test/post-test difference scores were applied. Results. Statistically significant improvements in reading accuracy and comprehension, as well as reading attitude and involvement, were demonstrated. A broad ecosystemic analysis suggested that positive relationships between children and significant others in the family were nurtured and other children in the family were benefiting. Interactions between family and school, and school and the local community library, were also enhanced. Conclusions. The study emphasises the importance of developing mediation insights and skills in parent involvement programmes, and the place of ecosystemic analysis in understanding the social dynamics involved in such programmes.

This relation is consistent and robust, but fails to consider additional factors that may be influential in predicting children's literacy performance. Moreover, this relation speaks to the use of reading programs to improve children's achievement by increasing reading frequency. Two studies were conducted to examine these issues. Study 1 proposed and tested a comprehensive model of children's literacy performance where the association between children's home literacy environment, reading motivation, and achievement was mediated by children's reading exposure. A sample ( N = 116) of grade 3 and 5 children and their parents participated. Findings were in accord with the model  however, children's reading motivation was a significant and unique predictor of children's reading and spelling ability. Overall, the findings of Study 1 suggested that incorporating additional explanatory factors is necessary to children's literacy performance. Study 2 tested whether a summer reading program would improve achievement measures in a targeted sample (N = 57) of poor achievers from Study 1. Children were randomly assigned to a Book Reading Group or Control Group. Over 8-weeks children in the Book Reading Group were sent one book per week that was matched to their interest and reading level. In addition, parents acted as reading models and were trained to use skill-building strategies. As predicted, children in the Book Reading Group showed significant gains in reading compared to children in the Control Group. No group differences were found for oral language skills or reading motivation.

Subjects were 50 first-grade students in the Madison County, Mississippi public school system who were randomly selected and assigned to either a control or experimental group. Parents of students assigned to the experimental group received the parental training component, HELP (Home Enrichment Learning Program), while parents of students assigned to the control group received no training. After a period of approximately 15 weeks, the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests and the Elementary Reading Attitude Survey were administered to each student in the control and treatment groups. Six null hypotheses were proposed and tested. The reading achievement data were analyzed using an independent samples t-test with alpha preset at.05, power at.80, and medium effect size. Alternative hypotheses were nondirectional. Reading attitude data were analyzed with an independent samples Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with alpha preset at.05. Alternative hypotheses were nondirectional. Three null hypotheses (relating to reading achievement data) were rejected, and three null hypotheses (relating to reading attitude data) were not rejected in the study. The following conclusions were reached  (1) Parental participation in a training program designed to train parents in methods to aid beginning reading development had a positive significant effect on vocabulary development, reading comprehension, and total reading achievement of first-grade students. (2) Parental participation in a training program designed to train parents in methods to aid beginning reading development had no significant effect on recreational, academic, or total reading attitude of first-grade students.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //search.proquest.com/docview/304301416,NA,NA,Florida State University

Specifically, this study identified beginning mathematics achievement levels of first-grade pupils from two elementary schools at the pre-kindergarten level, kindergarten level and on-grade-level. Beginning mathematics achievement levels were determined by a pretest using the mathematics curriculum used in Richland School District One called Progress and Review in Mathematics Education (PRIME). There were two posttest measures used. PRIME was one posttest measure and the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) was used as the other posttest measure. The results of this investigation using PRIME as the pre and posttest measure showed that the first-grade pupils from the experimental school scored significantly better in mathematics achievement than the first-grade pupils from the control school when all of the first-grade pupils, pre-k level, and on-grade-level pupils were compared. Although the experimental first-grade pupils who were categorized as kindergarten level also scored better in mathematics achievement than the corresponding control group, this difference was not significant. The results of this investigation using the CTBS as the posttest measure showed that the first-grade pupils from the control school scored significantly better in mathematics achievement than the first-grade pupils from the experimental school when all first-grade pupils and the kindergarten level first-grade pupils were compared.

The project evaluated two intervention components  a two week camp for children and two training workshops for parents. Data were collected for five groups of participants. Three groups participated in one or more intervention components  parent workshops only group, child camp only group, and both parent workshops and child camp group. All children who participated in the interventions were identified by teachers as having difficulty in phonological awareness and word reading skills at the end of senior kindergarten. Two additional groups served as comparisons. Children in the 'low' comparison group had early literacy skills similar to children in the intervention groups. The 'average' comparison group included children that were identified by teachers as normally achieving in early literacy. The intervention programs sought to improve children's word reading ability by providing explicit instruction in phonological awareness and opportunities to practice other emergent literacy skills. Children participated in pre- and post-test assessments measuring literacy skills and general cognitive skills. Children in all three intervention groups showed positive change following the intervention compared to a comparison group of children with similar initial abilities who did not receive any intervention. Children who received both intervention components showed the most positive change following a follow-up assessment at the end of grade one. The frequency of home literacy activities with parents was related to positive improvement in children's phonological awareness and word reading skills. The quality of home literacy activities is also thought to be important.

Low levels of literacy and high levels of behaviour problems in middle childhood often co‐occur. These persistent difficulties pose a risk to academic and social development, leading to social exclusion in adulthood. Although parent‐training programmes have been shown to be effective in enabling parents to support their children's development, very few parent interventions offer a combination of behavioural and literacy training. Aims. This paper (1) reports on a prevention programme which aimed to tackle behaviour and literacy problems in children at the beginning of school, and (2) presents the effects of the intervention on children's literacy. Sample. One hundred and four 5‐ and 6‐year‐old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods. This is a randomized control trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. The behavioural intervention consisted of the ‘Incredible Years’ group parenting programme combined with a new programme designed to train parents to support their children's reading at home. Results. Analyses demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on children's word reading and writing skills, as well as parents' use of reading strategies with their children. Conclusion. A structured multicomponent preventive package delivered with attention to fidelity can enable parents to support their children's reading at home and increase their literacy skills. Together with the improvement in child behaviour, these changes could improve the life chances of children in disadvantaged communities.",78,3,435-455,https //doi.org/10.1348/000709907X255718,NA,NA,NA,NA

(2) Are the Planned Variation models, simply by virtue of sponsorship more effective than ordinary nonsponsored Head Start programs? and (3) Are some Planned Variation models particularly effective at imparting certain skills? The first chapter gives an overall picture of the Head Start Planned Variation study, while the second chapter summarizes data concerning background characteristics and distribution of test scores. Chapter 3 provides a general discussion of methodological issues and some of the major difficulties resulting from the study design. Chapters 4-7 attempt to present a picture of the pattern of overall effects of various programs through ranking analysis, residual analysis, analysis of covariance, and resistant analysis. The final chapters explore the question of whether the relative effectiveness of various programs is related to certain child background characteristics, such as sex, ethnicity, age, prior school experience, and mother's education. One major conclusion drawn as a result of the intermodel comparisons was that Head Start programs are quite homogeneous in their ability to promote general cognitive development.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //eric.ed.gov/?id=ED093497,Huron Institute,"Cambridge, MA",NA

The population included 166 fourth graders from two rural elementary schools in a mid-Atlantic state, their teachers, and their primary caregivers. Four classes at each school participated with two classes at each school forming the experimental group and the other two the control group. Achievement effects were determined after examination of mean score results on the pre/post researcher developed test (MWRT), comparisons between the mathematics mean scores on the 1995/1996 Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS), and comparisons between the second and third marking terms' mean grades in mathematics. Except for the area of Concepts on the MWRT, where the experimental group's mean was higher, no statistically significant mean differences in achievement between the experimental and the control groups were found. Surveys developed by the researcher were administered immediately prior to and following the study to determine primary caregivers' and teachers' opinions about primary caregiver involvement in their children's schoolwork at home. Statistically significant mean differences were found for one item which asked primary caregivers if they believed they could help their children with mathematics. Survey responses indicated that, after participation in the study, primary caregivers lost some confidence in their ability to help their children with mathematics homework. Other responses suggested primary caregivers wanted to be involved in their children's schoolwork but needed assistance from the school. Teachers indicated they needed more information on how to involve primary caregivers. Further study is recommended to examine achievement effects after using TIPS Math activities for more than one marking period. Additional study is also recommended to examine achievement effects on a variety of grade levels.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //search.proquest.com/docview/304253145,NA,NA,University of Maryland at College Park

Children in the intervention condition experienced interactive book reading at home and in the classroom as well as a classroom-based sound and letter awareness program. Children were pretested and posttested on standardized tests of language, writing, linguistic awareness, and print concepts. Effects of the intervention were significant across all children in the domains of writing and print concepts. Effects on language were large but only for those children whose primary caregivers had been actively involved in the at-home component of the program.

Positive effects at the end of Head Start obtained in the original study were replicated, and effects on emergent literacy skills in both cohorts were maintained through the end of kindergarten. Effects of the emergent literacy intervention did not generalize to literacy outcomes at the end of 1st and 2nd grades. Growth in emergent literacy skills and literacy skills from year to year was strongly influenced by variation in the Head Start centers and school districts attended by children in the sample.

The children were aged 8 to 9 yr. Analyses showed that the amount of time parents spent listening to a child read at home was positively related to both reading accuracy and comprehension scores. A short group-program training mothers as home reading tutors achieved the anticipated changes in mothers' behaviours  delayed intervention, increased use of meaning and contextual cues rather than direct word prompts, and greater use of praise. Children's reading accuracy was marginalJy improved and reading comprehension was significantly increased as a result of training the mothers as home reading tutors.

Final Report,NA,NA,Report,"The general purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of developing a Parent Participation Reading Clinic home-based instructional model for assisting in the teaching of reading to economically disadvantaged elementary school children. Working within a community-based child health care agency in Washington, D.C., the Parent Participation Reading Clinic offered an innovative model for providing remedial educational assistance to low-income educationally handicapped children through involvement of the child's parents or older sibling as a ""home-instructor"" in the teaching process. Thirty-eight elementary school children (19 experimental and 19 match control) participated in the study over an eight month period. As a group, the experimental children who participated in the program showed significant gains over the matched control group on eight month re-evaluation on the California Test of Basic Skills, vocabulary and comprehension reading sub-tests. The results indicated no significant positive effects among experimental subjects for increasing IQ scores as measured on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Significant results were found for the within group reassessment of the Wide Range Achievement Test (reading) and Dolch Word List Test. The general findings of this study are interpreted as supportive of further development of this alternative compensatory education model.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //eric.ed.gov/?id=ED072174,Children’s Hospital of the District of Columbia,"Washington, DC",NA

A Parent Involvement Program was developed in the Mesa, Arizona Title I schools to help raise the consistently low reading readiness scores of the kindergarteners in these schools. A random proportional stratified sample was selected from 14 kindergarten classrooms in five of these schools  40 students whose parents did not participate in the program and 40 students whose parents did participate. Parents received instruction twice a week in working effectively with their children,making reading games  and teaching in the kindergarten classroom one day a week. The Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on letter names was administered as a pre- and post-test (the Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on phonemes was also administered as a post-test).. Results showed that all children who were taught by the parents mastered the beginning skill of letter recognition, regardless-of-whether their- own parents-attended theParent Involvement Program. However, in the more difficult task of learning phonemes, the children whose own parents attended the program, learned more letter sounds than children whose own parents did not attend.(Cs)",NA,NA,NA,NA,https //eric.ed.gov/?id=ED104527,Mesa Public Schools,"Mesa, AZ",NA
