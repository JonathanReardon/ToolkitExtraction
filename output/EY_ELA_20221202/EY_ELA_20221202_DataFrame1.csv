68127032,Beach (2004),2004,"Although there is considerable evidence linking phonological awareness to  early reading performance, few research studies have been conducted to measure  early interventions of explicit phonological awareness instruction, including parents  as teachers, with 4- and 5-year-old prekindergarten children  among those that have  been completed, research methods have often been seriously flawed. The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who  participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which  included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level  higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression  discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a  phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The  dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological  awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills  (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to  assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16.  These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the  initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the  DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness.  Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and  duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students’ scores increased 3.3  points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these  scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that  the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in  program evaluation.

68127036,Bortnem (2005),2005,"Young children acquire new vocabulary at an amazing rate during the first five years of life. Because there is a strong relationship between language development during the early years and reading ability in the primary grades, early childhood teachers must understand language and literacy development. Children enter kindergarten in the United States with large differences in their background knowledge, vocabulary, and early literacy experiences. It is essential that early childhood programs provide quality language experiences such as read-alouds in order for children to become successful readers.  This study examined the strategy of using nonfiction interactive book read-alouds with the emergent reader in preschool to promote vocabulary development. In this quantitative study, 53 three-, four-, and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program were participants. The preschool children were assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT) as pre and posttests. The researcher read nonfiction literature to one class and fictional text to another twice per week for 12 weeks but did not read to the control group. Standardized test scores did not show significant differences in the post-test scores among the control and the two treatment groups, although all groups showed improvement in their receptive and expressive vocabularies.  In addition, a survey designed by the researcher was sent out to preschool teachers and childcare providers about the amount of time they read aloud to children, the amount of time they spend reading fiction compared to nonfiction text, and their years of teaching in early childhood and educational backgrounds.

The average age of the experimental group was less than that of the control group. The experimental group was divided into three groups on the basis of language ability. The language program required the children to describe things, listen to the language models of the teacher, and imitate those models. Pretests administered at the beginning of the 5-month program were (1) the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA), (2) the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and (3) the Irwin Articulation Test. Only the ITPA and PPVT were given as posttests. The scores of the experimental and control groups on the ITPA and PPVT did not differ significantly except on two subtests of the ITPA, both of which tested grammar skills.

The 20-week intervention consists of two 15-minute individual sessions and three 30-minute small group sessions each week. The children selected to participate in this trial were the five children in each classroom who obtained the lowest scores on a school-administered app-based assessment of oral language skills (LanguageScreen).The programme focuses on developing children’s narrative, vocabulary, and listening skills, while phonological awareness and letter sound knowledge are also developed during the second half of the programme. Training includes an initial two-day course for TAs followed by a half-day workshop half-way through the programme in addition to ongoing online support. Teachers also receive an initial half-day of training so that they can understand the programme and support TAs. This project was a randomised controlled trial  193 schools participated, 97 of which received the programme while 96 did not, the latter forming the control group.

The components of early literacy skills include oral language, phonological awareness, and print knowledge. Strong early literacy skills are crucial to later reading competency. One group of children, those with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, are particularly vulnerable to reading failure. It is possible that their struggles begin with early literacy skills. To date, researchers have yet to explore the effects of an early literacy intervention on the development of oral language skills, phonological awareness, and print knowledge in young children with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of intervention on the early literacy growth rates of young children with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. Specifically, this study addressed whether an intervention would lead to increases on measures of oral language, phonological awareness, and print knowledge. Participants in this study included 28 preschool children between 3 and 5 years of age. Fourteen children were in the treatment group and 14 children were in the comparison group. Every child was teacher nominated as having significantly more symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity as compared to peers. In addition, each child had a significant score on the Conners ’ Teacher Rating Scale - Revised  Short Form. The children in the treatment group participated in the early literacy intervention, based on the published curriculum Ladders to Literacy, 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week, for 6 weeks. Children in both the treatment and comparison groups participated in weekly individual assessments. The assessments included one oral language task, three phonological awareness tasks (Alliteration, Rhyming, and Segment Blending), and one print knowledge task (Letter Naming).

The primary questions this research aimed to answer were whether video viewing of narratives could lead to positive changes in narrative comprehension, and whether retelling could be a tool to enhance those positive changes. The study tested preschool children's narrative comprehension before and after completing a 10-day intervention involving daily interaction with narratives in either storybook or video format and, for a subset, daily retelling practice. Sixty-three 4- and 5-year-old children took part in a 10-day narrative intervention involving an initial interaction with either a print or video medium and a second experience consisting of either retelling or a repeated narrative experience. Ten additional children comprised a no-treatment control group.

67335193,Layzer (2007),2007,"This report summarizes findings from Project Upgrade, one of four experiments conducted as part of the Evaluation of Child Care Subsidy Strategies. Recognizing the need for information that would help states and communities allocate their child care subsidy funds as effectively as possible, the Child Care Bureau and the Office for Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) of the Administration for Children and Families within the US Department of Health and Human Services launched this major study in 2001. The study is being conducted by Abt Associates Inc, with its research partners MDRC and the National Center for Children in Poverty of Columbia University. The evaluation is a multi-site, multi-year effort to determine whether and how different child care subsidy policies and procedures and quality improvement efforts help low-income parents obtain and hold onto jobs and improve outcomes for children. Study staff worked with states and communities across the country to identify significant issues and develop hypotheses about the use of child care subsidy funds that could be rigorously tested in a series of experiments. A guiding principle of the study was that state (or community) interests and preferences should play a large role in the choice of research topics and strategies. The funds that flow to states through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), administered at the federal level by the Child Care Bureau have two purposes. The major portion of the funds provides subsidies for child care for children of low-income working parents whose eligibility is determined by states within broad federal guidelines. A small percentage of the funds (4%) is set aside, with state matching funds, to improve the quality of child care for all children. It was the expressed intention of the Child Care Bureau that the study generate a set of experiments that examined aspects of the use of both types of funds.

68127083,Massetti (2002),2002,"Emergent literacy consists of the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that are developmental precursors to reading and writing (Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998). The most recent federal re-authorization of Head Start placed special emphasis on children's emergent literacy skills. This new legislative mandate, as interpreted by the Head Start Bureau in information memoranda (e.g., ACYF-IM-HS-00-03), calls for Head Start grantees and delegate agencies to have enhancement of emergent literacy as a primary program goal, to augment their current self-assessment efforts by creating a system to track patterns of child and program outcomes in emergent literacy, and to use this information to inform program planning and improvement efforts. However, at this time the only readily available measures of preschool children's emergent literacy skills are standardized assessments of academic readiness. These tests can provide information about how a program as a whole is doing (e.g., average performance is at the 40th percentile), and can indicate the relative performance of individual children (e.g., a particular child is at the 30th percentile). However, such information is not particularly useful to teachers and program staff in that it does not indicate in any specific sense what each child knows, what they don't know, and what they should be taught. This project evaluated the use of a Dynamic Assessment system that Head Start teachers used to assess individual preschoolers' emergent literacy skills. Twenty classroom teaching situations were constructed that allowed teachers to emphasize emergent literacy skills while assessing individual children's performance. The Dynamic Assessment was designed to give Head Start teachers an understanding of which of their students have mastery of the materials and which need more work in that particular area while exposing children to literacy materials. In this way, teachers could target areas in which students need the most growth and could tailor experiences to individual students' needs and abilities.

67335241,O'Brien (2006),2006,"The effects of parent-delivered instruction on children's phonemic awareness were investigated. Participants were thirty-eight parents and their pre-school children. The purpose of this study was to  (1) investigate whether parents could successfully teach phoneme identification skills to preschool children  (2) assess whether the effects of parent-delivered instruction on phonemic awareness and the alphabetic principle could be independent of pretest letter knowledge, child vocabulary and cognitive ability, and SES  (3) determine whether training would generalize to recognition of untrained phonemes  and (4) assess parent satisfaction with the training and instructional program. Children were matched based on vocabulary scores. This measure was also a proxy for SES (Hart & Risley, 1995). Children were then randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups. In addition, pretest letter knowledge was assessed using experimental measures designed by Byrne and Fielding-Barnsley (1991). Parents taught their child to identify initial and ending phonemes and letter-sounds based on the early literacy program Sound Foundations (Byrne & Fielding-Barnsley, 1991), with lesson scripts based on explicit, direct instruction techniques (Kameenui & Carnine,1998  Swanson, Hoskyn & Lee, 1999). The duration of the program was 7 weeks. Children were required to find poster pictures that began or ended with the target sound and to color pictures with the target sound. Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) (Good & Kaminski, 2002) were used to measure Initial Sound Fluency and Letter Naming Fluency. Experimental measures of ending sound fluency, initial phoneme transfer and ending phoneme transfer were also used to measure outcomes. A survey was used to obtain social validity data regarding parent satisfaction with the program. Results indicated that  (a) there was a large, albeit insignificant effect for parent training on children's initial sound fluency (d = 1.1, p < .006)  (b) parent training was not predictive of letter naming fluency (p =.07)  (c) there were no significant differences on measures of phoneme transfer  and (d) pretest letter knowledge was predictive of outcomes on letter naming fluency (p < .01). Parents reported a high degree of satisfaction with training.

This study examined the effects of a twelve week supplementary classroom literacy program on the emergent literacy skills of Head Start children. Ten classrooms of four year olds attending Head Start were randomly assigned to an intervention condition which involved the supplementary curriculum, or to a control condition which involved the regular Head Start curriculum. Children in the intervention classrooms received direct and explicit instruction in prereading skills which was delivered very systematically through developmentally appropriate practices. Children were pretested and posttested on a variety of language, literacy, and memory measures. Effects of the intervention were significant in the area of phonological awareness. Children's linguistic skill in recognizing and manipulating the phonemic segments in words was enhanced through activities, games, children's songs, and book reading involving rhyming, alliteration, and phoneme blending. Children in all classroom showed substantial improvement from pre- to posttest on Letter identification, letter-sound correspondence, word identification, and print conventions. Language of origin (whether participants spoke English or were bilingual) also affected performance on some of the measures. English speaking children tended to perform better on alliteration and phoneme blending tasks than bilingual children. An apparent language effect was also found on a measure of sentence memory. Results from the study have important implications vis-a-vis the controversy over the kinds of experiences children should have in their early schooling. This study demonstrates that direct and explicit classroom instruction which promotes phonological awareness and precursor reading skills can successfully occur at the preschool level in a developmentally appropriate manner. Thus, it provides information and guidance to practitioners about creating preschool opportunities for lower-income families that support literacy development and that address reading risk factors.",['EY_Early literacy approaches'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Doctor of Psychology[¬e]""']",NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],"['Page 49:\n[¬s]""preschoolers from a Head Start program i[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""attending Head Start[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['4', '3', '5']","['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Ten classrooms of four year olds[¬e]""', 'Page 49:\n[¬s]""between the ages o f three and five[¬e]""']",NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,,5,"['Page 50:\n[¬s]""These procedures resulted in two foU-day classrooms and three halfday\nclassrooms included in the intervention group[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 50:\n[¬s]""and one foU-day classroom and four half\xad\nday classrooms included in the control group[¬e]""']",,10,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Ten classrooms of four yea[¬e]""', 'Page 50:\n[¬s]""The tenth classroom was assigned""\n""Nine of the ten classrooms were assigned[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Ten classrooms of four year olds attending Head Start were randomly\nassigned to an intervention condition which involved the supplementary curriculum, or\nto a control condition which involved the regular Head Start curriculum.[¬e]""']",NA,,Class,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Ten classrooms of four year olds attending Head Start were randomly\nassigned[¬e]""']",NA,,['Cluster RCT'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Ten classrooms of four year olds attending Head Start were randomly\nassigned to an intervention condition which involved the supplementary curriculum, or\nto a control condition which involved the regular Head Start curriculum[¬e]""']",NA,,Yes,"['Page 50:\n[¬s]""Nine of the ten classrooms were assigned to intervention and control\nconditions in a quasi-random fashion.

68127105,Simon (2003),2003,"The development of language and literacy skills is vital to future success in our society. Early intervention in critical areas of preschool language (vocabulary, comprehension, and narrative ability) and early literacy skills can facilitate this development. Typical interventions in preschool settings utilize storybooks to target these critical areas. However, research on large group teacher implemented storybook interventions to improve language skills is limited. In this study, Head Start teachers were trained to use a storybook intervention entitled, Storybook Activities for Improving Language (SAIL). The SAIL intervention consisted of four days of teacher led activities built around storybooks incorporating repeated readings, vocabulary activities, and retelling and acting out activities. A main focus was on vocabulary skills with secondary focuses on comprehension, narrative ability, and print awareness. Language and early literacy measures were administered at pre and post test to the SAIL intervention group and a control group. A multivariate analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effectiveness of SAIL on those measures. A significant effect was found for a vocabulary measure requiring children to name the categories and features of the target vocabulary words used in the SAIL intervention and for a narrative retell measure requiring children to retell a story within a time limit. There were no significant effects found for vocabulary measures assessing general vocabulary development, comprehension, or print awareness. Based on the results, five conclusions can be drawn  (a) the SAIL intervention led to increases in vocabulary skills  (b) the SAIL intervention did not lead to increases in comprehension skills  (c) the SAIL intervention led to increases in narrative ability  (d) SAIL did not lead to increases in print awareness  and (e) teachers rated the SAIL intervention favorably upon a program evaluation questionnaire. Despite limitations warranting caution in interpretation, this study added to existing research on storybook interventions in preschool in several ways. First, SAIL showed that a class-wide teacher implemented storybook intervention led to significant gains in vocabulary skills and narrative ability for preschool age children.

The expectation is that 80% of Year 6 children will achieve Level 4 or above within the National Curriculum. This is seen to represent ‘zero tolerance of failure’. However, another interpretation of ‘zero tolerance of failure’ is that all children, including the 20% who are predicted to experience difficulties, will reach ageand skill‐appropriate targets in reading. This is the goal adopted for the Early Reading Research (ERR) reported in this article. The aims of the ERR are to investigate  (i) whether overall reading standards can be improved and (ii) the extent to which reading difficulties can be prevented. Despite all the recent research into phonological awareness and its relationship to reading, there has been very little research into how phonological skills are taught within a broader literacy framework to enable children both to increase their attainments and to prevent the occurrence of problems in learning to read. The ERR is a 2‐year study following a sample of 433 children as they progress from reception into Year 1. This article reviews recent psychological research on teaching reading, discusses the significance of instructional psychology and reports on the first year of the research when children were in six experimental reception classes implementing the ERR reading framework or six comparison schools following their usual approaches for teaching reading.

However, there is controversy as to the best means of promoting the development of these skills in the classroom. Through comparisons with control classrooms, the current study evaluated the effectiveness of a commercially available early-reading teaching program (Jolly Phonics - Lloyd, 1993) which combines these key elements. Time-sampling observations of experimental and control classrooms were undertaken to investigate which literacy components were related to reading and spelling success. Midway through the school year, children in 10 experimental and 10 control semor kindergarten classes (265 participants) were pretested on phonological awareness and early literacy measures to ensure group comparability. Classroom observations took place throughout the spring. At the end of the year children were tested on phonological awareness, and on a range of reading and spelling measures. Results showed that on 16 of the 19 measures including complex literacy skill knowledge (alphabetic coding) and application (reading and spelling both real words and nonwords), the experimental group significantly (and practically--i.e., most effect sizes were large) outperformed the control children. In addition, the performance of children considered to be ""at-risk"" for future reading failure (determined by very low pretest letter-naming scores) was analyzed. Results showed that this subsample of children also benefited from the Jolly Phonics program and outperformed their at-risk control counterparts. Furthermore, on most measures, the at-risk experimental group performed as well as the control children who were designated as having average literacy skills (and on one measure, scored significantly higher), thus, appearing to have changed their at-risk status. Correlational and multiple regression analyses found several links to literacy achievement, with the Phonics Literacy Component being the strongest predictor, followed by time Tent involved in letter formation.

Early phonological processing skills are strongly related to progress in early literacy and phonological processing deficits are found related to specific reading disability. Thirty children aged 5.1–6.0 (15 in each of two schools) were assigned to an experimental or control group and compared before and after a 12-week intervention on measures of phonological processing skills and reading. There were no pretreatment differences between groups. The experimental intervention was based on findings of (a) early developmental phases in phonological recoding, (b) reciprocal development between phoneme awareness and phonological recoding, and (c) reciprocal development between phonological processing skills and early reading. The instruction was designed to facilitate the gradually expanding use of letter-phoneme relationships in early reading and spelling. The results indicated that, at posttest, the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group on the measures of phonological processing skills and in reading.

Although children in the sample began formal reading instruction with relatively low levels of emergent literacy skills, they showed substantial gains with respect to national norms by the end of 2nd grade.",['EY_Early literacy approaches'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""Head Start centers[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4']","['Page 3:\n[¬s]""hildren in the original cohort\nwere a subset of those included in the report by Whitehurst,\nEpstein, et al.
