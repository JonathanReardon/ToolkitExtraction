When the child acted as a speaker, the experimenter pointed to the referent picture and asked that the child assist the listener in identifying the picture by telling the listener only what was necessary to select the referent. Each message was followed by interrogative-cognitive feedback (see Lefebvre-Pinard & Reid, 1980; Lefebvre-Pinard, et al., 1982). The child progressively corrected and reformulated the initial message until it included only contrastive attributes. Even when the child’s message was contrastive, feedback was provided and aimed at centering the child\'s attention on contrastive actribute(s). During the second half of the session, the child acred as a listener and the confederate as a speaker. In each of these exercises, the child was given the complete sequence of messages he had produced as a speaker. If the child as a speaker had not provided systematic feedback following the confederate’s messages, the same sequence of feedback that had been provided during the initial phase of the session was repeated by the experimenter. It should be stressed that this part of the training did not aim at systematically inducing listener’s skills but rather at sensitizing the child to the requirements of an adequate message. Members of the passive-feedback group (Group 2) observed the two com\xad plete training sessions of the Group 1 child with whom they had been matched on age and sex. They were always seated on the same side of the table as the Group I members. Both groups had access to exactly the same amount of visual information. Because each of the three series of training exercises included two different exercises for each level of difficulty, children in the active/passive- feedback group (Group 3) were given one exercise using the active method, and the other using the passive method.
