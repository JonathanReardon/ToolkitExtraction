Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\r\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools). Peers will normally be of similar age and socio-economic or cultural background.\r\rUniversity students tutoring primary school pupils would not usually be classified as 'peers'.","AttributeType":"Not

(2016) a school-based non-randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the eﬀect of a pilot PEP on preschool children’s gross motor skills (Gallahue et al., 2003, 2012; McGee et al., 2016). This study has been recently developed within the Training-to- Health Project ﬁnanced by Municipality of Palermo. Due to funding requirements, PEP was carried out in several pilot preschools within the Palermo City Council administrative boundaries. A preschool with demographic characteristics (age, sex, socioeconomic characteristics) similar to the enrolled playschools was recruited in Palermo and used as the control. In particular, the catchment areas of these schools were predominately of middle socioeconomic status as judged by employment and education.\"\n\"This study involved 119 children who were clustered in a control group [CG, n = 29, age: 52.1 ± 8.65 months; height: 1.10 ± 0.07 m, body weight: 19.20 ± 5.55 kg, body mass index (BMI): 16.90 ± 3.16] and an intervention group (IG, n = 90, age: 57.4 ± 9.42 months; height: 1.10 ± 0.06 m, body weight: 19.30 ± 3.65 kg, BMI: 16.00 ± 1.75). Moreover, 62.10% males and 37.90% females composed the CG. Similarly, 55.60% males and 44.40% females composed the IG. The study was approved by the Ethical Board of the University of Palermo (N. 2/2018) and conformed to criteria for the use of persons in research as deﬁned in the Declaration of Helsinki (Trial Registration: NCT03454061 retrospectively registered 2 March 2018). Given that the participants were minors, parents or legal guardians provided their written informed consent to participate in this research. All children participated voluntarily and could withdraw from the study at any time.\"\n\"The PEP, based on the psychomotor approach, was done in a group setting and based on useful, goal-directed training, practicing activities of relevance for a preschool child. The program lasted 16 weeks and was applied twice a week by a physical education specialist (PES), who also had experience with preschool children. Teachers were involved in the goal- setting process and cooperated with PES to carry over the activities safely. Before intervention, PES and teachers have followed a training course concerning the aims, methodology and evaluation of PEP in order to make the intervention uniform for all children. PEP included activities with speciﬁc aims developing body awareness, fundamental motor and perceptual-sensory skills of preschool children (see Figure 1).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Battaglia etal_2019.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":918723,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"The\naim of this study was to investigate whether the quotient of gross motor development\n(QGMD) and pre-literacy skills concerning visual analysis and spatial orientation abilities\nchanged after 16 weeks of PEP (2 h/week) in preschool children.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Battaglia etal_2019.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":918723,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"a school-based\nnon-randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the eﬀect\nof a pilot PEP on preschool children’s gross motor skills[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Battaglia etal_2019.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":918723,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"We conducted a\nschool-based non-randomized pilot trial.

Unfortunately, in Italy, the physical education teacher is not included in the school\\u0027s core personnel, and it is very hard to find a specific physical education program (PEP) that could improve preschool children\\u0027s motor and cognitive status. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the quotient of gross motor development (QGMD) and pre-literacy skills concerning visual analysis and spatial orientation abilities changed after 16 weeks of PEP (2 h/week) in preschool children. We conducted a school-based non-randomized pilot trial. It involved 119 preschool children, clustered in a control group [CG, n = 29, body mass index (BMI): 16.90 ± 3.16 Kg/m2] and an intervention group (IG, n = 90, BMI: 16.00 ± 1.75 kg/m2). Participants were assessed for literacy readiness, locomotor and object control skills before and after the experimental period. IG increased the locomotor, object-control skills and QGMD in response to PEP. As concerns the pre-literacy domain, no significant difference was found in visual analysis and spatial orientation skills between IG and CG groups. However, we detected improvements from baseline to post-test in IG children. In conclusion, this study contributes additional evidence suggesting how a PEP could affect not only motor skills, but also cognitive ones. Consistently with the growing research, interventions based on structured ludic-motor activities ensure health benefits for preschool children.

The Move 2 Learn (M2L) program is an evidence-based intervention designed to improve movement and pre-literacy skills in children ages 1.5–6 years. Purpose: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as delivered by non-experts in a community-based setting. Methods: Staff from four community centers were trained to implement M2L. Two sites were evaluated using a quasi-experimental design and the remaining two were evaluated using a pre–post design. Movement and pre-literacy skills were assessed twice in all children. Implementation fidelity was assessed using a weekly checklist and through site-visits. Results: Thirty-one children (15 girls and 16 boys; age range 23–53 months) participated in the study. The results of the quasi-experimental study (n = 17) showed that there was an overall effect of the program on time 2 total gross motor scores (standardized beta = 1.3, p \\u003c.05) but not pre-literacy scores, specifically print or alphabet knowledge. The pre–post design (n = 14) showed significant change over time for total gross motor scores (Cohen’s d = 1.78) and print knowledge (Cohen’s d = 1.76). Conclusions: Overall, the M2L program seems to have had a positive impact on participants when delivered in a community setting by trained, non-expert leaders. Future research will need to evaluate the effectiveness of the program delivered by various educators in larger and more diverse samples of children, using more robust research designs, and to determine whether there is long-term effect of M2L on health and academic outcomes in children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bedard Chloe ; Bremer Emily ; Cairney John ; Cairney John ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/17408989.2019.1690645","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bedard Chloe, Bremer Emily, Cairney John, and Cairney John (2020) Evaluation of the Move 2 Learn program, a community-based movement and pre-literacy intervention for young children.

movement is critical to young children's development, there is an ongoing debate about the time devoted to teaching movement in early childhood classrooms. Nevertheless, research has established a link between specific precursor motor skills and early literacy development. This study investigated the synergistic effect of practising specific movements through daily actions and songs alongside the explicit teaching of phonological awareness and phonics in 400 preschool children (aged between four and five). Results indicate that students who received the combined intervention of explicit phonological awareness and movement were the only group to perform significantly better than the control group on measures of phonological awareness, invented spelling and spelling. An interesting outcome was that the literacy/movement group and not the movement group made significantly larger gains for the movement measure. These findings suggest that teaching pre-primary aged children early literacy and movement in tandem is more beneficial than teaching either in isolation.","Comments":"*Please compare Movement vs Control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Callcott Deborah ; Hammond Lorraine ; Hill Susan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-014-0652-7","Keywords":"Early childhood\r\nMovement\r\nPhonics\r\nPhonological awareness\r\nSpelling Introduction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Callcott Deborah, Hammond Lorraine, and Hill Susan (2015) The synergistic effect of teaching a combined explicit movement and phonological awareness program to preschool aged students.

The child was asked to (a) count forward and (b) count back-\nwards from given numbers and continue counting until the experimenter said ‘stop’ at a specific\nnumeral. The following sequences were used to count forward: 3–8; 7–12; 14–19; 18–24; 26–32; 47–\n53; 90–94; and 96–102 (8 tasks). Test–retest reliability was r = .92.

The number of correctly answered sequences was the dependent measure. Test–retest\nreliability was r = .91.\nNaming Arabic numbers. Three sets of written Arabic numbers were presented to the children one\nat a time. The first set contained numerals from 1to 9, the second set numerals from 10 to 20, and the\nlast set numerals from 21 to 99. In total, 30 different numerals. The numbers were presented randomly\nand in the same way to all children, and the children were asked to name the numbers.

Each child was asked to draw a hatch-mark on each number line to mark the position\nof a given number (number line 0–10). One demonstration and one practice task were presented\nbefore starting. The experimenter asked the child ‘If this is 0 (pointing) and this is 10 (pointing),\nwhere does N go?’, where N is the number of interest. When the children were presented with a\nnumber line of 0–100 they were given a hatch-mark. Then they were asked to tell what number\nthe hatch-mark was placed on. The dependent measure used is mean error between the estimations\nand the actual value. The test–retest reliability was r = .91.\nVerbal arithmetic\nVerbal addition and subtraction.

order to give all children equal opportunities in school, methods to prevent early differences are needed. The overall aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two structured teaching methods: Math in Action, characterised by physical activity and music, and common numerical activities. Children (28 girls, 25 boys) were assigned to 1 of the 2 conditions during a period of 3 weeks (2 times a week for a 30-minute session). The results show that children who learn mathematics in an environment characterised by physical activity and music develop their mathematical abilities significantly more than children who learn mathematics through common number activities. We have also shown that children with different motor skill abilities benefit from learning mathematics in an environment characterised by physical activity and music.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Elofsson Jessica ; Englund Bohm Anna; Jeppsson Catarina ; Samuelsson Joakim ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03004279.2016.1273250","Keywords":"Mathematics\r\nlearning\r\nmusical activity\r\nphysical activity\r\nteaching","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Elofsson Jessica, Englund Bohm Anna, Jeppsson Catarina, and Samuelsson Joakim (2018) Physical activity and music to support pre-school children’s mathematics learning.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a 6 month, low cost, teacher-directed, academic program that delivered existing literacy lessons using physical activity in Head Start preschools. Preschool Literacy Individual Growth and Development Indicators were used to assess early literacy and phonological awareness in the areas of alliteration and picture naming. The results showed significant increases in physical activity during free play and improvements in early literacy (Picture Naming, Alliteration) compared to a non-exercising control group. In conclusion, the findings suggest that academic lessons taught using physical activity improve early literacy in preschoolers.","Comments":"Please focus in coding 3 months post intervention.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kirk Stacie M; Vizcarra Coleman R; Looney Erin C; Kirk Erik P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-013-0596-3","Keywords":"Academic achievement\r\nEarly literacy\r\nHead Start\r\nPicture naming\r\nPreschool","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kirk Stacie M, Vizcarra Coleman R, Looney Erin C, and Kirk Erik P (2014) Using physical activity to teach academic content: A study of the effects on literacy in Head Start preschoolers.

To increase the likelihood of dissemination in other Head Start centers, the activities were designed to be administered by classroom teacherswhile being fun and engaging for preschool children. A variety of early literacy lessons were used in the areas of picture naming (assessment of expressive language development), rhyming, and alliteration (assessment of phonological awareness).\"\n\"For example, a goal of a rhyming lesson was for\nchildren to ﬁnd the rhymeswithin a particular poem or\nshort story. The activity was designed to help children\nunderstand and identify rhyming words. During the\nlesson, children would march in place while the\nteacher repeated several lines of a poem and the child\nidentiﬁed the words that rhymed. Depending on the\nwords that rhymed, the children would either act out\nthe words or perform a certain number of jumping\njacks (or other movement) before moving on to the\nnext 2 lines of the poem and repeating the sequence\nthroughout the poem. Whereas these concepts were\ncovered at both the intervention and control site,\nthe primary difference was that the intervention site\nintegrated these lessons into a PA rather than teach\nsolely through large-group time, reading, or other\nclassroom activities.\nThe program was designed to keep the children\nmoving in moderate PA for 30 minutes 2 times per day\n(60minutes daily). Sixty minutes per day of moderate\nintensity PA was chosen as it is recommended by the\nNational Association for Sport and Physical Education\n(NASPE)26 and the National Association for the\nEducation of Young Children (NAEYC).27 Despite\nthese recommendations most preschool children\ndo not meet these recommendations28 Therefore,\nintegrating PA within the early literacy curriculum\ncould be an effective way to increase daily PA. The\nprogram was administered inside or outside of the\nclassroom, to music or without music. The goal was\nto make it fun and engaging for both the teachers\nand students. Teachers were free to choose the time\neach morning and afternoon that best ﬁt into the\nday’s schedule but each teacher was required to\nadminister a morning and afternoon session at a\ntime when it was likely that most if not all students\nwere in attendance (eg, after breakfast in the AM\nbut before children are picked up by parents in\nPM). During the 8 months, daily direct observation\nby the investigators was used to ensure that the PA\nlessons were administered appropriately. Throughout\nthe study, teachers in the intervention group were\nrequired to complete a daily activity log. To complete\nthe log, teachers indicated in which PA lesson was\nused, the time of day they performed the activity\nlesson, the total number of minutes that each activity\nlasted, and estimate the intensity level at which they\nbelieved the children were performing (ie, light-,\nmoderate-, or high-intensity levels). An e-mail was\nsent each week to the intervention teachers to remind\nthem to complete the activity logs.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kirk etal, 2016.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215245,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":553551,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"A 2-group, quasi-experimental design with 1\npreschool site participating in the PA intervention\n(1 preschool, 2 classrooms, N=39 F, N=25, M,\nN=14) and a second site participating as the control\nsite (1 preschool, 2 classrooms, N=15, F, N=12 F,\nM, N=3) was used.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kirk etal, 2016.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215253,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":553551,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"arents provided written assent for their\nchildren and the children provided verbal consent.\nAll students (N=56) in both classrooms were eligible\nto, and did participate.

Early literacy and language skills were measured using the Early Literacy Indi- vidual Growth and Development Indicators (IGDI — Research and development of individual growth and development indicators for children between birth and age 8; Tech. Rep. No. 4, 1998). Picture Naming (mea- sure of oral language and vocabulary), Rhyming,and Alliteration (measures of phonological awareness) are commonly used as indicators of children’s language and literacy development in preschool programs.\"\n\"Picture-naming individual growth and development\nindicator. Administration of the picture-naming indi-\nvidual growth and development indicator (PN IGDI)\nis completed by presenting children with color pic-\ntures (photographs or line drawings) of objects found\nin natural environments, including home (eg, cake,\nsink), classroom (eg, glue, book), and community\n(eg, rabbit, train). The children were told to name\npictures as quickly as possible. The number of pic-\ntures named correctly in 1 minute was the child’s\nscore. If the child did not respond to any given pic-\nture within 3 seconds, the examiner gave a prompt\nby saying ‘‘What’s that?’’ or ‘‘Do you know what this\nis?’’ and allowed the child an additional 2 seconds to\nrespond before moving to the next card. Items were\nselected from a set of approximately 120 pictured\nobjects. Examiners were instructed to use 4 standard\nsample cards (to demonstrate the task and conﬁrm the\nchild’s understanding of the task), and then to admin-\nister a randomly selected set of 1-50 cards. Hierarchical\nlinear modeling (HLM) results centered at 66 months\nof age showed an average PN score of 19 with an\naverage gain of .28 pictures per month for children liv-\ning in low-income environments.20 Picture naming is\nsensitive to preschoolers’ growing expressive language\nskills, with signiﬁcant correlations in typically devel-\noping children (R=.63, p<.001), children enrolled in\nHead Start (R=.32, p<.05), and children with dis-\nabilities receiving services in early childhood special\neducation classrooms (R=.48, p<.001).2\"\n\"Rhyming individual growth and development\nindicator. Administration of the rhyming individual\ngrowth and development indicator (RH IGDI) is\ncompleted by presenting a child with a series of cards.\nEach card shows four pictures: at the top is a picture\ndepicting the stimulus word (eg, bees) and under the\nstimulus picture is a row of 3 other pictures (eg, house,\npants, cheese) with 1 correct and 2 incorrect responses.\nFor each card the examiner points to and says the name\nof each picture and tells the child to ‘‘point to the\npicture that sounds the same as the top picture.’’ After\ndemonstration (2 standard cards) and practice items\n(4 randomly selected cards), the examiner shows a\nrandom selection of cards for 2 minutes. A child’s\nscore is the number of correctly identiﬁed rhymes in\n2minutes. HLM centered at 53months of age showed\nan average RH score of 6.5 with an average growth\nof .38 rhymes per month for children living in low-\nincome families.21 Research has indicated moderate\nto high correlations between rhyming and picture\nnaming IGDI (R=.46 to .63, p<.01) 21 and alliteration\nIGDI (R=.43).21\nAlliteration individual growth and development\nindicator. Alliteration is similar to the other 2 IGDI’s\nin that it uses stimulus cards and the child’s score\nis the number correct during a timed administration.\nThe alliteration individual growth and development\nindicator (AL IGDI) cards depict 4 pictures: at the top\nis a picture depicting the stimulus word (eg, cake)\nand under the stimulus picture is a row of 3 other\npictures (eg, cat, sink, bear) with 1 correct and 2\nincorrect responses. The child is told to ‘‘Look at the\npictures and ﬁnd the ones that start with the same\nsound.’’ For each card the examiner names all the\npictures for the child. After demonstration (2 standard\ncards) and practice items (4 randomly selected cards),\nthe examiner showed a random selection of cards for\n2minutes, counting the number correct in that time\nas the child’s score. HLM centered at 53months of age\nshowed an average AL score of 4.3 with an average\ngrowth of .25 alliterations per month for children\nliving in low-income families.20 Alliteration correlates\nwith other early literacy development (R= .75to.79,\np< .01).2[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kirk etal, 2016.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215544,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215545,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":553551,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Each classroom was staffed with 2 teachers (1\nlead teacher and 1 assistant teacher).

The effects of increases in physical activity (PA) on early literacy skills in preschool children are not known. METHODS: Fifty-four African-American preschool children from a low socioeconomic urban Head Start participated over 8 months. A 2-group, quasi-experimental design was used with one preschool site participating in the PA intervention and a second site participating as the control site. The PA program was designed to promote 300 minutes/week of moderate to vigorous PA academic lessons. Academic achievement related to early literacy and phonological awareness in the areas of rhyming and alliteration were assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 months. RESULTS: Over 8 months, rhyming significantly (p < .01) improved in the PA group (173±12%) compared with the controls (28 ± 8%) resulting in between group differences at 8 months (p < .01). Alliteration significantly (p < .01) improved in the PA group (52 ± 16%) compared with controls (13 ± 5%), resulting in between group differences at 8 months (p < .01). As minutes of exposure to moderate to vigorous PA increased, the change in picture naming (R2 = .35, p < .05), alliteration (R2 = .38, p < .05), and rhyming (R2 = .42, p < .05), increased. CONCLUSION: A teacher-directed PA program is effective at increasing PA and improving early literacy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kirk Stacie M; Kirk Erik P; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.12363","Keywords":"African Americans\r\nChildcare/daycare\r\nHead Start\r\nLanguage/speech\r\nPreschool curriculum","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kirk Stacie M, and Kirk Erik P (2016) Sixty minutes of physical activity per day included within preschool academic lessons improves early literacy.

Procedure Children from sixteen kindergarten classes served as subjects for the study. Eight classes were randomly selected for the experimental program; the other eight classes served as control subjects. The experimental program consisted of prescribed gross motor activities for one-half hour daily over an eight-w eek period. Eight teachers participated. Each had one control and one experimental c lass randomly• assigned to a morning or afternoon session . The Pintner-Cunningham Primary Test was used to determine mental ages of the su b jects. The Perceptual Forms Test and Form A of the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were used as pre and post measurements of readiness for reading. Treatment of Data Scores earned on the pre- and post-tests of the Perceptual Forms Test and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests were treated by analysis of covariance technique. Adjusted post-test means were given an F -test for statistical significance. Differences with .05 levels of significance were the basis for rejecting null hypotheses. Findings 1. On both criterion tests, the adjusted post-test means earned by the experimental group exceeded those earned by the control group. The differences were significant at the .05 lev el. The null hypothesis was rejected. 2. On both criterion tests, the differences between the adjusted post-test means earned by experimental boys and experimental girls were not significant at the .05 level. The null hypothesis was accepted. 3. On both criterion tests, the differences between the adjusted post-test means earned by experimental subjects above and experimental subjects below the median chronological age were not significant at the .05 level. The null hypothesis was accepted. 4. On both criterion tests, the adjusted post-test means earned by experimental subjects above the median mental age exceeded those earned by experimental subjects below the median mental age. The differences were significant at the .05 level. The null hypothesis was rejected. Conclusions Subject to the limitations of the study, it was concluded that the inclusion of a systematic program of gross motor activities in the curriculum of kindergarten children had the following effects: 1. It significantly improved their readiness for reading. 2. It improved the reading readiness of boys and girls to a similar degree.","Comments":"ESDE: Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test as Toollkit Primary Outcome using the adjusted post-test outcomes (Table 4) and the SDs from p 80.

In this study, the learning effects of enacting words through whole-body movements (i.e., physical exercise) and part-body movements (i.e., gestures) were investigated in a foreign language vocabulary task. Participants were 111 preschool children of 15 childcare centers, who were randomly assigned to one of four conditions. Participants had to learn 14 Italian words in a 4-week teaching program. They were tested on their memory for the words during, directly after, and 6 weeks after the program. In the integrated physical exercise condition, children enacted the actions indicated by the words to be learned in physical exercises. In the non-integrated physical exercise condition children performed physical exercises at the same intensity, but unrelated to the learning task. In the gesturing condition, children enacted the actions indicated by the words to be learned by gesturing while remaining seated. In the conventional condition, children verbally repeated the words while remaining seated. Results confirmed the main hypothesis, indicating that children in the integrated physical exercise condition achieved the highest learning outcomes. Implications of integrated physical exercise programs for preschool children’s cognition and health are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mavilidi Myrto Foteini; Okely Anthony D; Chandler Paul ; Cliff Dylan P; Paas Fred ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-015-9337-z","Keywords":"Gesturing\r\nLearning\r\nPhysical exercise\r\nPreschool children","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mavilidi Myrto Foteini, Okely Anthony D, Chandler Paul, Cliff Dylan P, and Paas Fred (2015) Effects of integrated physical exercises and gestures on preschool children’s foreign language vocabulary learning.

Eight childcare centers with 87 four-to-five-year-old children were randomly assigned across an integrated physical activity condition, an unintegrated physical activity condition, and a control condition without physical activity. Children learned the names and a typical animal from each of the six continents using a floor-mounted world map with soft toy animals. Both learning conditions with physical activities showed higher performance than the learning condition without physical activities on an immediate retention test, and on a delayed retention test administered five weeks later. In addition, children in the physical activity conditions (integrated and nonintegrated) enjoyed their learning method the most. Infusing task-relevant physical activities into the classroom and the learning task is discussed as a promising way to improve children's learning, enjoyment, and health.","Comments":"There are 2 PA conditions.

Eight childcare centers with 87 four-to-five-year-old children were randomly assigned across an integrated physical activity condition, an unintegrated physical activity condition, and a control condition without physical activity. Children learned the names and a typical animal from each of the six continents using a floor-mounted world map with soft toy animals. Both learning conditions with physical activities showed higher performance than the learning condition without physical activities on an immediate retention test, and on a delayed retention test administered five weeks later. In addition, children in the physical activity conditions (integrated and nonintegrated) enjoyed their learning method the most. Infusing task-relevant physical activities into the classroom and the learning task is discussed as a promising way to improve children's learning, enjoyment, and health.","Comments":"There are 2 PA conditions.

A total of 90 children from seven childcare centres (Mage = 4.90, SD = 0.52; 45 girls) were randomly assigned across an integrated physical activity condition including task-relevant physical activities, a nonintegrated physical activity condition involving task-irrelevant physical activities, or a control condition involving the predominantly conventional sedentary style of teaching. Children learned the names of the planets and their order, based on the distance from the sun. For both the immediate and delayed (6 weeks after the programme) assessments, results showed that learning outcomes were highest in the integrated condition and higher in the nonintegrated condition than in the control condition. Children in the integrated condition scored higher on perceived enjoyment of learning than children in the control condition. Implications of integrated physical activity programmes for preschool children's health, cognition, and learning are further discussed.

A total of 90 children from seven childcare centres (Mage = 4.90, SD = 0.52; 45 girls) were randomly assigned across an integrated physical activity condition including task-relevant physical activities, a nonintegrated physical activity condition involving task-irrelevant physical activities, or a control condition involving the predominantly conventional sedentary style of teaching. Children learned the names of the planets and their order, based on the distance from the sun. For both the immediate and delayed (6 weeks after the programme) assessments, results showed that learning outcomes were highest in the integrated condition and higher in the nonintegrated condition than in the control condition. Children in the integrated condition scored higher on perceived enjoyment of learning than children in the control condition. Implications of integrated physical activity programmes for preschool children's health, cognition, and learning are further discussed.

Speciﬁcally, children were asked\nhow much they liked the type of instruction (‘‘Did you like this game?”) and whether they would like\nto be taught this way in the future (‘‘Would you like to play it again in the future?”). This scale was\nadapted from the studies of Mavilidi, Okely, Chandler, and Paas (2016, 2017). A coefﬁcient alpha of\n.75 was obtained for these questions in this study.\nPhysical activity measure. During the learning sessions, children’s physical activity was measured\nusing an ActiGraph accelerometer (model GT1M, Pensacola, FL) worn around the waist on an elastic\nbelt with the accelerometer positioned over the anterior aspect of the right hip. Accelerometers are\ninstruments designed to measure time-speciﬁc acceleration used for physical activity assessments.\nActiGraphs have established utility, validity, and reliability in children aged 3–5 years (Cliff, Reilly,\n& Okely, 2009). Parents were informed via participant information sheets that children would wear\naccelerometers during the learning sessions. An accelerometer was placed on each child by the\nresearcher at the beginning of the learning session and was removed at the end. Accelerometer data\nwere processed using ActiLife version 6.12.1 software and were recorded for the scheduled 10-min\ntime period. Only activity during lesson times was recorded. The epoch length was set at 1-s intervals,\na time that is recommended for use in preschool children, and age-appropriate cut-points were used\nto deﬁne intensity of activity (Pate, Almeida, McIver, Pfeiffer, & Dowda, 2006). The magnitude of the\nrecorded accelerations over an epoch was measured in activity counts as an estimate of total physical\nactivity data (Cliff et al., 2009). Cut-points were set at  25 counts/15 s for sedentary behavior and at\n!420 counts/15 s for moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activities. These cut-points have been\nshown to be the most accurate in young children (Janssen et al., 2013). Data were reported as minutes\nspent in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and the average activity counts per\nminute, representing the average intensity activity during the lesson.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Mavilidi (2018).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215572,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215580,"AdditionalText":"implied","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215518,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":557963,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"15min per day for 4 weeks (\"\n\"The learning sessions occurred once per week and lasted 15min per day for 4 weeks[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Mavilidi (2018).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215517,"AdditionalText":"4 ","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":557963,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"for 4 weeks[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Mavilidi (2018).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215519,"AdditionalText":"15 ","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":557963,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"The learning sessions occurred once per week and lasted 15min per day for 4 weeks[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Mavilidi (2018).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215523,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215529,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215533,"AdditionalText":"this study was a University intervention project, developer undertook the evaluation","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":557963,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"Math outcome measures\nThe assessments, adapted from Ramani and Siegler (2008), consisted of a pretest, an immediate\nposttest, and a delayed posttest.

Participants (N = 120, Mage = 4.70 years, SD = 0.49; 57 girls) were assigned to one of the following four conditions: performing integrated physical activity (task relevant), performing nonintegrated physical activity (task nonrelevant), observing integrated physical activity, or conventional sedentary teaching (without performing or observing physical activity). Results showed that children who performed task-relevant integrated physical activity performed better than children in all other conditions. In addition, children who performed physical activity, either integrated or nonintegrated, reported higher scores for enjoyment of the instructional method than the two sedentary learning conditions. Implications for educational theory and practice are discussed.","Comments":"This study has 4 conditions.

Participants (N = 120, Mage = 4.70 years, SD = 0.49; 57 girls) were assigned to one of the following four conditions: performing integrated physical activity (task relevant), performing nonintegrated physical activity (task nonrelevant), observing integrated physical activity, or conventional sedentary teaching (without performing or observing physical activity). Results showed that children who performed task-relevant integrated physical activity performed better than children in all other conditions. In addition, children who performed physical activity, either integrated or nonintegrated, reported higher scores for enjoyment of the instructional method than the two sedentary learning conditions. Implications for educational theory and practice are discussed.","Comments":"This study has 4 conditions.

The sample consisted of 217 (girls = 111, boys = 106) kindergarten students from 12 intact physical education classes. Six licensed physical educators volunteered to participate in the study. Each teacher was responsible for two kindergarten classes. One class was randomly assigned for the experimental group while the other was assigned to the control group. The experimental design of this study was a two-group pretest-posttest design. Data were collected using two types of instrumentation: (a) a locomotor movement critical element checklist, and (b) a literacy variable checklist. A 2-way MANOVA analysis was used to detect significant gain differences among the two groups and gender for the three variables of locomotor movement skill development, letter sound association, and sight word recognition skills. Significant differences were found for letter sound association, sight word recognition, and locomotor movement skill development between groups ( p < .05). A significant group*gender interaction was also reported for sight word recognition (p < .05). The findings of this study support the use of combined reading and physical education instruction with kindergarten students.

A pre-/post-test design with an intervention group and a control group was used. A sample of 40, 4- to 6-year-old pre-school children was selected and allocated to the two groups. The intervention group participated in a perceptual-motor programme while the control group received no intervention. The programme involved an hour session once per week, over a period of seven months and consisted of different activities to improve body awareness, gross and fine motor skills, coordination, balance, bilateral integration, locomotor skills and spatial awareness. Both groups were evaluated with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2) and the Junior South African Individual Scale (JSAIS). Co-variance of analysis adjusted for pre-test differences showed that the programme contributed significantly to improvement in the fine motor, gross motor and total motor quotients, while two of the subscales of the JSAIS also showed significant improvement. The Kinderkinetics programme was effective in the improvement of perceptual-motor abilities of these pre-school children, while also contributing to their school readiness on an attentive and cognitive level.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pienaar Anita Elizabeth; Van Rensburg Esme ; Smit Adel ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.10520/EJC108959","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pienaar Anita Elizabeth, Van Rensburg Esme, and Smit Adel (2011) Effect of a Kinderkinetics programme on components of children's perceptual-motor and cognitive functioning.

suggests that acting mindfully, that is, by stressing the purpose of the action and monitoring its current state, may benefit health, wellbeing, and academic achievements. We sought to investigate the underlying motor abilities affected by mindful-movement (MM) intervention, and which mediate its effect on academic achievement among kindergarteners. To this end, 160 children aged 3–6 years participated for 145 days, which included pre- and post-intervention tests of verbal and non-verbal intelligence, namely language, mathematics, and Raven matrices. The three conditions consisted of MM (integrating movement in academic learning), MS (movement-for-its-own-sake; promoting movement without promoting awareness), and control (regular academic environment activities). Results indicated that, compared to MS and controls, MM improved verbal and non-verbal intelligence. The effect on verbal intelligence was mediated through static balance performance, whereas the effect on non-verbal intelligence was mediated by dynamic balance performance. Possible mechanisms accounting for these mediation effects are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: Please code for MM vs control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rosenstreich Eyal ; Shoval Ela ; Sharir Tal ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/S10643-020-01150-5","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rosenstreich Eyal, Shoval Ela, and Sharir Tal (2021) The effects of mindful movement intervention on academic and cognitive abilities among kindergarten children.

In addition to physical health, daily physical activity’s benefits on the brain and cognitive functioning have been extensively researched and provide support for incorporating more physical activity into physical education and the school day. This research investigated the effects of physical activity on academic achievement in kindergarten children across the 2008/09 school year. The main hypothesis examined in the study was whether children who participated in the Interactive Physical Activity Center (IPAC) would perform better academically than the control group on the Dibels Oral Reading Fluency, Retell Fluency, and Group Mathematics Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation (G-Made) achievement tests. To ensure that children in the experimental group were physically active, participation, changes in heart rate, activity scores and perceived exertion were examined across the year. Third, school attendance was examined to determine if the experimental group had fewer school absences than the control group. A longitudinal non-equivalent control group design was used to investigate the relationship between physical activity and academic achievement. To determine if the children were active in the IPAC, a one-way ANOVA examined changes in fitness variables. For the main question of the study concerning physical activity and academic achievement a two-way (Group X Time) ANOVA was used to compare academic progress of the experimental and control group. To assess school attendance of the two groups, a one-tailed independent samples t-test was used. Results demonstrated that kindergarten children who received the IPAC program increased their physical activity and reached the academic performance level of the control group by the end of the school year. The experimental group experienced a greater rate of improvement over time in three out of four of the Dibels subtests compared to the control group, and improved the same as the controls in the Growth Scale Value of the G-Made. These results expand previous research on the relationship between physical activity and academic performance in kindergarten children. Results of this study are important for administrators and teachers because quality physical activity experiences have the potential to impact cognitive, physical and academic outcomes in our schools.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code LNF as primary outcome.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Shannonhouse Amy Kathleen; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shannonhouse Amy Kathleen (2012) The effects of physical activity on academic achievement in kindergarten aged children. , University of Pittsburgh ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":11640334,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907352,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"(1) an experimental group with intervention—orienteering; (2) an experimental group with intervention—dance,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Zach etal_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215240,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907352,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"(1) an experimental group with intervention—orienteering; (2) an experimental group with intervention—dance,\nand (3) a control group with no intervention.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Zach etal_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215249,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215255,"AdditionalText":"Taught by registered/professional trainers and in their typical classes.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907352,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Additionally, it should be noted that we had pre-existing groups, since every classroom\nas a whole was assigned to a group.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Zach etal_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907352,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Group 1, orienteering, included nine weekly orienteering activities that gradually increased in level of difﬁculty, starting\nin the classroom; see details in Table 1.

The dance group went through the process of\npre-tests, intervention dance, and post-tests.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Zach etal_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8302423,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"Outcomes":[{"OutcomeId":87799,"ItemSetId":99908796,"OutcomeTypeId":5,"OutcomeTypeName":"Continuous","ItemAttributeIdIntervention":5407027,"ItemAttributeIdControl":5407003,"ItemAttributeIdOutcome":5407091,"Title":"CMB - Spatial Perception - General score","ItemTimepointId":0,"ItemTimepointMetric":"","ItemTimepointValue":"","TimepointDisplayValue":" ","ItemArmIdGrp1":0,"ItemArmIdGrp2":0,"grp1ArmName":"","grp2ArmName":"","ShortTitle":"Zach (2015)","OutcomeDescription":"The RP (Reproduction of Patterns) sub-test is based on the simple visual-motor task of copying three-dimensional patterns.

A pre–post intervention trials design with intervention and control groups was implemented. Participants were 123 kindergarten children, divided into three groups: experimental—orienteering, experimental—dance, and control—no intervention. Instrumentations: attention measured by the MOXO-CPT, a computerized test, and The Cognitive Modifiability Battery Reproduction of Patterns measured spatial abilities. Measurements were conducted pre- and post-interventions. Results showed fast improvement from pre- to post-intervention, achieved simultaneously in both EFs for the experimental groups only. No differences were found between boys and girls. It was concluded that in order to successfully achieve the required tasks, an integration of physical and cognitive skills is needed.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code for spatial perception as primary outcome and attentional performance as a secondary outcome.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zach Sima ; Inglis Varda ; Fox Orly ; Berger Itay ; Stahl Ayelet ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2015.08.003","Keywords":"Attention\r\nBatteries\r\nDance\r\nDancing\r\nEarly childhood\r\nExecutive functions\r\nExercise\r\nJewish schools\r\nOrienteering\r\nPhysical fitness\r\nPhysical instruments\r\nSpatial perception","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zach Sima, Inglis Varda, Fox Orly, Berger Itay, and Stahl Ayelet (2015) The effect of physical activity on spatial perception and attention in early childhood.
