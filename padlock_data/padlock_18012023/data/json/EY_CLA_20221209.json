Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\r\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools). Peers will normally be of similar age and socio-economic or cultural background.\r\rUniversity students tutoring primary school pupils would not usually be classified as 'peers'.","AttributeType":"Not

Each child was tested before and after a 6-week training period with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), a Sentence Imitation Test (SIT), and a Picture Interview (PI). Vocabulary training involved practice in recognizing and applying words from the PPVT and the PI. Sentence training consisted of imitating sentences similar to those in the SIT and constructing new instances of the same sentence types. Analyses of variance showed that vocabulary training had a positive effect on recognition and production of the words taught (p < .025), but did not transfer to sentence imitation. There were no significant effects of sentence training. Vocabulary seems more amenable to early training with disadvantaged children.","Comments":"3 arms: Please code vocabulary training group as treatment group and control as the comparison (for oral language).

Seventy-one preschoolers aged 3-5 from a low SES township in central Israel (35 in the reading program and 36 in the writing program) participated in evaluation of the interventions. Twenty-four untreated preschoolers served as a control group. The children were tested twice, at the beginning and at the end of the school year, in: phonological awareness, word writing, letter knowledge, orthographic awareness, listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, and general knowledge. Both programs involved games and creative activities. The writing program encouraged letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and functional writing activities. The reading program utilized 11 children's books for focusing on language and exploring major concepts raised by these books. Results indicated that children in the two literacy programs progressed significantly more than the control group on phonological awareness and orthographic awareness. However, the joint writing group significantly outperformed both the joint reading group and the control group on phonological awareness, word writing, orthographic awareness, and letter knowledge. We also found that children as young as 3-4 years gained from literacy programs as much as did older children, aged 4-5, on all the measures assessed in our program.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: please code \"language and story book reading\" as treatment condition","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aram D ; Biron S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2004.10.003","Keywords":"Foreign Countries\r\nOlder Adults\r\nPhonological Awareness\r\nCreative Activities\r\nReading Programs\r\nReading\r\nReading Skills\r\nListening Comprehension\r\nEmergent Literacy\r\nControl Groups","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aram D, and Biron S (2004) Joint storybook reading and joint writing interventions among low SES preschoolers: Differential contributions to early literacy.

It was expected that storybook reading would enhance primarily vocabulary while alphabetic skills training would promote primarily alphabetic skills. Program by age interactions were examined in two age groups (3–4 and 4–5 years old) to test whether the storybook reading program may be more productive for the younger children whereas alphabetic skills program more productive for the older children. Twelve low-SES preschools participated in the study, three in each program and three as a comparison group. Results indicated that the children in the three intervention programs progressed significantly more than the comparison group on name writing, letter knowledge and phonological awareness . Further, the alphabetic skills program outperformed the other groups on word writing, letter knowledge and initial letter retrieval , whereas the storybook reading program outperformed only the comparison group. Results on the combined program were mixed – enhancing more initial letter retrieval and book vocabulary than storybook reading program. In general, no differences emerged in the progress of younger versus older children except on receptive vocabulary – the younger surpassing the older in all programs.","Comments":"3 arms: please code \"story book reading program\" as treatment condition and \"alphabetic skills program\" as control","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aram Dorit ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11145-006-9005-2","Keywords":"Literacy Programs -- Analysis\r\nLiteracy -- Analysis\r\nChildren's Books -- Analysis","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aram Dorit (2006) Early literacy interventions: The relative roles of storybook reading, alphabetic activities, and their combination.

The vocabulary instruction occurred after a story had been read, discussed, and con- cluded. Instruction took place after reading because the goal for teaching the words was to enhance general vocabulary develop- ment rather than comprehension of the story at hand.

The words feast, exhausted, and cautiously were selected from the story. The following explains the way feast was taught. The words in quotations are from the script that teachers received for the in- struction and illustrate how the information was provided to students. • First, the word was contextualized for its role in the story: “In the story, it said that the animals found the robbers’ ta- ble full of good things to eat, and so they had a feast.” • Next, the meaning of the word was ex- plained: “A feast is a big special meal with lots of delicious food.” • The children were asked to repeat the word so that they could create a pho- nological representation of it: “Say the word with me: feast.” • Examples in contexts other than the one used in the story were provided: “People usually have a feast on a hol- iday or to celebrate something special. We all have a feast on Thanksgiving Day.” • Children made judgments about ex- amples: “Which would be a feast: eat- ing an ice cream cone or eating at a big table full of all kinds of food? Why?” • Children were asked to construct their own examples: “If you wanted to eat a feast, what kinds of food would you want?” • The word’s phonological and mean- ing representations were reinforced: “What’s the word that means a big special meal?”\"\n\"In addition to introducing words in the manner shown above, teachers were asked to reinforce the words on subsequent days.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Beck & McKeown_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":356008,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"For example, all teachers kept charts of the words from several stories posted on the wall.

Study 1 compared the number of sophisticated words learned between 52 children who were directly taught the words and 46 children who received no instruction. As expected, children in the experimental group learned significantly more words. Study 2, a within‐subject design, examined 76 children’s learning of words under 2 different amounts of instruction, either 3 days or 6 days. In Study 2, the vocabulary gains in kindergarten and first‐grade children for words that received more instruction were twice as large. Student vocabulary was assessed by a picture test where students were presented with pictures that represented different words and were asked to identify which picture represented the word that the tester provided. The verbal test was similar but used a sentence description of a scenario instead of a picture. The instructional implications for which words to teach and how to teach them to young children are discussed.","Comments":"It contains 2 studies.\rPlease code only study one.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beck Isabel L ; McKeown Margaret G ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1086/511706","Keywords":"Social sciences -- Population studies -- Human populations\r\nEducation -- Formal education -- Pedagogy\r\nLinguistics -- Applied linguistics -- Psycholinguistics\r\nLinguistics -- Language -- Lexicology\r\nArts -- Literature -- Literary genres\r\nApplied sciences -- Research methods -- Observational research\r\nBiological sciences -- Biology -- Physiology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beck Isabel L, and McKeown Margaret G (2007) Increasing young low‐income children’s oral vocabulary repertoires through rich and focused instruction.

These oral and written language experiences encourage the development of strategies and behaviors that encourage and facilitate the child’s later reading ability. While much attention has been given to the development of vocabulary and phonological awareness knowledge in the young learner, less has been paid to the growth of comprehension skills, particularly in the area of non-fiction, or expository, text. This study investigates the impact of comprehension instruction on disadvantaged preschool children’s understanding of expository children’s books. Forty-five children enrolled in year round Head Start services in Central Pennsylvania were split into ten small groups and read ten non-fiction books over a six week period. Approximately half of the children were taught to summarize content and identify topic during shared book reading sessions, while the remaining children were read the books without explicit instruction. Results indicate that children as young as three can be taught to identify the topic in a novel expository text. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are also discussed.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Program implementation should be based on valid research pertaining to the efficacy of the approach being used. Concern for the learner's nature and needs should be an essential criterion to be applied in selecting particular instructional materials and procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two methods of introducing reading skills to kindergarteners. A total of 87 subjects participated in the investigation. One group of 42 subjects was designated as the control group, and one group of 45 subjects was designated as the experimental group. Both groups were administered the Developmental Indicator for the Assessment of Learning-R to determine if there was a significant difference between the two groups at the.05 level when the investigation commenced. Statistical analysis using the t-test for independent means yielded no significant difference between the groups. The control and experimental groups received reading readiness instruction via two different approaches. The control group received reading instruction via a basal reader readiness program (Houghton Mifflin), and the experimental group received reading instruction via an eclectic, integrated, approach (Success). The instructional period lasted for a period of 140 days. The performance of the two groups on the California Achievement Test, Form E, was analyzed using a t-test for independent means and an a priori alpha risk of.05 to test the six null hypotheses. There were significant differences on the following subtests performance favoring the experimental (Success) group: Reading Comprehension, Reading Vocabulary, Reading Total, and Language Expression. There were no significant differences between the performance of the two groups on the subtests of Sound Recognition and Visual Recognition. The results of the investigation reveal that the Success approach, which is an integrated, eclectic approach, is an effective method for teaching beginning reading skills to kindergarteners. Although effective with the experimental subjects of the investigation, it would be beneficial to know the effects of the program and program components on other subjects at other grade levels and from different groups.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Because there is a strong relationship between language development during the early years and reading ability in the primary grades, early childhood teachers must understand language and literacy development. Children enter kindergarten in the United States with large differences in their background knowledge, vocabulary, and early literacy experiences. It is essential that early childhood programs provide quality language experiences such as read-alouds in order for children to become successful readers. This study examined the strategy of using nonfiction interactive book read-alouds with the emergent reader in preschool to promote vocabulary development. In this quantitative study, 53 three-, four-, and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program were participants. The preschool children were assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT) as pre and posttests. The researcher read nonfiction literature to one class and fictional text to another twice per week for 12 weeks but did not read to the control group. Standardized test scores did not show significant differences in the post-test scores among the control and the two treatment groups, although all groups showed improvement in their receptive and expressive vocabularies. In addition, a survey designed by the researcher was sent out to preschool teachers and childcare providers about the amount of time they read aloud to children, the amount of time they spend reading fiction compared to nonfiction text, and their years of teaching in early childhood and educational backgrounds. Results showed that teachers in early childhood programs are reading to children an average of 8.5 out of 10 days, although nonfiction literature is not being read to young children as much as fiction. The findings in this report have implications for practice in the field. Because vocabulary development is a key ingredient in the learning-to-read process, teachers and parents can use nonfiction as a tool, if they are aware of the benefits of how to use this genre to support children's emerging literacy skills.","Comments":"3 arms: please code both treatments as primary outcomes","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Bortnem Gayle ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Preschool Education\r\nEducation\r\nExpressive Vocabulary\r\nInteractive\r\nNonfiction\r\nPreschool Children\r\nRead-Alouds\r\nReceptive Vocabulary","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bortnem Gayle (2005) The effects of using non-fiction interactive read -alouds on expressive and receptive vocabulary of preschool children. , University of South Dakota."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":11237538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"142","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907309,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Attrition\nrates differed between groups; 9 children were lost from\nthe P + R group compared to 1 child from the OL group.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bowyer‐Crane etal_2008.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215251,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907309,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"d randomly allocated to either\nthe P + R programme or the OL programme[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bowyer‐Crane etal_2008.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":907309,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"The 8 children in each school were randomly allocated\nwithout restriction to the P + R or OL Intervention[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bowyer‐Crane etal_2008.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215518,"AdditionalText":"5","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907309,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"f daily inter-\nvention[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bowyer‐Crane etal_2008.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215517,"AdditionalText":"20","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215512,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907309,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"n alternating between small group and individual sessions[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bowyer‐Crane etal_2008.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":907309,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\".

This study compares the efficacy of two school-based intervention programmes (Phonology with Reading (P + R) and Oral Language (OL)) for children with poor oral language at school entry. Methods: Following screening of 960 children, 152 children (mean age 4;09) were selected from 19 schools on the basis of poor vocabulary and verbal reasoning skills and randomly allocated to either the P + R programme or the OL programme. Both groups of children received 20 weeks of daily intervention alternating between small group and individual sessions, delivered by trained teaching assistants. Children in the P + R group received training in letter-sound knowledge, phonological awareness and book level reading skills. Children in the OL group received instruction in vocabulary, comprehension, inference generation and narrative skills. The children's progress was monitored at four time points: pre-, mid- and post-intervention, and after a 5-month delay, using measures of literacy, language and phonological awareness. Results: The data are clustered (children within schools) and robust confidence intervals are reported. At the end of the 20-week intervention programme, children in the P + R group showed an advantage over the OL group on literacy and phonological measures, while children in the OL group showed an advantage over the P + R group on measures of vocabulary and grammatical skills. These gains were maintained over a 5-month period. Conclusions: Intervention programmes designed to develop oral language skills can be delivered successfully by trained teaching assistants to children at school entry. Training using P + R fostered decoding ability whereas the OL programme improved vocabulary and grammatical skills that are foundations for reading comprehension. However, at the end of the intervention, more than 50% of at-risk children remain in need of literacy support.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bowyer‐Crane C ; Snowling M J; Duff F J; Fieldsend E ; Carroll J M; Miles J ; Götz K ; Hulme C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01849.x","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bowyer‐Crane C, Snowling M J, Duff F J, Fieldsend E, Carroll J M, Miles J, Götz K, and Hulme C (2008) Improving early language and literacy skills: Differential effects of an oral language versus a phonology with reading intervention.

knowledge of 24 target vocabulary words that were presented in the storybooks for the first experimental group. The classroom teachers who implemented the lessons administered the tests to each participant. The test was administered during the conclusion of the four-week research period. The test consisted of 24 forced-choice items and the administration time ranged between 3-5 minutes. Each question was read orally to the students and two possible answer choices were provided. The examiner read the testing prompt followed by the 24 test items: “We will play a question and answer game. I will ask you a question and you will give me an answer. I will give you two answer choices. If you do not know the answer, you may say, I do not know. Question: Which would be unattractive? Answer choices: Getting a shot from the doctor? or Going shopping at the toy store?” The vocabulary posttest measure used in this study is located in Appendix C.\r","Data1":28,"Data2":21,"Data3":18.03,"Data4":15.76,"Data5":2.91,"Data6":3.05,"Data7":0,"Data8":0,"Data9":0,"Data10":0,"Data11":0,"Data12":0,"Data13":0,"Data14":0,"InterventionText":"Literacy: speaking and listening/oral language","ControlText":"With active control","OutcomeText":"Primary outcome","feWeight":0,"reWeight":0,"SMD":0.7519516246449534,"SESMD":0.2993451805627122,"R":0,"SER":0,"OddsRatio":0,"SEOddsRatio":0,"RiskRatio":0,"SERiskRatio":0,"CIUpperSMD":1.3386681785478691,"CILowerSMD":0.16523507074203747,"CIUpperR":0,"CILowerR":0,"CIUpperOddsRatio":0,"CILowerOddsRatio":0,"CIUpperRiskRatio":0,"CILowerRiskRatio":0,"CIUpperRiskDifference":0,"CILowerRiskDifference":0,"CIUpperPetoOddsRatio":0,"CILowerPetoOddsRatio":0,"CIUpperMeanDifference":3.962205854301816,"CILowerMeanDifference":0.577794145698187,"RiskDifference":0,"SERiskDifference":0,"MeanDifference":2.2700000000000014,"SEMeanDifference":0.8633703338274563,"PetoOR":0,"SEPetoOR":0,"ES":0.7519516246449534,"SEES":0.2993451805627122,"NRows":3,"CILower":0.16523507074203747,"CIUpper":1.3386681785478691,"ESDesc":"SMD","SEDesc":"SE","Data1Desc":"Group 1 N","Data2Desc":"Group 2 N","Data3Desc":"Group 1 mean","Data4Desc":"Group 2 mean","Data5Desc":"Group 1 SD","Data6Desc":"Group 2 SD","Data7Desc":"","Data8Desc":"","Data9Desc":"","Data10Desc":"","Data11Desc":"","Data12Desc":"","Data13Desc":"","Data14Desc":"","OutcomeCodes":{"OutcomeItemAttributesList":[{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407009,"AttributeName":"Sample: All","OutcomeId":49679,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304620},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407010,"AttributeName":"Post-test unadjusted (select one from this group)","OutcomeId":49679,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304621},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407029,"AttributeName":"Test type: Researcher developed test","OutcomeId":49679,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304622},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407059,"AttributeName":"Toolkit: Oral language interventions","OutcomeId":49679,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304623},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":7755570,"AttributeName":"Toolkit primary outcome","OutcomeId":49679,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304624},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":7755575,"AttributeName":"Other outcome","OutcomeId":49679,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304625},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":11183748,"AttributeName":"EY_Toolkit: Communication and language approaches","OutcomeId":49679,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304626}]}}],"ItemId":38111478,"Title":"Becoming acquainted with the faces of words: Fostering vocabulary development in kindergarten students through storybook readings","ParentTitle":"","ShortTitle":"Brooks (2006)","DateCreated":"28/10/2018","CreatedBy":"","DateEdited":"13/03/2021","EditedBy":"Jade Stafford","Year":"2006","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"Auburn, AL","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"Auburn University","Volume":"","Pages":"","Edition":"","Issue":"","Availability":"","URL":"https://search.proquest.com/docview/85688889","OldItemId":"2198","Abstract":"The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of storybook readings with explicit instruction of target words on the vocabulary acquisition of primary grade students. The secondary focus of the research sought to investigate vocabulary learning through storybook readings as it relates to students' entering vocabulary knowledge. The study involved 78 kindergarten students who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Storybook reading with explicit instruction of target words, storybook reading without explicit instruction of target words, and a control group. The Peabody-Picture Vocabulary Test-III was used to assess receptive vocabulary knowledge. Data analysis indicated that there was a statistical difference between students who received storybook readings with explicit instruction and students who were not exposed to storybook readings. A trend was noted between the explicit storybook group with explicit instruction, which had higher mean scores, and the storybook reading only group. However, statistically significant differences were not indicated. Students with higher initial vocabularies made greater vocabulary knowledge gains on the vocabulary posttest measure suggesting a \"rich-get richer effect\" pertaining to vocabulary acquisition.","Comments":"3 arms: please code \"storybook reading with explicit instruction of target words\" condition as treatment group.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Brooks Resia ;

Two groups of 22 students each were matched for sex and for scores on standardized reading readiness tests administered at the end of the kindergarten year. Students in the experimental group had participated in the Language Experience program while students in the control group had participated in the traditional readiness class. Students from both groups were randomly placed into first grade levels and received reading instruction through a basal reading program. The Gates-MacGintie Test, Primary Form A, was administered to all students at the end of first grade. Scores from the comprehension and vocabulary sections of the test were used to compare the reading progress of the experimental and control groups. Results indicated significantly higher scores on both subtests for the students who were exposed to the Language Experience program.

Two schools participated in the SWELL program in the kindergarten year. The other two schools pursued the regular kindergarten curriculum. Pre- and post-tests were made on a sample of kindergarten students in all four schools (between-school evaluation). Post-tests only were performed on a sample of Year 1 students who had not been exposed to SWELL (within-schools evaluation). End-of-year assessments indicated that experimental students outperformed control students on words read in context, but not on words read in isolation (between-schools evaluation). A similar but non-significant trend was observed between kindergarten and Year 1 students in the experimental schools, but was not evident for control schools (within-schools evaluation).

The parent prompts the child to say something about the storybook, evaluates the childs response, expands the childs responses by rephrasing and adding information, and repeats the prompt to ensure the child has learned from the expansion.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Chow _ McBridge-Chang_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414587,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" raising global literacy standards and educational achievement.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Chow _ McBridge-Chang_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215518,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414587,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"Parents were encouraged to read each book twice in a week for 15 minutes each time with their children.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Chow _ McBridge-Chang_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215519,"AdditionalText":"15","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414587,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\" Parents were encouraged to read each book twice in a week for 15 minutes each time with their children.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Chow _ McBridge-Chang_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215644,"AdditionalText":"Numbers not given.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414587,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 14:\n[¬s]\" the sex ratio and the pretest scores were not fully balanced across groups, though there were no significant differences found.

After an 8- week intervention, the children were posttested. Results indicated a significant main group effect for performance on both the PPCLS and the PPVT-III, with children in the dialogic reading group benefiting significantly from the intervention. These results indicate that early literacy-related activities in the home have strong and direct effects on both children's literacy growth and language development in Chinese.

It also ascertained teachers' perceptions of the program. A mixed methods approach was used to answer the following research questions: 1. Is there a significant difference between the vocabulary scores of four [1] year-old children who received oral language instruction through a conversational classroom program and those who did not, as measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition? 2. What are the perceptions of teachers regarding the program, immediately after they receive training in its use, and after they implement it for twelve weeks with their students, as ascertained by questionnaires and interviews? The study was conducted in two private preschools in a suburb of a large southwestern city. There were 37 four year olds in three control classes in one school, and 42 four year olds in three experimental classes in other school. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Tests, Form A and Form B, were used as pretest and posttest for both groups. Before beginning the twelve-week treatment, the teachers of the experimental classes were trained in using conversation as a tool development of four year olds. These teachers provided questionnaire data and interview data immediately after the training sessions and again after the twelve [1] week implementation of the program in their classrooms, In answer to the first research question, the statistical analysis of the data showed that there was a significant difference between the vocabulary scores of four year olds who received oral language instruction through the conversational classroom program and those who did not, as measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The posttest scores of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group. In answer to the second research question, the teachers' perceptions of the conversational program were primarily positive, as ascertained from interviews and questionnaires. They felt that they benefited from the training and that their students' vocabularies benefited from the implementation of the program.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Correll K ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Correll K (2008) A program evaluation of a conversational instruction program for the vocabulary development of four-year-old students in preschool classes. , University of Houston."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":358949,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" storybook intervention[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Coyne etal_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":358949,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"The intervention consisted of 108 half-hour lessons developed to accompany 40 chil- drens storybooks.

selected vocabulary from the stories used in storybook intervention. The National Reading Panel (2000) concluded that specific vocabulary growth is best assessed through researcher- developed measures because these measures are more sensitive to gains achieved through instruction than are standardized tools. To assess specific vocabulary growth, we developed a 20-word instrument in which students were asked to produce word meanings or tell anything they knew about target words. Ten specific words were randomly selected from the pool of explicitly taught vocabulary, and the remaining 10 words were randomly selected from the pool of words that appeared in the stories but received no explicit instructional emphasis. No more than one word per story occurred in the measure. The measure was individually administered at pre- and postintervention in two separate sessions of 10 words each. Each assessment item consisted of two questions: (a) asking the definition of the word (e.g., “What is a principal?” “What does roared mean?”), and (b) asking a what, when, or how question (e.g., “What does a principal do?” “What do you do when you roar?”). To guide scoring, definitions for each word were specified, including dictionary definitions, synonyms, and the informal definition used during storybook instruction. A panel of four scorers further determined the criteria, awarding points to responses that did not match the listed definitions or synonyms. Student responses were scored on a scale of 0 to 3 points per word. A score of 3 was awarded to responses matching the listed definitions or synonyms; responses that had no relation to the listed definitions received 0 points. A separate total score was calculated for each student for taught words and untaught words. Total possible scores on each of the assessments ranged from 0 to 30 points.

Results indicated that in comparison to students in the control group, students in the intervention with lower receptive vocabulary skills demonstrated greater gains in explicitly taught vocabulary than did students with higher receptive vocabulary.

We selected a sample of 37 of the 54 target words to include on this measure to reduce the length of administration. We sampled words that were representative of all word types and that were introduced throughout the 18-week intervention. Students were first asked to provide a definition of a target word (e.g., “Tell me what the word halt means.”). Next, students were asked a question in which the target word was used in a relatively neutral context (e.g., “What would you be doing if you were halting?”). Each question was scored with 2 points for a complete response (e.g., “Halt means to stop”), 1 point for a partial or related response (e.g., “Halt is like a statue”), and zero points for an unrelated response, or no response. The maximum score a student could receive for each word was 4 (i.e., 2 points possible for each question). The internal consistency reliability for this measure was .98. We administered the definition question for each word at pretest to document any prior knowledge of target words and to examine comparability across treatment and control groups. We administered the both questions at posttest to evaluate impact of the intervention on target word knowledge.","Data1":1.71,"Data2":0.21,"Data3":0,"Data4":0,"Data5":0,"Data6":0,"Data7":0,"Data8":0,"Data9":0,"Data10":0,"Data11":0,"Data12":0,"Data13":0,"Data14":0,"InterventionText":"Literacy: speaking and listening/oral language","ControlText":"","OutcomeText":"Secondary outcome(s)","feWeight":0,"reWeight":0,"SMD":1.71,"SESMD":0.21,"R":0,"SER":0,"OddsRatio":0,"SEOddsRatio":0,"RiskRatio":0,"SERiskRatio":0,"CIUpperSMD":2.1216,"CILowerSMD":1.2984,"CIUpperR":0,"CILowerR":0,"CIUpperOddsRatio":0,"CILowerOddsRatio":0,"CIUpperRiskRatio":0,"CILowerRiskRatio":0,"CIUpperRiskDifference":0,"CILowerRiskDifference":0,"CIUpperPetoOddsRatio":0,"CILowerPetoOddsRatio":0,"CIUpperMeanDifference":0,"CILowerMeanDifference":0,"RiskDifference":0,"SERiskDifference":0,"MeanDifference":0,"SEMeanDifference":0,"PetoOR":0,"SEPetoOR":0,"ES":1.71,"SEES":0.21,"NRows":6,"CILower":1.2984,"CIUpper":2.1216,"ESDesc":"Effect size","SEDesc":"SE","Data1Desc":"SMD","Data2Desc":"standard error","Data3Desc":"r","Data4Desc":"SE (Z transformed)","Data5Desc":"odds ratio","Data6Desc":"SE (log OR)","Data7Desc":"risk ratio","Data8Desc":"SE (log RR)","Data9Desc":"","Data10Desc":"","Data11Desc":"risk difference","Data12Desc":"standard error","Data13Desc":"mean difference","Data14Desc":"standard error","OutcomeCodes":{"OutcomeItemAttributesList":[{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407009,"AttributeName":"Sample: All","OutcomeId":49420,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":209666},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407010,"AttributeName":"Post-test unadjusted (select one from this group)","OutcomeId":49420,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":209667},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407028,"AttributeName":"Test type: Standardised test ","OutcomeId":49420,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":209668},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407059,"AttributeName":"Toolkit: Oral language interventions","OutcomeId":49420,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":209669},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":7755575,"AttributeName":"Other outcome","OutcomeId":49420,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":209670}]}},{"OutcomeId":49421,"ItemSetId":48491217,"OutcomeTypeId":0,"OutcomeTypeName":"Continuous","ItemAttributeIdIntervention":5407016,"ItemAttributeIdControl":0,"ItemAttributeIdOutcome":5407093,"Title":"Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test(PPVT)-direct and extended vocabulary instruction","ItemTimepointId":0,"ItemTimepointMetric":"","ItemTimepointValue":"","TimepointDisplayValue":" ","ItemArmIdGrp1":0,"ItemArmIdGrp2":0,"grp1ArmName":"","grp2ArmName":"","ShortTitle":"Coyne (2007)","OutcomeDescription":"We used the PPVT–III (Dunn & Dunn, 1997) to assess students’ generalized vocabulary knowledge.

In the SNAP, students listen to a story read aloud while following along with pictures in a wordless storybook. We adapted the SNAP by incorporating 18 of our target words into the story, which had 395 total words. We selected target words that were representative of the words taught throughout the intervention and could be integrated in the story. Each of the words that were incorporated into the SNAP was also assessed as part of the target word measure. Following the reading, students were asked 10 questions about the story that were both literal and inferential. We adapted 5 of the questions so that they included a target word in the question (e.g., What happened when Joe grasped at the frog?) Answers to questions were scored as either correct or incorrect.

A second purpose was to examine whether treatment effects would be moderated by initial receptive vocabulary knowledge measured at pretest. In a quasi-experimental design, 80 kindergarten students from schools serving large at-risk populations were taught the meanings of 54 vocabulary words within interactive story read alouds over 36 half-hour instructional lessons (2 lessons per week over 18 weeks).An additional 44 students served as a no-treatment control. Findings indicated that students who received vocabulary instruction outperformed controls on a measure of target word knowledge as well as measures of generalized receptive vocabulary and listening comprehension. In addition, initial receptive vocabulary was strongly related to posttest performance on all measures. Implications are discussed in relation to supporting vocabulary development in the early grades within a multitier framework of instruction and intervention. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coyne M D; McCoach D Betsy; Loftus S ; Zipoli Jr R; Ruby M ; Crevecoeur Y C; Kapp S ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19345741003592410","Keywords":"Published version from: Coyne,M., Zipoli, R., Jr., Loftus, S.,& Kapp, S.

Extended vocabulary instruction is characterized by explicit teaching that includes both contextual and definitional information, multiple exposures to target words in varied contexts, and experiences that promote deep processing of word meanings. In Study One, we compared extended instruction of target words to incidental exposure. In Study Two, we compared extended instruction to embedded instruction (i.e., providing simple definitions within the context of the story). Our findings indicated that extended instruction resulted in greater word learning than either incidental exposure or embedded instruction. Moreover, students maintained much of their understanding of word meanings six to eight weeks after instruction. Implications are discussed in relation to a tri-level approach to vocabulary instruction and intervention for kindergarten students at risk for language and reading disabilities.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Extended vocabulary instruction is characterized by explicit teaching that includes both contextual and definitional information, multiple exposures to target words in varied contexts, and experiences that promote deep processing of word meanings. In Study One, we compared extended instruction of target words to incidental exposure. In Study Two, we compared extended instruction to embedded instruction (i.e., providing simple definitions within the context of the story). Our findings indicated that extended instruction resulted in greater word learning than either incidental exposure or embedded instruction. Moreover, students maintained much of their understanding of word meanings six to eight weeks after instruction. Implications are discussed in relation to a tri-level approach to vocabulary instruction and intervention for kindergarten students at risk for language and reading disabilities.","Comments":"MDE: Please code study 2.\rESDE: Please combine means and SDs for 3 outcomes and enter as single overall outcome (vocabulary) - post-test only.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Coyne Michael D; McCoach D Betsy; Kapp Sharon ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2307/30035543","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\nEducation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Coyne Michael D, McCoach D Betsy, and Kapp Sharon (2007) Vocabulary intervention for kindergarten students: Comparing extended instruction to embedded instruction and incidental exposure.

We compared the effects of this instruction on adult and child language during shared book reading and on children’s vocabulary growth in three different treatment conditions. Thirty two children with language delays were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) parent instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (b) staff instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (c) staff instruction without one-on-one shared book reading practice (control group). Children were given standardized tests of vocabulary and were videotaped during shared book reading before and after the 8-week intervention period. Parents and staff showed changes in their shared book reading style consistent with the instruction they had received. After adult instruction in Dialogic Reading, children in all three groups spoke more, made longer utterances, produced more different words, and participated more in shared book reading. The magnitude of change in the children’s linguistic performance from pre- to posttest was positively correlated with the magnitude of change in adult behavior. There were no statistically significant changes in children’s vocabulary test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with a Vygotskian model in which children’s linguistic performance can be enhanced by a supportive social context.","Comments":"3 arms: please code \"dialogic reading with staff\" as treatment condition and \"dialogic reading without reading practice\" as control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Crain-Thoreson Catherine ; Dale Philip S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/027112149901900103","Keywords":"Developmental Delays\r\nEarly Childhood Education\r\nInterpersonal Communication\r\nLanguage Acquisition\r\nReading Aloud To Others\r\nSpeech Communication\r\nVocabulary Development\r\nYoung Children","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Crain-Thoreson Catherine, and Dale Philip S (1999) Enhancing linguistic performance: Parents and teachers as book reading partners for children with language delays.

Participants included 122 kindergarteners from three elementary schools within three separate school districts in the northeastern United States who were assigned to either a treatment condition (ELLS, n = 31 EOLs, n = 49) or no-treatment condition (ELLs, n = 17 EOLs, n = 25). Interventionists were trained to deliver direct vocabulary instruction using one of 18 storybooks twice per week in 20-25 minute sessions. The research design of the study employed a pretest, posttest, quasi- experimental group design. Analyses consisted of two-by-two analyses of variance (2 x 2 ANOVAs), with two between-subjects factors (instructional condition x language status), and t-tests to examine the effects of vocabulary intervention on the word learning of ELLs and EOLs, and hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) to investigate word learning differences between ELLs and EOLs using pretest PPVT-III to predict posttest target-word and general, receptive vocabulary knowledge. Participants' knowledge of vocabulary was individually assessed with a researcher-developed measure of target-word knowledge (TWKM) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III (PPVT-III Dunn & Dunn, 1997). Results for 2 x 2 ANOVAs and t-tests indicated that EOLs significantly outperformed ELLs on dependent measures with evidence on an interaction effect on TWKM. HMR results indicated (a) centered pretest PPVT-III accounted for a statistically significant proportion of the variance in posttest measures for participants in the treatment condition and (b) language status did not explain any additional variance in posttest measures above pretest PPVT-III. Each of the two mediation models using the independent variable, language status mediating variable, centered pretest PPVT-III and dependent measures TWKM and PPVT-III resulted in full mediation. Major findings indicated that treatment ELLs and treatment EOLs did equally well on posttest if they had similar initial general, receptive vocabulary knowledge on PPVT-III. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Schools were notified of their allocation on 19 November.\nIn preparation for randomisation, we examined the distribution of schools by region and number of classes in school,\nconcluding that stratification by region and number of classes would be appropriate. Randomisation was therefore\nstratified by (1) geographical location and (2) the number of classes being put forward for intervention by the school.\nThe latter was to ensure that schools with higher numbers of pupils were not allocated to treatment or control unevenly.\nStrata were constructed from regions (geography-based strata, with the thirteen regions described in Table 4) and\nfrom number of classes within a school (one entry school vs. multiple-entry schools). Having uneven numbers of\nschools with one and/or multiple number of classes would mean there is a higher probability that treatment or control\ngroups would be unequal in terms of size.\nTo deal with unequal treatment fractions we used the command randtreat and the option misfits(global)in\nStata (Carril, 2017).

NELI is published by Oxford University Press and was delivered in this trial by the University of Oxford in partnership with Elklan. The 20-week intervention consists of two 15-minute individual sessions and three 30-minute small group sessions each week. The children selected to participate in this trial were the five children in each classroom who obtained the lowest scores on a school-administered app-based assessment of oral language skills (LanguageScreen).The programme focuses on developing children’s narrative, vocabulary, and listening skills, while phonological awareness and letter sound knowledge are also developed during the second half of the programme. Training includes an initial two-day course for TAs followed by a half-day workshop half-way through the programme in addition to ongoing online support. Teachers also receive an initial half-day of training so that they can understand the programme and support TAs. This project was a randomised controlled trial; 193 schools participated, 97 of which received the programme while 96 did not, the latter forming the control group. The process evaluation involved observations of the training, surveys with school staff, case studies in six schools (which used interviews with school staff), and analyses of TA training logs and online resource use. This project was co-funded with the financial support of Intermediate Capital Group (ICG). The trial took place between June 2018 and November 2019.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Dimova S ; Ilie S ; Brown E R; Broeks M ; Culora A ; Sutherland A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dimova S, Ilie S, Brown E R, Broeks M, Culora A, and Sutherland A (2020) The Nuffield Early Language Intervention . : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"Story reading","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215331,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215410,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215435,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215436,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"Kindergarten children who know the oral version of arabic (Aamiyya) are read stories aloud in High Arabic (FusHa) in order to familiarize them with literal language 15-20 minutes at the end of each school day","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":361458,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\" Teach­ ers in the experimental classes were asked to read their students one of the mimeographed stories during the last 15 to 20 minutes of each school day.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Feitelson etal_1993_OCR_Optimized_r.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5372848,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5372849,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215245,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215251,"AdditionalText":"p. 74\r10 kindergartens (n=258) were randomly assigned to the experimental treatment, 2 to control treatment (n=49)\r\rone third of students from each experimental class (n=86, Table 1, page 75, footnote) were randomly selected for testing.\r\r\r\r","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215255,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"135\n\n","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"to familiarize children with FusHa and improve literacy skills","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215494,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":361458,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\" professional obligations of one of the authors to the Ministry of Education[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Feitelson etal_1993_OCR_Optimized_r.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":361458,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Prior to the 5-month-long intervention, separate meetings took place with teachers of the experimental and control classes in order to introduce teachers to the respective aims and methods of each treatment.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Feitelson etal_1993_OCR_Optimized_r.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215513,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215529,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5216719,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5216721,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215576,"AdditionalText":"Growing interest in reading and listening stories","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":361458,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"When the field coordinator visited one of the kin­ dergartens in the final month of the study, a student approached her and said quietly, “Bring us more sto­ ries.

One side effect of young children's lack of familiarity with literacy language is that parents do not read to children from books. The present study investigated whether listening to stories in literary Arabic would have salutary effects on kindergarten children's emergent literacy skills. The 258 children in the experimental treatment listened to teachers' story reading daily for 5 months. Teachers in the control classes (49 children) pursued a Ministry of Education program to enhance expressive language skills. In posttest measures of listening comprehension and picture-storytelling, children in the experimental classess outperformed control classes on comprehension and active use of language. These differences in picture-storytelling were significant at the .01 level for type-token ratio, proportion of clauses, expression of causal connections, and use of story endings. These results demonstrate that children can acquire a second register through exposure in school without the language of their home being stigmatized or abandoned.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

preschoolers from low‐income families participated in a 12‐month intervention programme, funded by Sure Start, which engaged them in scaffolded educational activities delivered at home by their mothers. Immediately following the programme, the intervention group outperformed matched controls in tests of academic knowledge, receptive vocabulary, and inhibitory control, but not short‐term memory or theory of mind. Teachers' ratings of children's capabilities upon school entry favoured the intervention group, especially in terms of listening, responding, writing, mathematics, and personal/social skills. Superior inhibitory control, short‐term memory, and numerical skills were associated with higher ratings whereas theory of mind made a unique, negative contribution to responding. We discuss the implications of these findings for efforts to nurture the development of cognitive self‐regulation and school readiness during early childhood.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ford Ruth M; McDougall Sine J.

Recent federal government mandates, such as Early Reading First (2002) and Reading First (Armbruster, Lehr, & Osborn, 2001) have emphasized the importance of preschool and kindergarten in accelerating future achievement. Nearly all recommendations for improving the quality of preschool and kindergarten experience include reading aloud to children. Indeed, included in the joint statement of the International Reading Association and the National Association for the Education of Young Children is the assertion that \"the single most important activity for building understandings and skills essential for reading success appears to be reading aloud to children\" (1998). This study examined the effect of teachers' read-aloud styles on the listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition of kindergarten students. Combining methods based upon research by Martinez and Teale (1993), Wasik, Bond, and Hindman (2006), Coyne et al. (2004), Lonigan and Whitehurst (1998), Reese & Cox, (1999), and Brabham & Lynch-Brown (2002), two read-aloud styles were formulated. The full model included brief story introductions, teacher comments modeling the process of making inferences during reading, \"rich\" explanations of target vocabulary, open-ended questions focusing upon story events, an after reading summary question, and guided reconstruction. The parsimonious model emphasized vocabulary and questioning with each story combined with a retelling but without the introduction, after reading question, and story reconstruction. A third model, consisting of a teacher reading aloud in his or her traditional style with follow-up activities, served as the control for this research. Three kindergarten classrooms in each of four local elementary schools were recruited to implement each of the read-aloud models (N = 37). Quantitative data analyses indicated significantly higher gains in measures of vocabulary and comprehension, as well as longer and more complete story retellings, for students in classrooms whose teachers employed the full model of reading aloud, as opposed to students in the parsimonious model or control classrooms.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Oral language skills in the preschool and early school years are critical to educational success and provide the foundations for the later development of reading comprehension. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 180 children from 15 UK nursery schools (n = 12 from each setting; M[ age] = 4;0) were randomly allocated to receive a 30-week oral language intervention or to a waiting control group. Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by nursery staff and teaching assistants trained and supported by the research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6-month delay. Results: Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness. Importantly, improvements in oral language skills generalized to a standardized measure of reading comprehension at maintenance test. Conclusions: Early intervention for children with oral language difficulties is effective and can successfully support the skills, which underpin reading comprehension.

The study has two components. The first component is a test of the impacts of one year of the K-PAVE vocabulary instruction in kindergarten, before students have encountered formal reading instruction (the kindergarten study). The second component is a test of whether the effects of the vocabulary instruction in kindergarten are sustained beyond the intervention period, in grade 1 (the grade 1 follow-up study). This report presents the findings from the grade 1 follow-up study, which followed students who were part of the kindergarten sample into grade 1. During grade 1, no students received K-PAVE; the study was designed to determine whether the impacts found at the end of kindergarten were sustained in grade 1. The report also presents supplemental findings on impacts at the end of kindergarten and discusses outcomes that were not addressed in the kindergarten report. Appended are: (1) K-PAVE Materials Provided to Teachers; (2) Sample Weekly Unit from K-PAVE Program; (3) List of K-PAVE Target Words; (4) Mississippi Counties with Study Schools; (5) Exploratory Analyses of Kindergarten Impacts on Components of Classroom Vocabulary and Comprehension Support, Student Lexical Diversity, and Teacher Lexical Diversity; (6) Statistical Power Analysis; (7) Random Assignment; (8) Recruitment and Random Selection of the Student Sample; (9) Comparison of Students Missing and Not Missing Baseline Assessment; (10) Model Specifications; (11) Sensitivity Analyses; (12) Imputation of Missing Data; (13) Data Collection Procedures; (14) Data Quality Assurance Procedures; (15) School, Teacher, and Student Covariates; (16) Unadjusted Sample Means and Standard Deviations for Outcome Measures; (17) Classroom Observation Measures Used to Create Vocabulary and Comprehension Support Outcome Variables; and (18) Teacher Survey.

Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure; however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies. ","Comments":"Effect size DE: CELF Expressive Vocab, YARC Listening comp and APT Information as primary these match the oral language aims.

The authors tested whether the beneficial effects of storybook reading would be greater when children were active participants as compared to children who participated in a regular shared book-reading situation. Book reading occurred in groups of eight children, and all children were exposed to the same books, read twice. The results of this study revealed that children with limited vocabularies learned new vocabulary from shared book-reading episodes. Children in the dialogic-reading condition made significantly larger gains in vocabulary introduced in the books, as well as gains on a standardized expressive vocabulary test, than did the children in a regular book-reading situation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hargrave Anne C; Senechal Monique ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0885-2006(99)00038-1","Keywords":"Comparative Analysis\r\nIntervention\r\nPreschool Children\r\nPreschool Education\r\nReading Aloud To Others\r\nStory Reading\r\nVocabulary Development\r\nVocabulary Skills","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hargrave Anne C, and Senechal Monique (2000) A book reading intervention with preschool children who have limited vocabularies: The benefits of regular reading and dialogic reading.

Although vocabulary development consistently emerges as a critical literacy skill for young children, many youngsters lag behind in word knowledge because of little exposure to a variety of children's books during their preschool years. Eighty preschool children from suburban preschools, inner-city preschools, and home schools were randomly assigned to a treatment or comparison group where they received either audiobooks or art supplies over 10 weeks. All children involved in the study were given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Forms A and B) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test in order to measure receptive and expressive vocabulary development. A pretest-posttest design was implemented in order to examine the effects on word knowledge when young children listen independently to audiobooks. Data analysis indicated that the children assigned to the experimental group saw a significant increase their receptive and expressive word knowledge. The children who scored the lowest during the initial pretesting experienced the largest gains after treatment was instituted. Although the frequency with which the treatment group listened to the audiobooks was related to the amount of increase in receptive vocabulary, there was no such correlation for expressive vocabulary development. Other demographic variables were also analyzed with varying results. Parents of the treatment group children overwhelmingly reported their children enjoyed listening to the audiobooks. Based on these results, the following two major conclusions can be drawn: (a) independent listening of children's books on audiotape can significantly increase a preschool child's receptive and expressive vocabulary, and (b) the lower the child's initial vocabulary scores, the greater the gain after treatment has been initiated.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

In this study, the following questions were investigated: (I) Would instruction in aural cloze improve the children's vocabulary? (II) Would instruction in aural cloze improve the children's listening comprehension? The subjects for this investigation were 39 boys and 38 girls comprising the kindergarten population of the Hillsdale School in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The kindergarten students were assigned by the two kindergarten teachers to two a.m. and two p.m. sessions. One intact a.m. session taught by one teacher and one intact p.m. session taught by the other teacher were selected as the experimental group. The experimental group consisted of 40 subjects, 20 boys and 20 girls. The other intact a.m. session taught by one teacher and the other p.m. session taught by the other teacher became the control group. The control group consisted of 37 subjects, 19 boys and 18 girls. As part of the on-going kindergarten curriculum, the teachers selected and read storybooks to the children. These storybooks were used in the construction of the aural cloze materials. Meaning-bearing words were systematically deleted from these storybooks. During the aural cloze instruction, the teachers read the specially prepared storybooks and stopped reading and looked at the children to signal that a word had been deleted. The children then supplied words which could complete the passage and still \"make sense.\" Each word supplied by the children was discussed and its relationship to the context explored. The children in the experimental group received the aural cloze instruction four days a week for ten weeks. The children in the control group were read the same storybooks which were used in the aural cloze instruction, but no deletions were made and there were no discussions of vocabulary. . . .

This study examined the influence of small-group storybook reading sessions on the acquisition of vocabulary words for at-risk kindergartners, and the impact of word elaboration on learning. An additional goal was to study differential responses to treatment for children with high versus low vocabulary skill. Method: Using a pretest–posttest comparison group research design, 57 kindergartners were randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 29) or comparison (n = 28) group. Children were also differentiated into high (n = 31) versus low (n = 26) vocabulary skill groups using scores on a standardized receptive vocabulary test. Children in the treatment group completed 20 small-group storybook reading sessions during which they were exposed to 60 novel words randomly assigned to non-elaborated and elaborated conditions. Pre and posttest examined the quality of children’s definitions for the 60 novel words. Results: Overall, word-learning gains were modest. Children in the treatment group made significantly greater gains in elaborated words relative to children in the comparison group; no influence of storybook reading exposure was seen for non-elaborated words. Children with low vocabulary scores made the greatest gains on elaborated words. Clinical Implications: Suggestions are offered for using storybooks as a clinical tool for fostering vocabulary development. As an efficacy study, results should inform future applied research on word learning for at-risk children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Justice Laura M; Meier Joanne ; Walpole Sharon ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1044/0161-1461(2005/003)","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Justice Laura M, Meier Joanne, and Walpole Sharon (2005) Learning new words from storybooks: An efficacy study with at-risk kindergartners.

First, teachers in the high-dose print-referencing group attended an 8-hr workshop before the academic school year in which they were given (a) information on children  s print knowledge and emergent literacy development, (b) an overview of how to read with a print-referencing style and prior findings of its efficacy, and (c) hands-on practice incorporating references to print in read-aloud sessions with workshop partners. Second, teachers received two brief feedback letters (at weeks 8 and 22) detailing strengths and areas for improvement regarding their use of a print-referencing style. This feedback letter was tailored to each individual teacher and was de- veloped by research staff who had reviewed the designated week  s videotaped book-reading session (submitted to the research team by the teacher for fidelity purposes).

Concerning the titles and reading schedule, teach- ers were provided a set of 30 commercially available children  s texts in the fall of the year. The texts were carefully selected so that each contained a number of interesting print features such as font changes and character speech bubbles; the presence of such features in books is influential to how often preschool teachers will comment on print during read-alouds (Zucker, Justice, & Piasta, 2009). Teachers also\"\n\"received a schedule specifying a specific title to be read during each week of the academic year (see Justice et al., 2009).\"\n\"The reading schedule was identical for all teachers. Teachers were asked to read each week  s scheduled book four times within a given week and to have no more than one read- aloud session within a day; however, the exact days of the week and the time of day at which the teacher conducted the read-alouds was left to the discretion of the teacher. Additionally, teachers were asked to conduct the read-aloud with the entire class in a whole-class session. At the end of a given week of reading, teachers were asked to place the completed book in the classroom library and to not read it again as a whole-class activity. Teachers were told that they could engage in any additional read-aloud activities that they liked, to include whole-class and small-group sessions, but that these should not include the study books.\"\n\"Concerning the scope, sequence, and frequency of print-related targets to be addressed during read-alouds, a set of 15 print knowl- edge targets (i.e., objectives) were linked to each book that was read over the 30 weeks. All teachers in the high-dose print-referencing condition were to follow this prescribed scope and sequence of in- struction for the entirety of the intervention. Specifically, each week, teachers would read a prescribed book and would address two print knowledge targets each time they read the book. Across weeks, the focus of instruction cycled across instructional targets to provide children with a balanced and varied exposure to the targets through- out the 30 weeks of the program.\"\n\"teachers were given gen- eral suggestions on how to use verbal (e.g., questioning about print) and nonverbal (e.g., tracking the print) references to make print a salient aspect of read-aloud sessions and to address the 15 targets. Teachers were asked to try to address each print target approximately two times in a read-aloud session.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"justice2010.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215576,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":359949,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Information regarding the average SES of pupils in each class- room was created by aggregating individual family income informa- tion for each of the participating children per classroom, collected from children  s parents in the fall of the academic year through a parental questionnaire.

It also examined 8 specific child- and setting-level moderatorsto determine whether these influenced the relation between teachers' use of a print-referencing style and children's print-knowledge development. Method: In this randomized controlled trial, 59 teachers were randomly assigned to 2 conditions. Teachers in the experimental group (n = 31) integrated explicit references to specified print targets within each of 120 read-aloud sessions conducted in their classrooms over a 30-week period; comparison teachers (n = 28) read the same set of book titles along the same schedule but read using their business-as-usual reading style. Children's gains over the 30-week period on a composite measure of print knowledge were compared for a subset of children who were randomly selected from the experimental (n = 201) and comparison (n = 178) classrooms. Results: When controlling for fall print knowledge, child age, and classroom quality, children who experienced a print-referencing style of reading had significantly higher print knowledge scores in the spring than did children in the comparison classroom. None of the child-level (age, initial literacy skills, language ability) or setting-level characteristics (program type, instructional quality, average level of classroom socioeconomic status, teachers' education level, teachers' experience) significantly moderated intervention effects. Clinical Implications: Considered in tandem with prior study findings concerning this approach to emergent literacy intervention, print-focused read-alouds appear to constitute an evidence-based practice with net positive impacts on children's literacy development. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.","Comments":"No oral language component for pupils mentioned.\rPlease code as code as listening in the Strand Specific Codeset","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Justice L M; McGinty A S; Piasta S B; Kaderavek J N; Fan X ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1044/0161-1461(2010/09-0056)","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Justice L M, McGinty A S, Piasta S B, Kaderavek J N, and Fan X (2010) Print-focused read-alouds in preschool classrooms: Intervention effectiveness and moderators of child outcomes.

paper describes the development and effects of a story-reading program (STaR) oil the language and comprehension of disadvantaged prekindergarten and kindergarten students. The story-reading program was developed as a part of a school restructuring effort, Success for All. STaR contains materials (sequence cards, flannel board materials), and methods (retelling, dramatization) to facilitate the effective use of stories in classrooms. Individual students from a matched control school were matched with experimental students in the program assessment. The Merrill Language Screening Test and the TOLD were individually administered to 206 prekindergarten (43 matched pairs) and kindergarten students (60 matched pairs) to measure program effects on language. Positive effects for program ranged from.24 to 3.75. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Adult interactive strategies while adults read to children serve to draw the child's attention to the story. However, the impact of specific adult interactive strategies on the complexity and types of comments by children has not been studied extensively. This study was designed to investigate whether the specific strategies of commenting or questioning by the adult would influence the complexity as well the types of spontaneous comments to story details made by children when listening to stories. Twenty four subjects, ranging in age from 3 years, 10 months to 6 years, 5 months, listened to a series of five different stories over a three week period in their preschool classrooms. The preschoolers were assigned to two experimental and one control group. Familiar adults employed commenting, questioning, or general reading, with each group respectively. Children in the comment group produced spontaneous utterances with greater complexity than those children in the question group. The type of interactive strategy employed by the adults also influenced significantly the types of comments made about different aspects of the stories by the children. Commenting by the adults contributed to a greater percentage of child utterances regarding the story meaning while questioning by the adults contributed to a greater percentage of child utterances about the story structure and print.","Comments":"3 arms: please code \" reading with interaction/comments\" as treatment condition and \"reading\" as control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kertoy Marilyn K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02568549409594953","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kertoy Marilyn K (1994) Adult interactive strategies and the spontaneous comments of preschoolers during joint storybook readings.

As described above, these\rwords were judged to be relatively difficult for children\rof this age and were the most difficult words in the book. Each word was orally presented to the children and three optional meanings were suggested. The children were asked to choose the best meaning. For example, the children were asked: ‘What is the meaning of the word “container” (in Hebrew meihal)? (a) Is it a big truck? (b) Is it a big bottle? or (c) Is it a mail box?’ Before they were tested, to prepare them for the task,\rthe children were given two examples in which the\rresearchers provided the answer.

We investigated 128 5- to 6-year-old kindergarteners 64 children from each of two socio-economic status (SES) groups: low (LSES) and middle (MSES). In each group, children were randomly assigned to one of three subgroups. The two intervention groups included three book reading sessions each children in one group individually read the electronic book in the second group, the children were read the same printed book by an adult children in the third group, which served as a control, received the regular kindergarten programme. Pre- and post-intervention emergent literacy measures included vocabulary, word recognition and phonological awareness. Compared with the control group, the children's vocabulary scores in both intervention groups improved following reading activity. Children from both interventions groups and both SES groups showed a similarly good level of story comprehension. In both SES groups, compared with the control group, children's phonological awareness and word recognition did not improve following both reading interventions. Implications for future research and for education are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Korat Ofra ; Shamir A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00213.x","Keywords":"Reading Skills\r\nIntervention\r\nEmergent Literacy\r\nElectronic Publishing\r\nChildrens Literature\r\nReading Aloud To Others\r\nPrinted Materials\r\nKindergarten\r\nYoung Children\r\nSocioeconomic Influences\r\nLow Income Groups\r\nComparative Analysis\r\nProgram Effectiveness\r\nVocabulary Development\r\nWord Recognition\r\nReading Comprehension","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Korat Ofra, and Shamir A (2007) Electronic books versus adult readers: Effects on children's emergent literacy as a function of social class.

Thirty-six children, ages three to five, attending a day care center serving a minority, racial group in a low-economic area were randomly placed into three treatment groups and one control group. All of the subjects were administered three pre-tests and three post-tests. For ten weeks the researcher met with the three treatment groups on a daily basis. Groups One and Two heard the same stories, the difference between the groups being the amount of language interaction initiated by the researcher. Group Three worked freely with art materials. The effect of the reading aloud, language interaction and the interaction of the two were each addressed by the three post-tests. Analysis of covariance was used to measure differences, the covariates being the three pre-tests and ages of the subjects. There were no statistically significant results from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or Development of Oral Language test. The results from the Concepts About Print test did show a statistically significant effect from reading aloud. Results from the Concepts About Print test did not show statistically significant effects for language interaction or the combination of reading aloud and language interaction, however. Subsequent analysis of the means and standard deviations for each of the four groups, on each of the post-tests, plus a look at the gains and losses made by the subjects from the pre-tests to the post-tests did provide some interesting insight into possible reasons for the lack of significance in this study. Some possible variables examined were: group dynamics, actual language interaction occurrences, size of groups, age variations in groups, length of study, and physical setting and situation.","Comments":"4 arms: Please code \"read aloud with language interaction\" as treatment condition and \"no planned read-aloud program\" as control group","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Lamb Holly ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Preschool Education\r\nEducation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lamb Holly (1986) The effects of a read-aloud program with language interaction (early childhood, preschool children's literature). , Florida State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":359172,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Repeated Read-Aloud Events, Retellings, and Hands-On Science Activities[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Leung_2008.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":359172,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 14:\n[¬s]\"The three informational picture books were read aloud three times each to groups of three or four children at the YWCA Child De- velopment Center.\"\n\" The books were read in this order: (a) What Is a Rainbow?

The videotape contained two assignments, described in Table 2. These procedures were presented as aset of guidelines and were followed by taped vignettes of adult-child book reading that exemplified these guidelines. The version of the videotape used with teachers con- tained asecond section with guidelines specific to using dialogic reading in groups (see Table 2). The final section of the videotape consisted of vignettes of adult- child reading that did not conform to the guidelines. Teachers were asked by the trainer to criticize the reading presented in these vignettes according to the dialogic reading guidelines and to indicate what the adult reader should have done differ- ently.

The children entered the program with oral language skills that were significantly below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) no treatment control, (b) a school condition in which children were read to by their teachers in small groups, (c) a home condition in which children were read to by their parents, and (d) a combined school plus home condition. Parents and teachers were trained in a specific form of interactive reading via an instructional videotape. The intervention was conducted for 6 weeks, after which children were posttested on standardized measures of oral language, and language samples were obtained during a shared reading assessment. Significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and were largest for children in conditions involving home reading.","Comments":"4 arms: please code \"teachers read to children\" as treatment condition and \"no treatment\" as control","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lonigan Christopher J; Whitehurst Grover J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0885-2006(99)80038-6","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lonigan Christopher J, and Whitehurst Grover J (1998) Relative efficacy of parent and teacher involvement in a shared-reading intervention for preschool children from low-income backgrounds.

Language skills of the children were below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) no-treatment control, (b) typical shared-reading condition, and (c) dialogic (interactive) shared-reading condition. For both intervention conditions, undergraduate volunteers read to children in small groups. Following the 6-week intervention, children were posttested on measures of oral language, listening comprehension, and phonological sensitivity. Both interventions produced positive effects. Results favoring dialogic reading were found on a measure of descriptive use of language, whereas results favoring typical shared-reading were found on measures of listening comprehension and alliteration detection.","Comments":"3 arms: please code \" dialogic (interactive) shared-reading\" as treatment condition and \"typical shared reading\" as control.\rQDE: Please code \"dialogic shared reading\" and no treatment control as secondary outcome.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lonigan Christopher J; Anthony Jason L; Bloomfield Brenlee G; Dyer Sarah M; Samwel Corine S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/105381519902200406","Keywords":"Education","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lonigan Christopher J, Anthony Jason L, Bloomfield Brenlee G, Dyer Sarah M, and Samwel Corine S (1999) Effects of two shared-reading interventions on emergent literacy skills of at-risk preschoolers.

Children used \"signing\" during shared reading and sight word instruction. Observations of an ESL student from each of the four kindergarten \"signing\" classes examined the students' interaction with the shared reading text and any use of sign language during direct and indirect teaching. Teachers were interviewed, analyzing their observations and perspectives of using sign language in their classrooms. The 135 kindergarteners (35 ESL and 100 non ESL) were from two schools within an urban school district in southeastern Pennsylvania. They attended either morning or afternoon sessions. A pre-test and post-test design measured the receptive vocabulary growth and sight word recognition of students. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Third Edition (PPVT-III) assessed receptive vocabulary. To determine sight word growth, a researcher organized sight word assessment was used. Pre-testing began mid-October 2005, the sign language intervention started in November, and post-tests were administered in May 2006. A rubric containing expected behaviors was used for student observations. Paired sample t tests indicated a significant difference in receptive vocabulary acquisition and sight word recognition for \"signing\" ESL and non ESL kindergarten students. An analysis of covariance was used to analyze English acquisition among ESL and non ESL students that used \"signing\" during the study and those that did not. \"Signing\" ESL students compared with \"signing\" non ESL students on receptive vocabulary measures indicated no significant differences. \"Signing\" ESL students and non ESL students were compared with ESL students and non ESL students that did not \"sign,\" and there were no significant differences. ESL and non ESL students \"signed\" in varying degrees. Teachers experienced \"signing\" as an effective teaching and learning tool indicating it \"built community\" among classmates (students helped each other with \"signs\"). The teachers' and students' gave the emotional response, \"Signing was fun!\"","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

However, community use of printed materials varies, resulting in a large number of nonmainstream children deemed at risk for school failure at an early age. In an effort to address this situation, a study examined the effects of including shared book reading activities in an urban preschool program that identified at-risk children through assessment of child and family characteristics. A year-long intervention supplemented the regular program with weekly classroom reading and sharing of simple books; use of book topics for writing and dramatic play; and shared book reading by parents and children at home. The study employed a quasi-experimental control design with multiple converging measures of children's knowledge of language and literacy constructs and parent questionnaire responses. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed that literacy development can be fostered through the incorporation of shared book reading. Pre- and posttest comparisons also revealed that at-risk children can make substantial growth in language development, print concept awareness, letter knowledge, writing, and reading abilities.

A total of 53 inner-city, low socioeconomic status (SES) subjects participated in the 20-week study. Subjects were dichotomized at the median on a measure of development level into average- and delayed-development level groups and were then randomly assigned from each of the two development strata to two experimental groups and to one control group. The subjects in Experimental Group 1 were exposed to adult-interactive behaviors during repeated readings of \"big book\" story-books. Subjects in Experimental Group 2 were exposed to repeated \"big book\" storybook readings without adult interaction. Control group subjects participated in the regular prekindergarten curricular activities. Two separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed on the subjects' scores on the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) and on the Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA). The analysis of the PLS data indicated a significant main effect of treatment (p $<$.0001). Subjects in both experimental groups scored significantly higher than control group subjects, but there was no difference between the two experimental groups. The one-way ANCOVA test for main effects of treatment on the TERA was not statistically significant. Subjects' scores on the PLS and TERA were also subjected to two separate, two-way (development level by treatment) analyses of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVAs confirmed the significant treatment effect on the PLS and nonsignificant treatment effect on the TERA and indicated significant development level effects on both instruments in the expected direction (i.e., average-development level subjects scored significantly higher than delayed-development level subjects). There were no significant interaction effects between development levels and treatments. The results suggested that the language development of low SES prekindergarten students identified as being at risk of academic failure could be enhanced through repeated storybook readings, whether or not the adult who was reading aloud initiated interactive behaviors. Informal observation revealed that the children in Experimental Group 2 generated the interactive behaviors themselves.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Questioning and discussion focused on the structure of stories as well as traditional (literal, inferential, and critical) questioning and discussion were investigated. The stories were read to children using the DRA format of pre- and postquestioning and discussion. Story structure treatment groups (N = 73) received structural questions and discussion; traditional treatment groups (N = 64) received traditional comprehension questions and discussion; and the combined treatment groups (N = 57) received a combination of both. The control groups (N = 60) heard stories with no pre- or postquestions or discussion. The results indicated that the use of the DRA when reading stories to children significantly improved comprehension. Traditional and structural treatment groups each significantly improved performance on traditional and structural questions, respectively. Each treatment also had a small positive effect on children's ability to answer the other type of question. The combined treatment group made the greatest gains. When differences occurred between achievement levels within the treatment groups, it was the high and middle achievers whose scores increased. None of the treatments significantly increased performance of the low achievers.","Comments":"4 arms: please code \"traditional questions\" as treatment group versus control group.\rQDE: Please code \"traditional questions\" as primary outcome and \"story structure questions\" as secondary outcome\"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morrow Lesley Mandel; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10862968409547521","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morrow Lesley Mandel (1984) Reading stories to young children: Effects of story structure and traditional questioning strategies on comprehension.

A study was designed to investigate whether frequent one-to-one readings in a school setting would increase the number & complexity of comments & questions from children of low socioeconomic status (SES). Ss (N = 79 low-SES four-year-olds) were assigned to two experimental groups & one control group. Ss in group 1 were read a different book each week for 10 weeks. Those in group 2 heard repeated readings of three different books. In both groups, interactive behavior between adult & child was encouraged during story readings. The control group was guided through traditional reading readiness activities. It was found that one-to-one story readings did increase the number & complexity of questions & comments made by children in both experimental groups. Different book readings were found to result in more literal responses such as labeling & mentioning details. Children's responses were also more illustration-related in this group. Repeated readings were found to result in more interpretive responses & more responses focusing on print & story structure. Repeated readings were most effective with children of low ability. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 71 References. Modified AA","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Quiet book reading. During quiet book reading, teachers and students all se- lected one or two books each to look at for a short period of time. 2. Teacher directed literature activities. The format in each day's teacher-directed literature activity was that of the DLTA, which provided a framework of ques- tion, prediction, and discussion both before and after a story reading. Teachers had a variety of activities suggested for sharing books with children from which they could choose. Some of these included: (a) reading for pleasure; (b) role playing and retelling stories; (c) repeated readings of favorite stories; (d) shared book experiences, which included children's participation in story readings; (e) using literature related to content area subjects; and (f) other ideas prepared by the teachers themselves. Activities included such events as preparing and eating bread and jam after listening to the story Bread and Jam for Frances (Hoban, 1960). Stories were told using puppets, feltboard characters, and props. Chil- dren were encouraged to model storytelling techniques used by the teacher during the recreational reading periods. 3. The recreational reading period. Children in the experimental group were free to select any materials from the Literacy Center (or library corner) during recre- ational reading. They were allowed to work either individually or with others. The area was designed to contain books, magazines, roll movies, story cassettes, Big Books, Viewmasters, feltboard characters, and puppets. Blank paper, mark- ers, glue, crayons, and pencils were available so children could create their own books. The purpose was to spend independent time involved with literature and literature related materials. 4. Summary of the day. The summary of the day convened the entire class for 5 to 10 minutes of discussion about the story reading events that had taken place with the youngsters in the experimental group during the day.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Morrow etal_1990.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":356169,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\" the program components, which included: (a) quiet book reading, (b) a teacher-directed literature activity, (c) a recreational reading period, and (d) a summary of the day.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Morrow etal_1990.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"To support at-risk children's literacy development","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":356169,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\" to examine the effects of a storybook reading program with respect to the literacy development of urban at-risk children.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Morrow etal_1990.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215493,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":356169,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"month to discuss the program for its duration.

Children in four experimental classes followed a daily program of literature experiences that included reading for pleasure, story retelling, repeated readings of favorite stories, interactive story reading, recreational reading periods, and others. During the same period of time, students in four control groups followed the prescribed reading readiness program used in the district that emphasized letter recognition and letter-sound correspondence. Based on the results of pretests in September and posttests in May, the experimental groups scored significantly better than the control groups on story retellings, attempted reading of favorite stories, comprehension tests, and other measures. There were no significant differences between the groups on standardized measures of reading readiness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morrow Lesley Mandel; O'Connor Ellen M; Smith Jeffrey K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10862969009547710","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morrow Lesley Mandel, O'Connor Ellen M, and Smith Jeffrey K (1990) Effects of a story reading program on the literacy development of at-risk kindergarten children.

From the total population of 106 four-year-olds, 45 were randomly selected for the experimental group and 45 for the control group. Each group was then subdivided into 15 groups of 3 children each.The children in the experimental group were read a different story at each meeting.The children in the control group met with research assistants and worked on reading read.ness tasks in small groups, focusing on identification of colors, shapes and letters. Research assistants conducted the 2nd and 11th story reading sessions \nin both groups as pre- and posttest measures. The stories were introduced, and children were encouraged to ask questions or to comment during the story. The responses of children on the tapes of these sessions provided pre- and posttest data. This investigation revealed that reading to children in small groups with guided adult interactive behavior increased verbal participation and complexity of that verbal interchange. Children in the experimental group asked more questions and made more comments than those in the control group. Small group readings in a school setting can increase low-SES children's question and comment responses to literature in both number and complexity, providing a rich source of informat ion for the child. _MR","Comments":"CODERS: Please use the OCR version for highlighting.

During book reading the teacher or adult asks the children questions, encourages answers and helps the children to develop more sophisticated responses to the text. After a few sessions, children are asked to become more active participants in the book reading experience by becoming the storytellers. Appendix A provides the intervention schedule including the list of titles utilized in this study. The storybooks selected for use in this study were based on the recommendations of the creators of the Dialogic Reading technique (Whitehurst et al., 1994). The following is a description of key components of the Dialogic Reading technique followed by a description of prompts used during reading: Key Components Prompt. The children are prompted to say something about the book or page (for example, \"What's this? Tell me about this page?). Individual students are called on to offer comments about what story is being told on a given page. Evaluate. Individual responses are evaluated by the teacher and the child is asked another question that will pinpoint specifics about the text. Expand. When a child offers a response, the teacher adds information to the response so that all the children can hear the details of the story. Repeat. The teacher repeats the childs responses to make sure the other children hear the response. This also gives the child a chance to clarify his/her response if desired.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Murphy_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":357523,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 61:\n[¬s]\"Completion. This type of prompt is used when the teacher leaves a blank at the end of the sentence in order to let the child predict the final word. This is most often used when working with rhyming material, but can also be used with predictable text. Recall. This type of prompt requires asking questions about what occurred on a specific page or to summarize the main parts of a story. Recall questions can also be asked prior to reading a storybook. Open ended. This type of questioning involves asking students to describe what is happening in a specific picture in the book. This prompt works best with storybooks that contain richly detailed illustration. W prompts. These prompts simply refer to asking what, when, where, why, and how questions. Distancing. For this component, children are asked to relate the pictures or words to their own life experiences. Distancing questions help children with verbal fluency, conversation abilities, and narrative skills (for example, \"Tell me about a time you felt afraid\").[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Murphy_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215567,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215573,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215518,"AdditionalText":"3","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":357523,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 55:\n[¬s]\" The interventions were delivered during three consecutive school days each week[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Murphy_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215519,"AdditionalText":"15","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":357523,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 55:\n[¬s]\".

TOPEL provides measures of Print Knowledge and Phonological Awareness. Print Knowledge on this subtest is measured in terms of a childs ability to identify what constitutes a letter or a word, letter identification, and letter sound correspondence. Phonological Awareness on this subtest is measured by a childs ability to manipulate sounds in words (elision) and the childs ability to reconstruct words after segmentation by the administrator.

of two language and literacy interventions on the emergent literacy and language skills of 27, four and five-year old children in three Head Start classrooms. Interventions took place three times per week for approximately fifteen minutes over an eight week period. One intervention, WordWork (Calfee, Norman, Trainin, & Wilson, 2001 Calfee & Patrick, 1995) provided explicit instruction in print knowledge and phonological awareness. The second intervention, Dialogic Reading (Whitehurst, Falco et al., 1988), involved interactive storybook reading designed to provide opportunities to enhance language and vocabulary development with young children. The control group received no intervention beyond the curriculum, Creative Curriculum® (Dodge, Colker, Heroman, & Bickart, 2002), offered in the classroom. After an eight-week intervention, children in the WordWork group performed significantly higher on measures of print knowledge and phonological awareness skills than children in both the Dialogic Reading group and the control group. The children in the WordWork group performed significantly higher than students in the control group in oral language ability. The substantial gains in performance made by the children in the WordWork group are attributed to the developmentally appropriate nature of the explicit instruction provided in the program combined with the social constructivist nature of the lessons. Implications for classroom practice are offered, as well as directions for future research.","Comments":"Code \"dialogic reading\" as treatment condition vs control group","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Murphy Malinda ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Preschool Education\r\nCurricula\r\nTeaching\r\nEducation\r\nHead Start\r\nOral Language\r\nPhonological Awareness\r\nPreschool Children\r\nPrint Knowledge","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Murphy Malinda (2007) Enhancing print knowledge, phonological awareness, and oral language skills with at -risk preschool children in Head Start classrooms. , University of Nebraska-Lincoln."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215229,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":359477,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Little Books program[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Phillips etal_1990_OCR_R.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":359477,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\" determine whether a beneficial effect on children’s literacy development accrues from the use of the Little Books with kindergarten children[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Phillips etal_1990_OCR_R.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215246,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":359477,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"schools were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups (home, home and school, school, and control).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Phillips etal_1990_OCR_R.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215251,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":359477,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"The study was conducted in Newfoundland, Canada.

Neither treatment nor site had significant effects on either posttest. However, there was a significant MET-1 X Treatment interaction in the univariate case with MET-2 as the dependent variable. The interaction occurred as follows: in the home and school and school only treatments, students scoring lowest on MET-1 performed worse on MET-2 than the control group, while students scoring highest on MET-1 performed better on MET-2 than the control group; for the home only treatment, students scoring lowest on MET- 1 scored higher on MET-2 than students in the control group, while students scoring highest on MET-1 performed the same as students in the control group.\"\n\"There was a significant MET-1 X Site interaction in the multivariate case.

From a sample of 40, schools were grouped into rural village(drawing students form only one small community), rural collector (drawing students form a number of small communities), and urban. From each of these groupings, four schools were randomly selected. From each group of four, schools were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups (Little Books used in the home only, Little Books used in the home and school, Little Books used in the school only, and control). Eighteen classes of kindergarten children from 12 schools participated in the study.Complete pretest and posttest data were obtained for 309 children. Quantitative analyses showed the children entering kindergarten in this study to be at risk of school failure. On average, urban kindergartners scored higher on all measures, and village and collector students scored about the same. Differences in posttest means were not related clearly to treatment. However, the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Pretest x Treatment interaction, which showed that the lowest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they were used at home only and the highest achieving students when they used in school only, helps to support the hypothesis that the home has a crucial role to play in literacy development.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The participants were 125 children, who the researchers stratified by classroom and randomly assigned to one of two shared book-reading conditions (i.e., the experimental, Words of Oral Reading and Language Development [WORLD] intervention; or typical practice). Results on researcher-developed measures showed statistically and practically significant effects for the WORLD intervention with no differential effects for children with higher versus lower entry-level vocabulary knowledge. The researchers detected no statistically significant differences on standardized measures. Results suggest that a combination of instructional factors may be necessary to enhance the efficacy of shared book reading for children with early vocabulary difficulties. © 2011 Council for Exceptional Children.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

provide an estimate of the subject's verbal intelligence through his hearing vocabu­ lary. This instrument was developed by Lloyd M. Dunn of the George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee. This instrument consists of three practice and ISO test plates, each of which contains four numbered pictures. Alternate forms are available by using the same plates, but designating a different stimulus word for Form A and Form B. The examiner says the stimulus word and the subject responds by indicating orally or by pointing to the picture which best illustrates the word. Items are arranged in ascending order. The subject's basal response is de­ termined by giving the correct response to eight consecutive stimulus words. The subject's ceiling is reached when he experiences six failures out of eight consecutive responses. The directions for administering the test suggest appro­ priate starting points for different ages. The subject's score is determined by subtracting the number of incorrect responses from his ceiling response score. The subject's score can be converted into three types of derived scores: percentile rank, mental age, or standard score deviation IQ with a means of 100 and a standard deviation of fifteen.","Data1":0.3596,"Data2":0.26,"Data3":0,"Data4":0,"Data5":0,"Data6":0,"Data7":0,"Data8":0,"Data9":0,"Data10":0,"Data11":0,"Data12":0,"Data13":0,"Data14":0,"InterventionText":"Literacy: speaking and listening/oral language","ControlText":"With business as usual","OutcomeText":"Primary outcome","feWeight":0,"reWeight":0,"SMD":0.3596,"SESMD":0.26,"R":0,"SER":0,"OddsRatio":0,"SEOddsRatio":0,"RiskRatio":0,"SERiskRatio":0,"CIUpperSMD":0.8692,"CILowerSMD":-0.15000000000000008,"CIUpperR":0,"CILowerR":0,"CIUpperOddsRatio":0,"CILowerOddsRatio":0,"CIUpperRiskRatio":0,"CILowerRiskRatio":0,"CIUpperRiskDifference":0,"CILowerRiskDifference":0,"CIUpperPetoOddsRatio":0,"CILowerPetoOddsRatio":0,"CIUpperMeanDifference":0,"CILowerMeanDifference":0,"RiskDifference":0,"SERiskDifference":0,"MeanDifference":0,"SEMeanDifference":0,"PetoOR":0,"SEPetoOR":0,"ES":0.3596,"SEES":0.26,"NRows":6,"CILower":-0.15000000000000008,"CIUpper":0.8692,"ESDesc":"Effect size","SEDesc":"SE","Data1Desc":"SMD","Data2Desc":"standard error","Data3Desc":"r","Data4Desc":"SE (Z transformed)","Data5Desc":"odds ratio","Data6Desc":"SE (log OR)","Data7Desc":"risk ratio","Data8Desc":"SE (log RR)","Data9Desc":"","Data10Desc":"","Data11Desc":"risk difference","Data12Desc":"standard error","Data13Desc":"mean difference","Data14Desc":"standard error","OutcomeCodes":{"OutcomeItemAttributesList":[{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407003,"AttributeName":"With business as usual","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304996},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407009,"AttributeName":"Sample: All","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304997},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407012,"AttributeName":"Pre-post gain","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304998},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407019,"AttributeName":"Literacy: speaking and listening/oral language","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":304999},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407028,"AttributeName":"Test type: Standardised test ","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":305000},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":5407059,"AttributeName":"Toolkit: Oral language interventions","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":305001},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":7755570,"AttributeName":"Toolkit primary outcome","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":305002},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":7755575,"AttributeName":"Other outcome","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":305003},{"AdditionalText":"","AttributeId":11183748,"AttributeName":"EY_Toolkit: Communication and language approaches","OutcomeId":52981,"OutcomeItemAttributeId":305004}]}},{"OutcomeId":52982,"ItemSetId":49404905,"OutcomeTypeId":0,"OutcomeTypeName":"Continuous","ItemAttributeIdIntervention":5407015,"ItemAttributeIdControl":5407003,"ItemAttributeIdOutcome":5407093,"Title":"The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities score-oral language","ItemTimepointId":0,"ItemTimepointMetric":"","ItemTimepointValue":"","TimepointDisplayValue":" ","ItemArmIdGrp1":0,"ItemArmIdGrp2":0,"grp1ArmName":"","grp2ArmName":"","ShortTitle":"Rainey (1968)","OutcomeDescription":"The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities was developed by James J.

Randomly-selected, 45 Negro Headstart enrollees made up three groups--two were taught the experimental program and one was taught the regular Headstart Program. A fourth group (15 preschool Negro children who remained at home) received no instruction. Mental age and language age means and net increases for the four treatment groups were reported from pretest and post test scores provided by the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. An analysis of variance was applied to the post test data to determine whether differences at the .05 level of significance existed in verbal intelligence and psycholinguistic abilities, and Kramer's Extension of Duncan's Multiple Range Test was used to compare the means of the groups. Results showed that the experimental program can raise intellectual functioning and alleviate language deficiency of Negro preschool culturally deprived children. It did not, however, increase the children's hearing vocabulary. (Author/JM)","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Subjects in the experimental class received instruction in Holdaway's Shared Book Experience Program, a whole language approach, while subjects in the comparison class received instruction in Lippincott's Beginning to Read, Write, and Listen Program, a code emphasis approach. Emergent literacy--the concepts about reading and writing resulting from a child's first encounters with printed material--was divided into three subsets: linguistic, orthographic, and grapho-phonemic literacy. Posttest results for each of these literacy sets indicated a significant treatment effect favoring the whole language group. The results corroborated Holdaway's research, which indicated a high level of success with the Shared Book Experiences in comparison with a code emphasis approach. The study showed a naturalistic learning model to be structured and viable within a school instructional environment that was informal, relaxed, and supportive.

Using a formative research approach, this study examines the design potential of a supplemental vocabulary instruction technique that incorporated research-based instructional elements into a highly structured approach. The intervention design was tested for instructional potential and delivery in 12 Early Reading First classrooms over a 3-month period, and compared to a control group of children in like classrooms on effects. Fidelity of implementation was assessed on three levels of teaching staff: coach, teacher, teacher assistant. Pre/postintervention effects were measured using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and a curriculum-based decision measure. Debriefings with teaching staff were content analyzed. Results show good fidelity of implementation across roles and strong learning outcomes; children responded well to the technique and made significant gains in their vocabulary (PPVT-III) and substantive gains in receptive and expressive vocabulary on a target set of words (curriculum-based decision measure). Additionally the technique appeared relatively easy to adopt and use routinely in the preschool setting. Although limited to an Early Reading First program setting, the design shows promise as a supplemental vocabulary instruction technique.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Roskos Kathleen ; Burstein Karen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02568543.2011.580041","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Roskos Kathleen, and Burstein Karen (2011) Assessment of the design efficacy of a preschool vocabulary instruction technique.

Head Start students (N = 93) in the software conditions received instruction over three months. Pretest/ posttest scores on the Preschool Language Assessment Instrument of the seventy-eight students who completed the program were analyzed with a 3 x 2 repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). No statistically significant differences were found for treatment. A significant difference was found for time. A 3 x 2 analysis of variance with the first factor treatment group and the second factor level of functioning (high/low) was also computed. There was no significant main effect for treatment. However, a significant main effect on the P W I score for low functioning students was found in both computer training conditions.

If children hesitated to respond or said that they did not know the word, the experimenter said that some of the words were hard but to try just the same.

Thirty children for each group of three- and four-year-old children were read one storybook individually. The study included three storybook reading conditions: single-reading, repeated-reading and questioning. In both the repeated-reading and the questioning conditions, the storybook was read three times. Children in the questioning condition were asked, during each reading of the storybook, to label target items with the novel words. Listening to multiple readings of a storybook facilitated children's acquisition of expressive and receptive vocabulary, whereas answering questions during the multiple readings was more helpful to the acquisition of expressive than receptive vocabulary. These findings suggest that, under certain conditions, didactic techniques used by adults have differential effects on preschoolers' receptive and expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"3 arms: please code \"reading with questioning\" as treatment condition and \"single reading\" as control ","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sénéchal M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305000996003005","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sénéchal M (1997) The differential effect of storybook reading on preschoolers' acquisition of expressive and receptive vocabulary.

It is targeted at children with relatively poor spoken language skills. Three sessions per week are delivered to groups of two to four children starting in the final term of nursery and continuing in the first two terms of reception in primary school. Children in primary school also attend an additional two 15-minute individual sessions per week. All sessions focus on listening, narrative and vocabulary skills. Work on phonological awareness is introduced in the final ten weeks. The intervention was developed by researchers from the University of York with funding from the Nuffield Foundation. The communications charity I CAN was enlisted to train teaching assistants and nursery staff to deliver the programme. This report evaluates the I CAN-led model for the 30-week programme described above and also a shorter 20-week version delivered only in reception year. The impact of these two programmes on the language skills of 350 children in 34 schools was tested using a randomised controlled trial design. Schools with attached nursery schools or nursery classes in Yorkshire and the South East were recruited to the trial in 2013. Children identified as having relatively low language skills were randomly allocated to the 30-week programme, the 20-week programme or standard provision. The qualitative fieldwork carried out as part of the project involved interviews with a total of 12 staff in 8 of the 34 participating schools.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Sibieta Luke ; Kotecha Mehul ; Skipp Amy ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sibieta Luke, Kotecha Mehul, and Skipp Amy (2016) Nuffield Early Language Intervention: Evaluation report and executive summary.

Early intervention in critical areas of preschool language (vocabulary, comprehension, and narrative ability) and early literacy skills can facilitate this development. Typical interventions in preschool settings utilize storybooks to target these critical areas. However, research on large group teacher implemented storybook interventions to improve language skills is limited. In this study, Head Start teachers were trained to use a storybook intervention entitled, Storybook Activities for Improving Language (SAIL). The SAIL intervention consisted of four days of teacher led activities built around storybooks incorporating repeated readings, vocabulary activities, and retelling and acting out activities. A main focus was on vocabulary skills with secondary focuses on comprehension, narrative ability, and print awareness. Language and early literacy measures were administered at pre and post test to the SAIL intervention group and a control group. A multivariate analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effectiveness o f SAIL on those measures. A significant effect was found for a vocabulary measure requiring children to name the categories and features o f the target vocabulary words used in the SAIL intervention and for a narrative retell measure requiring children to retell a story within a time limit. There were no significant effects found for vocabulary measures assessing general vocabulary development, comprehension, or print awareness. Based on the results, five conclusions can be drawn: a) the SAIL intervention led to increases in vocabulary skills; b) the SAIL intervention did not lead to increases in comprehension skills; c) the SAIL intervention led to increases in narrative ability; d) SAIL did not lead to increases in print awareness; and e) teachers rated the SAIL intervention favorably upon a program evaluation questionnaire. Despite limitations warranting caution in interpretation, this study added to existing research on storybook interventions in preschool in several ways. First, SAIL showed that a class-wide teacher implemented storybook intervention led to significant gains in vocabulary skills and narrative ability for preschool age children. Second, the four-day activity structure of SAIL was perceived as a beneficial learning experience by teachers.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use optimised version for highlighting.

The study focuses on the degree to which teachers were able to implement such a program, the observable factors which characterized implementing classrooms, and the effects of implementation on the reading-related achievement of kindergarten children. The study was carried out in conjunction with a Right-to-Read grant from the U.S. Office of Education. Subjects for the effects-of-implementation analysis were 124 kindergarten students from four implementing and two nonimplementing classrooms. The results indicate that young children, even those from homes where exposure to a literate environment is not likely to occur, can develop important pre-literacy skills when the right environment is provided in the classroom. The results further indicate that children learn best in a language- and print-rich environment, characterized by many opportunities to observe, try out, and practice literacy skills in genuine communicative situations.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Because these children are known to be at risk for later reading comprehension difficulties, it is important to design and test interventions that foster both literal and inferential language skills. Using a randomized pretest-posttest control group design, we investigated whether an 8-week, one-on-one book-sharing intervention would improve both the literal and inferential language skills of Head Start preschoolers with language impairments. Method: Thirty children were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no intervention or to a treatment group that received twice-weekly 15-min sessions in which adults read books and asked both literal and inferential questions about the books using scripts that were embedded throughout the text. Treatment and control groups were compared using pre- and posttest scores on 2 measures of literal and 1 measure of inferential language skill. Results: Significant group differences, and medium to large effect sizes, were found between pre- and posttest scores for all 3 measures. Conclusions: These findings suggest that book sharing with embedded questions that target both literal and inferential language skills can result in gains on both types of language in this population. Future studies with larger number of children are needed to corroborate these findings.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Three-year-olds were assigned to one of three conditions: vocabulary eliciting questions, noneliciting questions, and no questions (control). General vocabulary comprehension and novel word knowledge were equivalent across the groups before the storybook reading intervention. Children were read 3 storybooks repeatedly across 4 reading sessions and were tested for production and comprehension of novel words in the final session. Children's novel word comprehension increased more in both question conditions than in the control condition, suggesting that type of question is not as important to word learning as children's active engagement in discussion about novel words in general. Novel word production was not strongly affected by any of the reading conditions. However, asking children noneliciting questions did appear to foster production of new words more than not asking questions at all.","Comments":"3 arms: please code \"vocabulary eliciting questions\" as treatment condition and \"no questions\" as control","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Walsh Bridget A; Blewitt Pamela ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-005-0052-0","Keywords":"Questioning Techniques\r\nStory Reading\r\nVocabulary Development\r\nPreschool Children\r\nReceptive Language\r\nExpressive Language\r\nIntervention\r\nDiscussion (Teaching Technique)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Walsh Bridget A, and Blewitt Pamela (2006) The effect of questioning style during storybook reading on novel vocabulary acquisition of preschoolers.

In an effort to examine adult qualitative variations in shared storybook readings, two experiments were conducted to assess the effect of noneliciting questions during shared storybook reading on children's receptive and expressive novel vocabulary learning. The sociocultural perspective was the theoretical framework of this dissertation study and maintains that learning is due to socially meaningful activity of the child within the environment (e.g., Bruner, 1983; Vygotsky, 1978). In the first experiment, 45 children enrolled in monolingual Head Start classrooms were ranked by general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of three conditions: vocabulary noneliciting questions, vocabulary eliciting questions, and no questions (control). In the second experiment, the novel vocabulary learning of 54 children enrolled in a bilingual English-Spanish Head Start program was investigated. In the second experiment, participants were ranked by Spanish general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) Spanish vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (2) English vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (3) Spanish labels, and (4) English labels. Experiment 1 utilized the methodological framework employed in previous experimental work on storybook reading: pretest, intervention, and posttest with the addition of a delayed posttest in Experiment 1. Vocabulary noneliciting questions, eliciting questions, and no questions appear to be equally effective. There was no decay of the words learned as determined by delayed post-test. Experiment 2's methodological framework resembles that utilized by Justice (2002) conducted with a monolingual sample. Experiment 2 also utilized other methodological considerations from the existing literature to examine the effects of noneliciting questions on the novel vocabulary learning of bilingual preschoolers. Experiment 2 revealed that English labels are more effective than English noneliciting questions for receptive knowledge. Spanish noneliciting questions lead to greater expressive word learning than Spanish labels. This study has a number of major impacts, including comparison of Experiment 1's results to the extant literature which is instructive; and, while there is a preponderance of literature with monolingual populations, research with bilingual populations is limited, thus Experiment 2 helps to close that gap.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Teachers read books to children and reinforced vocabulary in the books by presenting objects that represented the words and providing opportunities to use the words. The teachers also were trained to ask open-ended questions and to engage children in conversations about the book and activities. This provided children with opportunities to use language and learn vocabulary in a meaningful context. Children who were in the interactive book reading intervention group scored significantly better than children in the comparison group on Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III and other measures of receptive and expressive language. Book reading and related activities can promote the development of language and literacy skills in young children.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Teachers were trained in specific book reading and conversation strategies. The focus of the intervention was to train teachers how to increase opportunities for language and vocabulary development in young children. At the end of the year, children in the intervention classrooms performed significantly better than children in the control classrooms on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III and the Expressive One-Word Vocabulary Test (3rd ed.). In addition, teachers in the intervention classrooms used strategies that promoted language development during book reading and other classroom activities. Head Start teachers can be trained to implement strategies that have positive effects on children's language and literacy development.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wasik Barbara A; Bond Mary Alice; Hindman Annemarie ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.63","Keywords":"Emergent Literacy\r\nPreschool Children\r\nDisadvantaged Youth\r\nIntervention\r\nTeacher Education\r\nVocabulary Development\r\nChild Language\r\nClassroom Techniques\r\nProgram Effectiveness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wasik Barbara A, Bond Mary Alice, and Hindman Annemarie (2006) The effects of a language and literacy intervention on Head Start children and teachers.

The procedures for the adult in Table 3 were presented as a set of rules and were followed by taped vignettes of adult-child book reading that exemplified those rules. Afinalsection of the videotape consisted of vignettes of inappropriate adult-child book reading. Teachers were asked by the trainer to criticize the readers in the vignettes in terms of the rules of dialogic reading and to indicate what the adult reader should have done differently in response to the child. Following the videotape, the trainer engaged in role play with the teach- ers being trained, which involved presenting various examples of child behavior and giving the teacher feedback on her use ofthe dialogic read- ing rules.

The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 months behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (b) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (c) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests.
