delinquents have consistently been shown to function at lower stages of moral reasoning than nondelinquents, it was hypothesized that adolescents at risk for juvenile delinquency would benefit both cognitively and behaviorally from an intervention designed to accelerate moral reasoning development. Subsequent to participation in a cognitively based moral reasoning development program (16-20 weekly 45-min sessions), adolescents identified by teachers as aggressive and/or disruptive (compared with matched and randomly assigned nonparticipating controls) demonstrated (a) advance in moral reasoning stage and (b) improvement on several behavioral indexes, including behavior referrals, tardiness, academic performance, and police/court contacts (results approached significance for teacher ratings). For a subgroup, 1-year follow-up data showed significant effects for moral reasoning, behavior referrals, and academic performance, as well as teacher ratings and absenteeism. Moral reasoning change scores were associated with all outcome change scores for pre- to posttest and with grades for posttest to follow-up. © 1986 American Psychological Association.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arbuthnot J ; Gordon D A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.54.2.208","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arbuthnot J, and Gordon D A (1986) Behavioral and Cognitive Effects of a Moral Reasoning Development Intervention for High-Risk Behavior-Disordered Adolescents.

(2) the parent training program will be effective for non-helping parents or only for helping parents? The Devereux Elementary School Behavior Scale (DESB) developed by Spivak (1967) was used to detect changes in classroom behavior. The Metropolitan Achievement Test was used to measure gains in achievement. Data were processed in the Arizona State University's Computer Center. Using a multi variate analysis of variance (MANOVA), the null hypotheses were tested at .05 level of significance. The findings showed that it was possible for the parents to increase motivation and desirable classroom behavior in their children. Also, it was concluded that the parent training program was effective for both helping and for non-helping parents. A list of all students from third to eighth grade who lived with both parents was compiled. Based on the teacher's evaluation, the list of the parents was divided into two groups (1) helping parents and (2) non-helping parents. From each group a sample of 24 parents was randomly selected. Sixteen parents from each group were assigned to the experimental group. The other 16 parents (8 helping and 8 non- helping) were assigned to the control group. The research design selected for this study was reported by Campbell and Stanley (1963) as design 4 or the pretest-posttest control group design. A model for parental training was developed. The activities and the techniques employed in the model were derived from a number of motivational theories and from other models. The Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionaire (IAR) developed by Crandall (1965) was used to assess changes in motivation.\n","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

These ―disruptive‖ children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year: no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains: parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother–child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children. Even so, most treatment effects were specific to the school environment and did not affect achievement skills. These findings must be viewed as tentative until follow-up evaluations can be done to determine the long-term outcomes of these interventions.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The primary outcome will be the Woodcock Johnson test battery.\rFor effect size coding use Table 4 - Adjusted post test means and SDs for STC only versus No treatment group.

The goal is to work with students who do not fit within the framework of the school. The three-dimensional setting is four public secondary schools. Specifically, the paper asks questions. The first question deals with whether a group counseling approach can be utilized in working with students who demonstrate hostile \"acting out\" behavior. The paper is also addressed to the question as to whether a group counseling approach can be effective. Groups were to be formed at two junior and two senior high schools where a sufficient number of students could be identified to meet the criteria of the study (twelve control and twelve experimental students at each of the four schools). Experimental groups were to meet with the school psychologist and the guidance counselor twice each week for a period of eight weeks beginning with the first week of October. Each group counseling session was to last one class hour. It was found that there was no significant difference between the academic grade point average, conduct grade point average or suspensions between the experimental and control group. There was however a significant difference between the experimental and control group in number of absences at the .05 level and disciplinary infractions at the .01 level. The introduction of group counseling also did not significantly improve the academic grade point average or the conduct grade point average of the experimental group during and immediately after the period in which group-counseling took place. A significantly lower number of absences within the experimental group during the period in which counseling took place was found. The direction was in favor of the experimental group regarding a lower number of absences. Finally, the introduction of group counseling did not produce a significant lessening of suspensions and disciplinary action by the experimental group during the period of time in which counseling took place. Results and future implications are discussed. ","Comments":"This study reports multiple assessement periods. \rPlease focus on recording data for O2 (first six weeks mark period prior to counseling) and O3 (second mark period).","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Bestland D E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bestland D E (1967) A controlled experiment utilizing group counselling in four secondary schools in the Milwaukee public schools. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406861,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":372131,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 58:\n[¬s]\"Data analysis for this research involved utilizing analysis of covariance\n(ANCOVA)- an analysis that looked for similarity of groups being compared.

Group counseling programs have demonstrated social, emotional, and academic improvements for students who struggle academically. However, research in this area has been insufficient, particularly at the middle school level. A social constructivist counseling approach to group therapy was theorized to be a powerful tool in working with middle school students who read below grade level because it recognizes each student's unique reality and utilizes social learning through peer interaction. This research study focused on 162 students in a suburban Midwest school in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades. A pre-test post-test control group experimental design with stratified random sampling was utilized, and data was analyzed through Analysis of Covariance. The social constructivist counseling program was implemented for eight weeks with the treatment groups on each grade level during the third quarter of the school year. Dependent variables included student grade point averages, reading test scores, attendance, homework completion, a self-esteem scale, and a behavior evaluation scale. Of these six dependent variables, statistically significant results were found between the treatment and control groups in four areas, namely homework completion, reading test scores, a behavior scale, and self-esteem. While significant results were not found in the area of grade point averages, the treatment group did improve their grades. Demographic information of student grades, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status, and reading class placement was tested by ANOVA and ANCOVA to determine if grade level data could be combined and if demographic variables were significant between groups. These results were not significant. This research presented the opportunity to explore an area of school counseling that has received insufficient empirical research. The results warrant follow-up research on this specific group of students to determine longitudinal effects. This research calls for further research in assisting underserved populations, practices with middle school guidance programs, and social constructivist counseling.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The project had the students participate in a 30 week treatment program in a group setting at school. The children were randomly assigned to either the experimental or placebo control group. A variety of data were collected prior to treatment, immediately post-treatment and then the youngsters were followed up 18 months later. Archival data such as the number of discipline referrals, the number of in-school and out-of-school suspensions, grade point average, attendance information, and school tardies were collected. In addition, standardized measures to assess social competency, social problem solving skills, and self-concept were collected. Analysis of the data revealed that there are no statistically significant differences on any of the dependent variables immediately after treatment or 18 months later. The outcomes of this research does not support the use of pull out social problem-solving intervention with middle school age youngsters with disruptive behavior.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Burcham B G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Burcham B G (2002) Impact of school -based social problem -solving training on middle school students with disruptive behavior. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":375322,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"om !5 sch[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Camp_1977.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":375322,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"om !5 sch[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Camp_1977.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"15","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407118,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":375322,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"a.

It involved modeling and verbalization of cognitive activity to foster use of verbal mediation skills in dealing with both cognitive and interpersonal problems. It was hypothesized that this training would lead to improvement in test performance and teacher ratings of classroom behavior in hyperaggressive boys. Twelve aggressive second grade boys participated in daily, 30-minute, individual sessions for 6 weeks. Normal and aggressive control subjects received no intervention. Teachers rated both trained and untrained aggressive boys as improving in aggressive behaviors but they rated the experimental group as showing improvement on a sigmficantly larger number of prosocial behaviors. The pattern of performance on cognitive tests also changed significantly in the experimental group. On pretest, their pattern differed from normals and resembled the aggressive control group, while on posttest their pattern resembled normals and differed from aggressive controls. Suggestions were made concerning additional refinements needed in the program, but overall results indicated potential value in the present approach for providing assistance to aggressive boys in the early grades.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Camp Bonnie W; Blom Gaston E; Hebert Frederick ; van Doorninck  ; Willian J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00913091","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Camp Bonnie W, Blom Gaston E, Hebert Frederick, van Doorninck , and Willian J (1977) “Think Aloud”: A program for developing self-control in young aggressive boys.

socially rejected, low-achieving children were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 clinical intervention conditions: academic skills training (AST), social skills training (SST), combination (AST & SST), & control. Social rejection was defined by low social preference scores on positive & negative sociometric items. Low achievement was defined by lower than 36th percentile standing on the Calif Achievement Tests in reading or mathematics. Achievement & sociometric scores were obtained at the end of third grade (preintervention), fourth grade (postintervention), & fifth grade (follow-up). Classroom observations were made before & after intervention. The 2 X 2 (AST X SST) analyses of covariance revealed that AST produced significant improvement in reading, math, & social preference scores. All but the math progress was sustained at the time of follow-up. SST only resulted in significant reading comprehension progress. The AST groups showed significantly reduced off-task behavior & more on-task behavior. The AST groups tended to become less disruptive. They also experienced increases in positive teacher attention. The advantages of focusing on academic competency for this subset of rejected children are discussed in terms of the behavior changes, the enduring quality of the change, & models of interaction between academic & social effectiveness. 3 Tables, 32 References.

Jefferson Middle School in Oceanside, California, offered an academic program called the Jefferson Academy for Student Success and Intervention (JASSI). The program focused on students who had shown an inability to function in a traditional classroom setting. The goal of JASSI was to keep at-risk students in school, on the regular campus, by supporting them through an alternative approach to the curriculum and giving them counseling support that focused on non-school and school-related issues. The problem. Although JASSI was available to students in grades 6 through 8, the purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in California Standards Test (CST) mathematics and reading/language arts scores of eighth-grade students enrolled in JASSI and eighth-grade students at other middle schools in the school district with similar academic and demographic backgrounds. Method. An independent samples t test was conducted to determine whether a significant difference existed in growth in mathematics and reading/language arts CST scores between the two groups of students. Results. The first hypothesis, which predicted a significant difference in the growth in mathematic scores on the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 CST, was not supported. The null hypothesis, which predicted no significant difference between the two groups, was supported. The second hypothesis, which predicted a significant difference in the growth in reading/language arts scores on the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 CST, was not supported. The null hypothesis, which predicted no significant difference between the two groups, was supported. Although there were no significant differences in the CST growth scores in mathematics between those enrolled in the JASSI program and those not enrolled in the program, the average mean growth scores between the two sets of students were numerically different, with a higher growth score among students enrolled in the JASSI program. The lack of statistical difference may be attributed to the small sample size used for the comparison.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

As a basic step toward self-control. PATHS teaches young children to recognize the internal and external cues of affect and to label them with appropriate terms. In a series of lessons, “feeling” words are identified, along with descriptions of the sorts of situations that may elicit the feeling, descrip­ tions of the external cues to recognize that feeling in others, and the internal cues to identify that feeling in oneself. Additional lessons help children understand the difference between feelings and behaviors. Appropriate and inappropriate behavioral responses arc discussed. \"\n\" Another 30% of the lessons focus on skills related to the increase of positive social behavior (e.g., social participation, prosocial behavior, and communication skills). Lessons address making and sustaining friendships, using good manners, taking turns and sharing in games, expressing one's viewpoint, and listening to others, in addition, positive behaviors are elicited and reinforced during each lesson.\"\n\"Finally, about 30% of the lessons focus on self-control and other steps in social problem solving. The development of self-control, affective awareness and communication, and beginning problem-solving skills are integrated with the introduction of the Control Signals Poster (CSP). The CSP is designed like a traffic signal and is a modified version of the Stop Light used in the Yale-New Haven Middle-School Social Problem Solving Program (Weissberg. Caplan, & Bennetto, 1988). The CSP has a red light to signal \"Stop—Calm Down,” a yellow light for \"Go Slow—Think.\" a green light to signal \"Go—Try My Plan,” and at the bottom the words \"Evaluate—How Did My Plan Work?\"\"\n\"Typically, skill concepts are presented through direct instruction, dis­ cussion, modeling stories, or video presentations. Discussion and role­ playing activities follow, giving children a chance to practice the skill and teachers a chance to monitor the level of understanding and skill attained by each class. Although a standard script describes each lesson, teachers are encouraged to adjust the level of presentation and amount of practice as dictated by the responsivity and developmental level of each class.\"\n\"Although the lessons form an important part of the PATHS program, teachers arc also encouraged to generalize their use of PATHS concepts across the school day and to other settings of the school outside the classroom\"\n\"To generalize concepts to the home situation, the curriculum includes frequent parent updates on curriculum content and suggestions for ways parents can promote their children's growing competence. Regular home­ work activities are designed to help children engage their parents in cooperative activities, such as completing drawings or sharing stories related to curriculum components.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group_1999_OCR.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":413243,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"This study examined the effectiveness of the universal component of the Fast Track prevention model: the PATHS (Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies) curriculum and teacher consultation.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group_1999_OCR.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":413243,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" The PATHS preventive intervention program is based on the ABCD (Affective-Behavioral-Cognitive-Dynamic) model of development \"\n\" which places primary importance on the devel­ opmental integration of affect (and emotion language), behavior, and cognitive understanding as they relate to social and emotional competence.

This randomized clinical trial involved 198 intervention and 180 comparison classrooms from neighborhoods with greater than average crime in 4 U.S. locations. In the intervention schools, Grade 1 teachers delivered a 57-lesson social competence intervention focused on self-control, emotional awareness, peer relations, and problem solving. Findings indicated significant effects on peer ratings of aggression and hyperactive-disruptive behavior and observer ratings of classroom atmosphere. Quality of implementation predicted variation in assessments of classroom functioning. The results are discussed in terms of both the efficacy of universal, school-based prevention models and the need to examine comprehensive, multiyear programs.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Over 9,000 kindergarten children at 4 sites in 3 cohorts were screened, and 891 were identified as high risk and then randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Beginning in Grade 1, high-risk children and their parents were asked to participate in a combination of social skills and anger-control training, academic tutoring, parent training, and home visiting. A multiyear universal classroom program was delivered to the core schools attended by these high-risk children. By the end of third grade, 37% of the intervention group was determined to be free of serious conduct-problem dysfunction, in contrast with 27% of the control group. Teacher ratings of conduct problems and official records of use of special education resources gave modest effect-size evidence that the intervention was preventing conduct problem behavior at school. Parent ratings provided additional support for prevention of conduct problems at home. Parenting behavior and children's social cognitive skills that had previously emerged as proximal outcomes at the end of the 1st year of intervention continued to show positive effects of the intervention at the end of third grade.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group; Bierman K L; Coie J D; Dodge K A; Greenberg M T; Lochman J E; McMahon R J; Pinderhughes E E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014274914287","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Conduct Problems Prevention Research Group, Bierman K L, Coie J D, Dodge K A, Greenberg M T, Lochman J E, McMahon R J, and Pinderhughes E E (2002) Evaluation of the first 3 years of the fast track prevention trial with children at high risk for adolescent conduct problems.

These variables were self-concept, reading, mathematics, truancy, dean referrals, and school suspensions. In addition, this study sought to determine and compare the means of juvenile subjects in the experimental and control groups with respect to the dependent variables. Moreover, this investigation sought to determine whether any significant interrelationships existed among the responses of subjects for each of the intervention strategy groups and a control group with respect to the dependent variables. The subjects of this study comprised 480 junior high school students, of whom 120 were in each of the intervention strategy groups and the control group. The instruments employed in this study were the Juvenile Data Collection Form, used for recording the data obtained on the dependent variables; an Intake-Termination Form, utilized to screen the subjects; the Piers and Harris Children's Self Concept Scale, used for measuring self-concept; and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, employed for measuring academic achievement in reading and mathematics. The following major conclusions appeared warranted on the basis of the responses in this investigation: (1) It was concluded that the peer-group conflict management and the individual conflict resolution experimental groups were significant approaches in improving self-concept. (2) It was concluded that subjects in the family mediation experimental group achieved better in reading and mathematics than those in the peer-group conflict management experimental group. (3) It was concluded that all the experimental groups were effective in reducing truancy. (4) It was concluded that the peer-group conflict management and the individual conflict resolution experimental groups were effective in decreasing dean referrals. (5) It was further concluded that the peer group conflict management experimental group was the most effective intervention strategy in decreasing school suspensions.","Comments":"This study has 3 experimental groups.

The objective of this strategy was to assist the participants in exploring the causes and possible consequences of their behaviors.

These variables were self-concept, reading, mathematics, truancy, dean referrals, and school suspensions. In addition, this study sought to determine and compare the means of juvenile subjects in the experimental and control groups with respect to the dependent variables. Moreover, this investigation sought to determine whether any significant interrelationships existed among the responses of subjects for each of the intervention strategy groups and a control group with respect to the dependent variables. The subjects of this study comprised 480 junior high school students, of whom 120 were in each of the intervention strategy groups and the control group. The instruments employed in this study were the Juvenile Data Collection Form, used for recording the data obtained on the dependent variables; an Intake-Termination Form, utilized to screen the subjects; the Piers and Harris Children's Self Concept Scale, used for measuring self-concept; and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, employed for measuring academic achievement in reading and mathematics. The following major conclusions appeared warranted on the basis of the responses in this investigation: (1) It was concluded that the peer-group conflict management and the individual conflict resolution experimental groups were significant approaches in improving self-concept. (2) It was concluded that subjects in the family mediation experimental group achieved better in reading and mathematics than those in the peer-group conflict management experimental group. (3) It was concluded that all the experimental groups were effective in reducing truancy. (4) It was concluded that the peer-group conflict management and the individual conflict resolution experimental groups were effective in decreasing dean referrals. (5) It was further concluded that the peer group conflict management experimental group was the most effective intervention strategy in decreasing school suspensions.","Comments":"This study has 3 experimental groups.

Research by Hartup and Coates (1967) and Protinsky (1974) disclosed the importance of peer groups in influencing the aforementioned developmental process. \rPeer-group conflict management as used in the program was reality-based and focused on typical developmental problems such as the relationships with parents and siblings, peers, and authority figures, in an informal atmosphere that provided the juvenile with an opportunity for personal and social interaction. The juveniles were also given the chance in this atmosphere to increase their self-understanding, and to appraise their own abilities and values. The interventionist was the groupleader in the evolutionary stage of this strategy. However, as the group progressed and the juveniles were oriented in group-dynamic skills, leaders from within the group emerged. Initially, the group moved through a series of learning processes in order to make the members familiar with one another. Included in the process were norm and trust exercises.

These variables were self-concept, reading, mathematics, truancy, dean referrals, and school suspensions. In addition, this study sought to determine and compare the means of juvenile subjects in the experimental and control groups with respect to the dependent variables. Moreover, this investigation sought to determine whether any significant interrelationships existed among the responses of subjects for each of the intervention strategy groups and a control group with respect to the dependent variables. The subjects of this study comprised 480 junior high school students, of whom 120 were in each of the intervention strategy groups and the control group. The instruments employed in this study were the Juvenile Data Collection Form, used for recording the data obtained on the dependent variables; an Intake-Termination Form, utilized to screen the subjects; the Piers and Harris Children's Self Concept Scale, used for measuring self-concept; and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, employed for measuring academic achievement in reading and mathematics. The following major conclusions appeared warranted on the basis of the responses in this investigation: (1) It was concluded that the peer-group conflict management and the individual conflict resolution experimental groups were significant approaches in improving self-concept. (2) It was concluded that subjects in the family mediation experimental group achieved better in reading and mathematics than those in the peer-group conflict management experimental group. (3) It was concluded that all the experimental groups were effective in reducing truancy. (4) It was concluded that the peer-group conflict management and the individual conflict resolution experimental groups were effective in decreasing dean referrals. (5) It was further concluded that the peer group conflict management experimental group was the most effective intervention strategy in decreasing school suspensions.","Comments":"This study has 3 experimental groups.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly. Please code the mastery learning (ML) which has academic outcomes. Also code ML against external control for boys.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dolan L J; Kellam S G; Brown C H; Werthamer-Larsson L ; Rebok G W; Mayer L S; Laudolff J ; Turkkan J S; Ford C ; Wheeler L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1016/0193-3973(93)90013-L","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dolan L J, Kellam S G, Brown C H, Werthamer-Larsson L, Rebok G W, Mayer L S, Laudolff J, Turkkan J S, Ford C, and Wheeler L (1993) The short-term impact of two classroom-based preventive interventions on aggressive and shy behaviors and poor achievement.

The develop- ment of amore group-paced approach to mastery meant that students did not proceed to the next learning unit until the majority (80% achieving 80-85% of objectives) of students had fulfilled the learning objectives of the previous unit.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly. Please code the mastery learning (ML) which has academic outcomes. Also code ML against external control for girls.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dolan L J; Kellam S G; Brown C H; Werthamer-Larsson L ; Rebok G W; Mayer L S; Laudolff J ; Turkkan J S; Ford C ; Wheeler L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1016/0193-3973(93)90013-L","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dolan L J, Kellam S G, Brown C H, Werthamer-Larsson L, Rebok G W, Mayer L S, Laudolff J, Turkkan J S, Ford C, and Wheeler L (1993) The short-term impact of two classroom-based preventive interventions on aggressive and shy behaviors and poor achievement.

effectiveness of a group counseling program designed to teach elementary schoolchildren to make positive changes in their own behavior. 37 6th-graders, previously identified by their teachers as classroom disruptive, were randomly assigned to an experimental behavioral change learning group or to a group of delayed treatment controls. The experimental Ss were exposed to 10 weekly 1-hr counselor-led group sessions stressing value clarification, problem identification, goal setting, behavior change, and contracting. Pre- and posttreatment comparisons on the Peabody Individual Achievement Test, school attendance records, and teacher observations showed that the experimental group made greater academic achievement gains, was absent from school less frequently, and experienced a higher rate of improvement in classroom behavior. Programs of this type have obvious potential and should be the subject of research replication.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Downing Charles J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Downing Charles J (1977) Teaching children behavior change techniques.

This article reports on results for the high-risk subsample of 1,500 children. Results from hierarchical linear modeling indicate that comprehensive interventions, if provided in early grades, can be effective for children in schools in settings with resources adequate to support learning and development, but some unintended effects can occur in schools in the most distressed communities when delivered too late in development.

This article reports on results for the high-risk subsample of 1,500 children. Results from hierarchical linear modeling indicate that comprehensive interventions, if provided in early grades, can be effective for children in schools in settings with resources adequate to support learning and development, but some unintended effects can occur in schools in the most distressed communities when delivered too late in development.

This article reports on results for the high-risk subsample of 1,500 children. Results from hierarchical linear modeling indicate that comprehensive interventions, if provided in early grades, can be effective for children in schools in settings with resources adequate to support learning and development, but some unintended effects can occur in schools in the most distressed communities when delivered too late in development.

This development and evaluation work took place in one school in Twin Falls, Idaho, and involved a comparable control school.

paper reports on the effectiveness of an integrated comprehensive school model for character development, problem behavior prevention, and academic achievement enhancement. The Positive Action program consists of a school curriculum, together with schoolwide climate, family, and community components. As evaluated here, the yearly K-6 curriculum consists of over 140 fifteen-to-twenty-minute lessons per year delivered in school classrooms on an almost daily basis. The program is based on theories of self-concept, learning, behavior, and school ecology. We use a matched control design and school-level achievement and disciplinary data to evaluate program effects on student performance and behavior in two separate school districts. The program improved achievement by 16% in one district and 52% in another, and reduced disciplinary referrals by 78% in one district and 85% in the other. We discuss implications of these replicated findings for the prevention of substance abuse and violence, the improvement of school performance, and the reform of American schools. © 2001 Society for Prevention Research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Flay B R; Allred C G; Ordway N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1011591613728","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Flay B R, Allred C G, and Ordway N (2001) Effects of the positive action program on achievement and discipline: Two matched-control comparisons.

Anger Management - Manners - Empathy) to determine if it could effectively mediate a reduction in school violence by juvenile offenders at Kingsbury High School in Memphis, Tennessee. Independent variables of Grade Point Average, School Attendance, and School Disciplinary Actions were examined. This study postulated that the intervention GAME could teach behavioral skills, cognitive skills, and social skills to high school students that have a history of using violence. This study identified 72 high school students with a history of school violence and randomly assigned them into either a treatment group or a control group. The treatment group received the clinical intervention, GAME, a curriculum driven, and goal-based, group intervention that was implemented in eight meetings over four weeks. The school counselor was used as the facilitator. The control group received no intervention other than standard school operating school procedures for students with a history of school violence. Subject's data of Grade Point Average, School Attendance, and School Disciplinary Actions were collected for three months prior to the intervention and again three months after the intervention was complete. Outcome measures were evaluated using a repeated measure 2 x 2 ANOVA. No interaction effects were found. No statistically significant main effects were found. However, trends between group means were found that suggested that the clinical intervention GAME improved School Attendance and reduced School Disciplinary Actions.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The reported results span 4 program years of the Preparation through Responsive Educational Programs (PREP) project in three different junior high school sites. Measures of student grades showed positive generalization in five of nine instances. Negative transfer effects were not observed. It is not possible to determine the specific controlling variables since the program procedures and student characteristics varied across years and sites. However, the magnitude of the effect was found to be directly related to the magnitude of change in the treatment setting itself.","Comments":"This study includes 4 program years.

The student had the list of attending behaviors in front of him/her for reference (see Appendix C ) . The self-recording occurred during independent work periods in mathematics in the resource room by using a graph (Goldstein & Goldstein, 1986). At the cue given by the trainer, the student marked a + for on-task behavior and a - for off-task behavior according to the target behavior that was defined in step one. If the student was engaged in one of the behaviors during the independent work period, he/she was paying attention. The self-recording took place during the second through sixth sessions. At the fourth session, the intervals were ten minutes apart; at the fifth session, the intervals were after two problems had been completed.

This model was designed to help students change hyperactive and attentional behavior in the service of improving academic achievement and classroom performance. The dependent variables were mathematics report card grades, the arithmetic subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), conduct behavior, hyperactive behavior, inattentive/passive behavior, and a hyperactivity index. The effects of training on achievement and behavior were observed in the special education resource room setting and in the mainstreamed mathematics classes. Results of the Connors Teachers Rating Scale-Short Form were used to determine the presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders among the special education learning disabled students in grades seven through eleven in a suburban public school district on Long Island. The raters were the special education teachers and the regular education mathematics teachers. All students were mainstreamed in regular education mathematics. Twenty-eight seventh through eleventh grade students participated in the study. Fourteen students were assigned to a treatment group and fourteen to a control group. The study was conducted in the natural school setting, during the regular hours of the school day. Cognitive training took place in the special education resource room. Training included self-recording, self-verbalization and attribution training. Self-recording involved the students in recording their hyperactive and attentional behavior during training sessions in the resource room and then in the mainstream mathematics classes. Training in self-verbalization led to internalizing self-directed statements during problem solving situations. Attribution training was designed to help the student understand the reasons for success and failure on mathematics assignments and tests. An Analysis of Covariance was calculated on each of the past-treatment variables. Results showed better treatment than control group scores in hyperactive and attentional behavior in the special education resource room setting and higher treatment than control group mathematics report card grades. No significant posttreatment difference was found between treatment and control groups in the behavior in mainstream mathematics classes or on the WRAT arithmetic raw scores.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Friedman Ed D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Friedman Ed D (1992) An evaluation o f the integrated cognitive-behavioral model for improving mathematics performance and attentional behavior of adolescents with learning disabilities and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":374500,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Students in counselling model # 1 were from schools A and B[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen (1984).pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":451383,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Students in counselling model # 1 were from schools A and B[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen_1984_WS_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":374500,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The control group\nconsisting of students from the remaining two schools received no special\ncounselling[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen (1984).pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":451383,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The control group\nconsisting of students from the remaining two schools[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen_1984_WS_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"Not provided","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407109,"AdditionalText":"12","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":451383,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"(n = 12[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen_1984_WS_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":374500,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The control group\nconsisting of students from the remaining two schools received no special\ncounselling (n = 12)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen (1984).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407108,"AdditionalText":"16","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":451383,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"(n = 16)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen_1984_WS_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":374500,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Students in counselling model # 1 were from schools A and B (n = 16)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen (1984).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"4","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":451383,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The control group\nconsisting of students from the remaining two schools[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen_1984_WS_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":451383,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"Means and standard deviations on pretests and posttests for dependent measures for treat­\nment and control groups[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen_1984_WS_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":451383,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"From\nthis pool of 140 teacher-identified subjects, 56 students (46 males, 10 females) in\ngrades 4, 5 and 6 were selected by employing the Walker Problem Behavior Iden­\ntification Checklist (WPBIC) (Walker, 1976) and the New Developmental\nReading Tests (Bond, Balow and Hoyt, 1968) Of these, 39 students were\ndesignated for the experimental groups and 17 for the control group[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Friesen_1984_WS_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406980,"AdditionalText":"16","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406985,"AdditionalText":"12","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407036,"AdditionalText":"The study has 3 treatment groups and the number of dropouts was presented as a total for all 3 groups.

investigation evaluated the outcomes of three models of counselling with students in the elementary school who were identified as having Learning and behavioral problems. It was hypothesized that model one, counselling with parents, teachers and students was the most effective: model two, counselling with teachers and parents was the next most effective and model three, coun selling with students only was the least effective. It was discovered after 5 months of counselling, that although the student reading scores of the combined counselling groups improved significantly in comparison to the control group, no statistically significant change occurred between the counselling models either on student reading or classroom behavior. Model one counselling, however, produced cooperative relationships between teachers, parents and students.","Comments":"This study reports outcomes for three counselling models.

It was hypothesized that model one, counselling with parents, teachers and students was the most effective: model two, counselling with teachers and parents was the next most effective and model three, coun selling with students only was the least effective. It was discovered after 5 months of counselling, that although the student reading scores of the combined counselling groups improved significantly in comparison to the control group, no statistically significant change occurred between the counselling models either on student reading or classroom behavior. Model one counselling, however, produced cooperative relationships between teachers, parents and students.","Comments":"MDE: This study reports outcomes for three counselling models.

It was hypothesized that model one, counselling with parents, teachers and students was the most effective: model two, counselling with teachers and parents was the next most effective and model three, coun selling with students only was the least effective. It was discovered after 5 months of counselling, that although the student reading scores of the combined counselling groups improved significantly in comparison to the control group, no statistically significant change occurred between the counselling models either on student reading or classroom behavior. Model one counselling, however, produced cooperative relationships between teachers, parents and students.","Comments":"MDE: This study reports outcomes for three counselling models.

This study examined the effects of a friendly and cooperative game program on child development in children ages 6 and 7. A pretest/intervention/posttest design was used with a sample of 125 experimental and 53 control subjects. Social behavior in the classroom, self-concept, and academic learning maturity were measured. Treatment consisted of 22 play sessions carried out over one academic year. The program's games encourage children to cooperate and share, as well as to develop symbolic play. Results of variance analyses suggest that the intervention stimulated significant improvement in social behavior in the classroom (increasing behaviors of leadership, cheerfulness, sensitivity, and respect, and decreasing aggressiveness, apathy and anxiety), and in some aptitudes for academic learning (verbal and numerical skills). Although self-concept scores also increased, this change was not significant.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Garaigordobil Maite ; Echebarría Agustín ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02568549509594688","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Garaigordobil Maite, and Echebarría Agustín (1995) Assessment of a Peer-Helping Game Program on Children's Development.

Completion of the task enabled the child to earn one or two chi ps depending on the accuracy of his work. A bonus of two poker chips was al­ lotted for task completion before a timing bell sounded ending each 15 minute work segment. The pupil worked for three 15 minute work segments in each 60 minute period. A fourth, optional, free time seg­ ment was used so that the pupil could either \"buy into\" an activity corner (games, phonograph and records, comic and library books, magazines, tape recorder, etc.) or continue working in order to achieve extra points for other reinforcers. Thus, a maxi­ mum of either 21 or 28 chips could be earned each period depending on the child's performance on any given day. At the end of his last work section, the pupil would count his chips, report the total to the resource room teacher, and enter his chip total on a personal graph. The teacher would exchange 10 chips for a card which could then be spent immedi­ ately or saved for a higher valued item.

Resource Room Project represents an attempt to develop, refine, and evaluate an alternative to special class placement for behavior problem children in the public school. Children in the experimental group were scheduled for a resource room program during those periods of the day in which they were functioning least effectively in the regular class. Since the majority were also performing below expected grade level academically, the program emphasized academic remediation with the use of response-reinforcement contingencies in a structured classroom situation. The experimental group made significantly greater gains in reading vocabulary and arithmetic fundamentals than did a comparison group. Behavioral changes also occurred, with the greatest improvement being noted with the experimental group when in the resource room.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Glavin John P; Quay Herbert C; Annesley Frederick R; Werry John S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/001440297103800205","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Glavin John P, Quay Herbert C, Annesley Frederick R, and Werry John S (1971) An Experimental Resource Room for Behavior Problem Children.

The study hypothesized that training youngsters' parents and teachers in Meichenbaum verbal self-regulation procedures would be more effective than training only children in such procedures. Training consisted of 8 sessions over 4 weeks. The youngsters' cognitive and intellectual performance, academic achievement, classroom behavior, and home behavior were dependent variables. The most consistent gains for the experimental groups, compared with untreated controls, were in academic achievement, especially reading. Only slight improvement occurred in cognitive and intellectual abilities, except for the Matching Familiar Figures Test. No classroom behavior changes were reported, but participating parents perceived gains in home behavior. Implications for future research on verbal self-instruction are explored.","Comments":"This study has 4 experimental groups; PT (parents & teachers), T (teachers), P (parents), CH (children) + control group.

The study hypothesized that training youngsters' parents and teachers in Meichenbaum verbal self-regulation procedures would be more effective than training only children in such procedures. Training consisted of 8 sessions over 4 weeks. The youngsters' cognitive and intellectual performance, academic achievement, classroom behavior, and home behavior were dependent variables. The most consistent gains for the experimental groups, compared with untreated controls, were in academic achievement, especially reading. Only slight improvement occurred in cognitive and intellectual abilities, except for the Matching Familiar Figures Test. No classroom behavior changes were reported, but participating parents perceived gains in home behavior. Implications for future research on verbal self-instruction are explored.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 4 experimental groups; PT (parents & teachers), T (teachers), P (parents), CH (children) + control group.

impulsive fifth and sixth graders participated in a project to help them become more reflective problem solvers. The study hypothesized that training youngsters' parents and teachers in Meichenbaum verbal self-regulation procedures would be more effective than training only children in such procedures. Training consisted of 8 sessions over 4 weeks. The youngsters' cognitive and intellectual performance, academic achievement, classroom behavior, and home behavior were dependent variables. The most consistent gains for the experimental groups, compared with untreated controls, were in academic achievement, especially reading. Only slight improvement occurred in cognitive and intellectual abilities, except for the Matching Familiar Figures Test. No classroom behavior changes were reported, but participating parents perceived gains in home behavior. Implications for future research on verbal self-instruction are explored.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 4 experimental groups; PT (parents & teachers), T (teachers), P (parents), CH (children) + control group.

The study hypothesized that training youngsters' parents and teachers in Meichenbaum verbal self-regulation procedures would be more effective than training only children in such procedures. Training consisted of 8 sessions over 4 weeks. The youngsters' cognitive and intellectual performance, academic achievement, classroom behavior, and home behavior were dependent variables. The most consistent gains for the experimental groups, compared with untreated controls, were in academic achievement, especially reading. Only slight improvement occurred in cognitive and intellectual abilities, except for the Matching Familiar Figures Test. No classroom behavior changes were reported, but participating parents perceived gains in home behavior. Implications for future research on verbal self-instruction are explored.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 4 experimental groups; PT (parents & teachers), T (teachers), P (parents), CH (children) + control group.

Black middle school students' academic achievement. Mentoring has received considerable attention as a novel remedy. Although anecdotal evidence supports the positive role of mentoring on academic achievement, these results are not consistent, the Benjamin E. Mays Institute (BEMI) builds on the ideals of mentoring to counter the effects of academic underachievement among adolescent Black males by building a model that is Afrocentric; uses prosocial modeling; and emphasizes cultural strengths and pride,' and single-sex instruction in a dual-sex educational environment. From a sample of sixty-one middle school Black males, results revealed that students in the BEMI program had significantly greater academic attachment scores and academic success than their non-mentored peers. Additionally, racial identity attitudes of immersion/emersion and internalization and identification with academics were also significantly associated with standardized achievement tests and GPA. Policy and practice implications are discussed. © The Journal of Negro Education 2009.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code Reading as primary outcome (8th Grade Reading CMT) and then GPA and Mathematics (8th Grade CMT).","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gordon D M; Iwamoto D K; Ward N ; Potts R ; Boyd E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gordon D M, Iwamoto D K, Ward N, Potts R, and Boyd E (2009) Mentoring urban black middle school male students: Implications for academic achievement.

An evaluation of the PATHE program was conducted which compared PATHE schools to two non-PATHE schools. Year-to-year differences in the PATHE school averages on measures of the project goals were also examined. The results suggest that the direct student services implemented did not reduce delinquent behavior, but did increase commitment to education as indicated by dropout, retention, and graduation rates, and by standardized achievement test scores. The program was found to have been effective in improving school climate. Students in the program schools grew more attached to their schools and perceived an increase in both the fairness of school rules and the extent to which their schools were characterized by planning and action. Students also developed more positive self-concepts, reported more belief in rules, had fewer suspensions, had lower levels of alienation, and reported their schools to be safer. The evidence supports the conclusion that the program represents an effective model for reducing several risk factors for delinquent behavior for the school population as a whole, and for increasing educational outcomes for high-risk individuals.

The program involved school staff, students, and community members in planning and implementing a comprehensive school improvement effort; changed disciplinary procedures; and enhanced the school program with activities aimed at increasing achievement and creating a more positive school climate. It also provided services to marginal students designed to increase their self-concepts and success experiences and to strengthen their bonds to the school. The program brought about a small but measurable reduction in delinquent behavior and misconduct. Students in participating schools were suspended less often, reported fewer punishing experiences in school, and reported less involvement in delinquent and drug-related activities. The environmental interventions apparently decreased delinquency and misconduct by promoting a sense of belonging in and attachment to the school and by improving the general climate and disciplinary practices in the school adn by improving the general climate and disciplinary practices in the schools. The direct interventions with high-risk students did not reduce delinquent behavior, but did increase commitment to education as indicated by rates of dropout, retention, graduation, and standardized achievement test scores. The evidence supports the conclusion that the program has promise for reducing delinquency and its risk factors for the general population and for improving educational outcomes for high-risk individuals.

Implementation measures showed that 68% of intended instruction was delivered in the first realization. Self-report measures showed improved school conduct, less victimization in school, and more positive peer associations for the treatment group than for the comparison group at the end of the school year. Treatment students were less likely to leave the school than were comparison students, but were more often absent and tardy. Implementation was poorer in the second realization, and there were no treatment-comparison differences on self-reports or teacher ratings, but treatment students less often left the school. Difficulties in conducting instruction in difficult settings may limit the effectiveness of otherwise efficacious interventions. Specific intervention programs may offer minimal benefits if more basic school improvements are not achieved. © 2002 Society for Prevention Research.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gottfredson G D; Jones E M; Gore T W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014671310038","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gottfredson G D, Jones E M, and Gore T W (2002) Implementation and evaluation of a cognitive-behavioral intervention to prevent problem behavior in a disorganized school.

Sixteen schools were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) no-treatment control, (b) general enhancement classroom program, (c) general enhancement plus small-group peer-skills training, or (d) general enhancement plus small-group peer-skills training plus family intervention. This article reports on results for the high-risk subsample of 1,500 children. Results from hierarchical linear modeling indicate that comprehensive interventions, if provided in early grades, can be effective for children in schools in settings with resources adequate to support learning and development, but some unintended effects can occur in schools in the most distressed communities when delivered too late in development.","Comments":"MDE: Study has 4 conditions.

Proactive classroom management, interactive teaching, and cooperative learning methods were included. Low achievers in experimental classrooms showed more favorable attitudes toward math, more bonding to school, greater expectations for continuing schooling, and less serious misbehavior as measured by suspensions and expulsions from school than did their low-achieving control counterparts at the end of one academic year. Among low achievers, significant effects of the teaching practices were not found for California Achievement Test scores or for self-reported delinquency or drug use. The results suggest that interventions in mainstream classrooms can promote school attachment and deter misbehavior among low-achieving students. The absence of short-term effects on standardized achievement scores suggests possible alternativ...","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Also studied were the effects of planned parental involvement in the affective education program. Five classrooms at each of two schools were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) affective education program, (b) affective education program with planned parental involvement, (c) control group. The students were pre- and posttested measuring: (a) self-esteem, (b) intellectual achievement responsibility (IAR), a locus of control measure, (c) alternative-thinking, (d) reading comprehension. To control for bias in regards to the self-esteem and IAR measures, the students were administered the Children's Social Desirability Questionnaire. Documentation was recorded by the researcher on (a) student fights, (b) teacher/student arguments, (c) self-initiated parent contacts, and (d) student self-referrals to the guidance counselor. Using the Toward Affective Development Program (TAD), treatment group I was involved in 23 weekly sessions, 30 minutes per session. In addition to TAD, treatment II involved newsletters and a reading seminar for parents of students. The treatment group with planned parental involvement demonstrated significantly higher gains on the self-esteem measure than control group (Group III). There were no significant differences noted between groups I and III, and I and II. Treatment groups I and II made significantly higher gains on the alternative-thinking measure than the control group. Treatment group II demonstrated the highest gain. There were no significant differences noted among the groups in intellectual achievement responsibility scores. Treatment group II reported significantly higher gains in reading achievement than the control group. There were no significant differences indicated between groups I, and II, and I and III. There were significant differences found in the percentages of fights and teacher/student arguments reported among the groups. The control group reported a higher percentage of student fights and teacher/student arguments than groups I and II. Treatment group I reported a higher percentage of student fights than treatment group II. Treatment group II reported a higher percentage of teacher/student arguments than treatment group I. There were no significant differences noted among the groups in the percentages of student self-referrals and parent contacts to the guidance counselor. The use of affective education in conjunction with parental participation warrants further investigation.","Comments":"There are 3 groups; affective education, affective education with parental involvement and control group.

and Method of Study. Recent research has indicated that impulsive children display academic and behavior problems resulting from the inefficient use of cognitive styles. The literature also suggests that impulsive cognitive style may be modified through verbal self-instruction. This study attempts to determine if such training based on daily school work could be carried on effectively by the child's teacher and could this instruction generalize to five cognitive styles; classroom behavior, impulsivity, field dependence, successive cognitive processing, and simultaneous cognitive processing. In order to test empirically these two concepts, students and teachers were randomly assigned to classes. Teachers from one class in each grade provided verbal self-instruction training to students classified as impulsive. The remainder of the classes served as the control group. The students were tested prior to and after the eight week treatment to determine the difference of each group on the five cognitive styles. Findings and Conclusions. The conclusion of the present study was that self-instruction training was only effective with the modification of self-control. Verbal self-instruction training did not generalize, and was not an effective technique for modifying field dependence, impulsivity, and simultaneous and successive cognitive processing. The result of this study and the equivocal results of previous verbal self-instruction training studies carried on in the classroom may indicate that classroom training by paraprofessionals and the use of academic materials may not be an effective means for altering these cognitive styles. The possibility remains that verbal self-instruction training as currently designed and implemented does not effect change, beyond self-control, as intended.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Hoover V L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hoover V L (1985) The effect of verbal self-instruction training on the cognitive styles of impulsive elementary school students. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406849,"AdditionalText":"Randomization of schools","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The study was designed as a randomized, wait-list control effectiveness trial with groups of schools[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"33","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"33 Treatment[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"30","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"30 Delay/Control schools[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407112,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"63","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"33 Treatment and 30 Delay/Control schools[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406859,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406861,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Table 1 Average Enrollment and Average Percentage of Students in Racial–Ethnic, Socioeconomic, and Instructional Categories at Time 1 by Condition[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406866,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Table 1 Average Enrollment and Average Percentage of Students in Racial–Ethnic, Socioeconomic, and Instructional Categories at Time 1 by Condition[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"Table 3\"\n\" T1[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407037,"AdditionalText":"6.06","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"n 33 31[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Horner etal_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407117,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373898,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\" The schools were selected based on (a) state capacity to provide whole-school, team-training in SWPBS; (b) self-nomination by school building admin- istrators; and (c) absence of prior direct training for school building personnel in SWPBS.

An effectiveness analysis was conducted with elementary schools in Hawaii and Illinois where training and technical assistance in SWPBS was provided by regular state personnel over a 3-year period. Results document that the training and technical assistance were functionally related to improved implementation of universal-level SWPBS practices. Improved use of SWPBS was functionally related to improvements in the perceived safety of the school setting and the proportion of third graders meeting or exceeding state reading assessment standards. Results also document that levels of office discipline referrals were comparatively low, but the absence of experimental control for this variable precludes inference about the impact of SWPBS. Implications for future research directions are offered.

It is a universal intervention and is therefore delivered to all children in a given class by their teacher. Over the course of implementation, it is intended that there is a natural progression in terms of the types of rewards given (from tangible rewards such as stickers to more abstract rewards such as free time), how long the game is played for (from 10 minutes to a whole lesson), at what frequency (from three times a week to every day), and when rewards are given (at the end of the game, the end of the day, and the end of the week). Teachers receive two days of initial training, with one day of follow-up training midway through the first year of implementation. On-going support for implementation is provided by trained GBG coaches employed by the delivery organisation, Mentor UK (who were in turn supported by the American Institutes for Research for this trial). We used a randomised controlled trial design in which 77 schools were randomly allocated to implement the GBG for two years (38 schools) or continue their normal practices (39 schools). The target cohort was pupils in Year 3 (aged 7-8) in the first year of implementation (N=3084). The project was designed as an efficacy trial. Alongside the assessment of outcomes, we undertook a comprehensive mixed- methods implementation and process evaluation involving observations, interviews and focus groups. Delivery started in September 2015 and concluded in July 2017.

The major criterion established for pupils who participated in the study was that they had been truant at least twelve school days during the 1971-72 school year. The subjects in both the experimental (n=54) and control groups (n=54) were measured prior to and after the exposure of the experimental group to the Juvenile Court Program. The study was designed to compare the results of both groups in the areas of attendance, academic achievement and classroom behaviour. The appropriate statistical models were applied to determine if the differences, if any, in the pre and post measurement means were significant. The main findings included significantly higher attendance of students exposed to the Juvenile court service project compared to the control students, no significant difference in the academic performance of pupils exposed to the Juvenile Court Program and pupils that did not receive the program and the classroom behaviour of the subjects involved in the Juvenile Court Program and pupils not exposed to the services of the program was not significantly different. Secondary analyses relating to gender and grades are also discussed.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting. The original pdf is a scanned file and too large to upload.

Fourteen students received group play therapy with a trained therapist in groups of two to four children and 13 children met informally in small groups with an adult who provided no therapeutic intervention. Thirteen children received no intervention and served as a control group. Children received group play therapy or placebo activities for ten half hour sessions. Curriculum based measures of reading and ratings of emotional symptoms by teacher, parent and self report were completed prior to and subsequent to intervention. Mixed analyses of variance revealed no significant differences in reading scores as a function of treatment condition. In addition, emotional symptoms per teacher and parent report did not differ significantly over time as a function of treatment. A trend toward decrement in self report of emotional symptoms and ratings of inadequacy over time occurred yet this was not attributed to treatment condition. In spite of theoretical benefits of using play therapy interventions with low achieving students, providing group play therapy did not account for significant differences in reading, or global emotional symptoms of remedial readers.","Comments":"Please code group play therapy vs. control.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Kaplewicz Noel Lanni; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education Psychology Emotional symptoms Group ther","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kaplewicz Noel Lanni (1999) Effects of group play therapy on reading achievement and emotional symptoms among remedial readers. , Alfred University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373954,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Twenty-seven non-self-controlled problem children (8 to 12 yrs. old) were ran-\ndomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral treatment, a behavioral treatment, or\nan attention-control condition.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kendall _ Braswell_1982.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407117,"AdditionalText":"randomised block procedures, using SCRS scores","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373954,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The 27 referred subjects were rank ordered according\nto SCRS scores and randomly assigned to the cognitive-\nbehavioral group, the behavioral group, and the atten-\ntion-control group using randomized block procedures.\nTeachers, testers, and observers were blind to group as-\nsignment.

The following provides a general description of the tasks (for details see Kendall, 1981, and the treatment manual). Sessions 1,2, and 3: Tasks requiring the child to select which would come next in a sequence and books from the Specific Skills series (Barnell-Loft, Ltd.; e.g., \"Fol- lowing Directions\" and \"Getting the Main Idea\") were employed. Tasks were geared to grade level. Sessions 4, 5, and 6: A calculator-type math toy pre- sented problems of increasing levels of difficulty. This toy can be used to play games appropriate for each grade level. Perceptual puzzles (Tangrams) were also used. Sessions 7 and 8: Playing checkers and a variation of checkers called \"Cat and Mouse\" were the tasks. Inter- personal play situations allowed the therapist to acquire more personal information about the child. Sessions 9 and 10: A series of pictures of children displaying different emotions were used to have the child identify the emotions and generate possible explanations for these feelings. The child was also presented with a series of pictures of interpersonal situations and asked to state how he or she would feel in such a situation and to think of possible solutions for each situation. Sessions 11 and 12: Role playing of problem solving in social situations was the focus. Hypothetical situations were recorded on notecards, and the therapist and child alternated selecting situations to be acted out. Also, there was role playing of situations that had been identified as problems for the child by his classroom teacher. To maximize the relevance of the role-playing sessions, the second author met with each teacher to discuss the spec- ific situations in which a given subject was most likely to demonstrate non-self-controlled behavior. This in- formation was then used to generate the role-playing situations for each child's therapist to employ. Through- out the intervention phase of the study, supervision time was set aside in which therapists could consult with the authors on any special problems or concerns that emerged during the course of the study. Cognitive-behavioral treatment. These subjects re- ceived training in verbal self-instructions via modeling, social reward for correct performance, response-cost pro- cedures contingent upon errors, and positive reinforce- ment for certain behaviors. Self-instructional training focused on teaching the children five steps in problem- solving: problem definition (i.e., clarifying and under- standing the exact requirements of the task), problem approach (i.e., planning a general strategy), focusing at- tention, selecting an answer, and self-reinforcing for cor-[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kendall _ Braswell_1982.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":373954,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"rect performance. Social reinforcement from the ther- apist also accompanied appropriate performance. If an error was made, the therapist labelled and explained the mistake while enacting a response cost. Subjects were taught to use coping statements (e.g., \"I'll do better next time if I remember to slow down\"). Self-instructions were initially worded in a concrete manner but were changed to a conceptual style to increase their general- izability (Kendall & Wilcox, 1980). Throughout the sessions therapists modeled self-in- structions. During task instruction the therapist per- formed the task out loud, verbalizing the steps and mod- eling the behaviors associated with successful task per- formance. The child and therapist then alternated on task performance. Gradually, the therapist faded self- instructions to a whisper and then to a completely covert event (determined by the therapist according to the child's ability). When an error occurred, the therapist reverted to overt self-instructionsand required the child to do likewise. Therapists also modeled the use of self- instructions informally with a number of naturally oc- curring events (e.g., looking for the therapy room, find- ing items in a briefcase, or setting up the task materials). Therapy tasks involved increasing the child's cogni- tive awareness of the feelings of others via exercises in the recognition and labeling of emotions and practice in the systematic generation and consideration of alter- natives for dealing with hypothetical and real-life prob- lems. The nature of these tasks required some variation in the application of modeling, rehearsal, fading, and so forth. Children were required to provide overt expla- nations and discussions of the use of problem definition, problem approach, selection of an alternative, and self- reinforcement strategies with interpersonal situations. To determine the \"correct\" response in such situations, the children were instructed to consider the behavioral and emotional consequences of each possible alterna- tive. Children were also encouraged to use the self-in- structional strategies in their classroom and home activ- ities. Behavioral contingencies were used. The child re- ceived 20 chips and was told that the chips could be used to buy a prize at the end of the sessions but that there were three ways to lose a chip: failing to use the self-instructional steps, going too fast, or giving the in- correct answer. Subjects were also told that there were two ways .to earn \"bonus chips\": remembering and re- telling an instance of using the self-instructional steps in the classroom or home and providing accurate self- evaluation. At the end of each session, the therapist showed the child a S-point rating scale, with 1 indicating \"not so hot\" and 5 indicating \"super extra-special.\" The therapist told the child that he or she would pick the number that best described the child's behavior during that session. The child picked a number also, and if the number equalled or was within one point of the thera- pist's number, the child earned a bonus chip. Each child was required to select only one prize from the reward menu. The child may spend all chips each session or buy a small prize and save the remaining chips to be added to the next sessions's earnings. Some prizes were expensive and required a \"savings plan.\" The re- ward menu contained items such as pencils, folders, and books (3 to 125 chips), Behavioral-treatment condition. Subjects were ex- posed to the same training materials (e.g., psychoedu- cational tasks, interpersonal play situations, and inter- personal problem-solving exercises). As with the cogni- tive-behavioral group, reward and response-cost contingencies were in operation, and the therapists mod- eled appropriate task behavior. The distinguishing fea- ture of this group was the lack of self-instructional train- ing and cognitive modeling in problem resolution. As a result, subjects in the behavioral group could lose a chip for going too fast or making a mistake but not for failing to. use the self-instructions. Also, behavioral- group members could earn \"bonus chips\" for accurate self-evalution but obviously could not earn chips for re- membering to use the self-instructions in the classroom or home setting. Attention-control condition. Subjects received 12 in- dividual sessions of comparable duration, similar ther- apy materials, and a credible rationale. The control con- dition included neither self-instructions, modeling, nor contingencies. Each session involved cooperative work on the therapy tasks. In the absence of contingencies, children received rewards for \"cooperation and effort.\" To control for the effects of the reward itself, each ther- apist yoked the control child to one of his or her treat- ment children on an alternating basis, givingthe control child whatever reward that treatment child had chosen in his or her most recent session,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kendall _ Braswell_1982.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215576,"AdditionalText":"Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (PH; Piers & Harris, 1969): self-esteem was measured using self-report\r\rMatching Familiar Figures Test (MFF; Kagan, 1966): reflectivity-impulsivity (p. 673) \r\rSelf-Control Rating Scale (SCRS; Kendall & Wilcox, 1979): self-control\r\rBehavioural observations: OTV, OTP, OTA, OS, BV, BP (Each pair was observed for 15 minutes, twice a week for 2 weeks, with the observer alternating between each pair member.)\r- There seems to be a second, matched control group (inside the classroom) created for observations in addition to the original random assignment for treatment for selected pupils with difficulties.\r\rHyperactivity scale (Conners, 1969)\r\rSession Summary Sheet: attention and interest","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":373954,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Behavior rating scales.

non-self-controlled problem children (8 to 12 yrs. old) were ran-domly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral treatment, a behavioral treatment, or an attention-control condition. All subjects received 12 sessions of individual therapist contact focusing on psychoeducational, play, and interpersonal tasks and situations, with the cognitive-behavioral treatment including self-instruc-tional training via modeling and behavioral contingencies and the behavioral treatment involving modeling and contingencies. The cognitive-behavioral in-tervention improved teachers' blind ratings of self-control, and both the cognitive-behavioral and behavioral treatments improved teachers' blind ratings of hyper-activity. Parent ratings did not show that treatment produced improvement. Several performance measures (cognitive style, academic achievement) showed improvements for the cognitive-behavioral and behavioral-conditions, whereas only the cognitive-behavioral treatment improved children's self-reported self-concept. Naturalistic observations in the classroom showed variability, but off-task verbal and off-task physical behaviors suggested treatment efficacy. Nor-mative comparisons and 10-week follow-up provided additional support for the efficacy of the cognitive-behavioral treatment, whereas 1-year follow-up data did not show significant differences across conditions. The data provide support for the inclusion of the cognitive component in the cognitive-behavioral intervention.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes three arms.

All subjects received 12 sessions of individual therapist contact focusing on psychoeducational, play, and interpersonal tasks and situations, with the cognitive-behavioral treatment including self-instruc-tional training via modeling and behavioral contingencies and the behavioral treatment involving modeling and contingencies. The cognitive-behavioral in-tervention improved teachers' blind ratings of self-control, and both the cognitive-behavioral and behavioral treatments improved teachers' blind ratings of hyper-activity. Parent ratings did not show that treatment produced improvement. Several performance measures (cognitive style, academic achievement) showed improvements for the cognitive-behavioral and behavioral-conditions, whereas only the cognitive-behavioral treatment improved children's self-reported self-concept. Naturalistic observations in the classroom showed variability, but off-task verbal and off-task physical behaviors suggested treatment efficacy. Nor-mative comparisons and 10-week follow-up provided additional support for the efficacy of the cognitive-behavioral treatment, whereas 1-year follow-up data did not show significant differences across conditions.

Advanced undergraduates majoring in psychology used interpersonal problem-solving techniques to work with 32 maladapting first through third graders who were seen on a small group basis. The intervention program was conducted for 14 weeks. Compared to a control group of 32 children, results indicated that children in the program made siginficantly greater gains in classroom adjustment as rated by teachers. Additionally, socimetric status served as a criterion for evaluating program effectiveness. Results demonstrated that children who participated in the social competence training made significantly greater gains in peer acceptance as measured by a brief sociometric questionnaire than the controls. The implications of these findings and the methodological limitations of the study are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mannarino Anthony P; Christy Monica ; Durlak Joseph A; Magnussen Max G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-4405(82)90036-X","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mannarino Anthony P, Christy Monica, Durlak Joseph A, and Magnussen Max G (1982) Evaluation of social competence training in the schools.

Teachers who were the group leaders of Reality Therapy participated in five workshops in December 1971 in preparation for therapy sessions which began in January 1972 and continued until the first of May. The pretesting was administered in December and posttesting in May. A summary of the data suggest that Reality Therapy or class meetings had a significant effect on the discipline of the experimental group. The variables self-concept, social adjustment and reading achievement indicated no significant differences between the control group and the experimental group.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Positive effects are found on improving student attendance and report card grades in English, but not on promotion rates or standardized test scores. The effects, though sizable, were not sufficient to neutralize the academic risks with which students entered the program. The positive results were primarily due to three of the seven sites. Some evidence supported interpretations that, although strong one-on-one mentoring is not an essential component of an effective program that uses outside adults to assist at-risk middle school students, the RAISE model is much more likely to show positive effects when one-on-one mentoring has been strongly implemented. Success may also depend on the size and composition of the student group to be served. Issues are raised about roles and responsibilities of adult advocates or mentors.","Comments":"Last updated - 2018-08-31 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 28ER5 96ER5 28 96; 227ER5 318ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 226 316 8016 4542; 717ER5 715; 1437ER5 252ER5 1431 251; 1918ER5 7641ER5 912ER5 1907 7615 909; 4740ER5 4723; 5642ER5 9453ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 5623 9419 10278 8016 4542; 5644ER5 9455ER5 9339ER5 5258ER5 5625 9421 9306 5241; 6566ER5 9050ER5 6775ER5 9687ER5 6603ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 6545 9017 6752 9651 6582 8016 4542; 6667ER5 9339ER5 5258ER5 6646 9306 5241; 8330ER5 8299; 9222ER5 1930ER5 8362ER5 9189 1919 8331; 10283ER5 28ER5 96ER5 10241 28 96; 10814ER5 10770; 11226ER5 9339ER5 5258ER5 11182 9306 5241; 11234ER5 11220ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 11704ER5 318ER5 11190 11176 8016 4542 11658 316; Maryland (Baltimore)","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McPartland James M; Nettles Saundra Murray; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1086/443998","Keywords":"Academic Achievement\nAdults\nAttendance\nChild Advocacy\nCommunity Involvement\nERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE\nHigh Risk Students\nJunior High School Students\nJunior High Schools\nMaryland (Baltimore)\nMentors\nMiddle Schools\nProgram Effectiveness\nSchool Community Programs\nStudent Promotion\nTest Results\nUrban Schools\nUrban Youth","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McPartland James M, and Nettles Saundra Murray (1991) Using Community Adults as Advocates or Mentors for At-Risk Middle School Students: A Two-Year Evaluation of Project RAISE.

To test the effectiveness of a middle school, multimedia health sciences educational program called HEADS UP in non-Asian-minority (Hispanic and African American), inner-city students. The program designers hope to increase the number of these students entering the health sciences pipeline. The program includes video role-model stories featuring minority scientists and students, hands-on activities, and teacher resources. Collaborators from The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Spring Branch Independent School District, and the Health Museum developed the modules. METHOD: From 2004 to 2007, the authors used a quasi-experimental, two-group pretest/posttest design to assess program effects on students' performance and interest in science, their science self-efficacy, their fear of science, and their science-related careers self-efficacy. An independent third party matched the intervention school to a comparison school by test scores, school demographics, and student demographics and then matched pairs of sixth-grade students (N = 428) by fifth-grade science scores, gender, ethnicity, and participation in the free or reduced lunch program. The authors collected data on these students for three years. RESULTS: At eighth grade (2007), the intervention school students scored significantly higher (F = 12.38, P < .001) on the Stanford Achievement Test 10 in science and reported higher interest in science (F = 11.08, P < .001) than their matched, comparison-school pairs. Students in neither group reported an increase in their confidence to choose a science-related career, but students in one high-implementing teacher's class reported decreased fear of science. CONCLUSIONS: HEADS UP shows potential for improving inner-city, non-Asian-minority middle school students' performance and interest in science. © 2009 Association of American Medical Colleges.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Murray N G; Opuni K A; Reininger B ; Sessions N ; Mowry M M; Hobbs M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181a425e7","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Murray N G, Opuni K A, Reininger B, Sessions N, Mowry M M, and Hobbs M (2009) A multimedia educational program that increases science achievement among inner-city non-Asian minority middle-school students.

The significance of this study lay in its intent to assess the outcomes of a semester-long intervention by collegiate mentors to effect a reduction in middle school violence by building self concept and improving academic success. Although there has been a substantial amount of literature documenting the linkages between violent behavior and self concept, and between self concept and academic success, there is little or no direct evidence that this destructive cycle can be broken through a mentoring program. This research addressed deficiencies in earlier studies by selecting the sample pool to include only students with parallel histories of violent behavior and a lack of academic success. Students in both the treatment and control groups were evaluated in terms of self-esteem through the use of the Bracken Multidimensional Self Concept Scale both before and after treatment. Student outcomes were monitored in the same terms used to select them for participation. The results were analyzed by performing a t-test for independent means in order to determine whether there were significant differences between the experimental and control groups with regard to grades, self concept, and violent behavior after the treatment. Where initial differences were found to have existed, analysis of covariance was utilized to control for these differences. A chi-square analysis was used to determine whether there was a significant difference before and after the study in terms of expulsions and exclusions. The study concluded that the mentored students in the experimental group showed significant increases in the dimensions of academic and total self concept. The mentored students also demonstrated a significant decline in violent incidents and exclusions. Changes in grades were not found to be significant. This study supported the idea that a low-cost mentoring program for middle school students is an effective method of raising self concept and reducing violent behavior.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The Think First curriculum was delivered to 84 Latino students in enrolled in the ninth and tenth grades at Saddleback High School in Santa Ana, California. The study evaluated the relationship between student age, gender, grade level, academic grade in one subject area, teacher perception of externalizing behavior, and student attitudes towards anger. Statistically significant differences between the control and experimental groups were found in student discipline records and grades after eight sessions of training spread over four weeks. The findings of this study extend previous research examining the effectiveness of anger management programs and curricula delivered in school settings.

Those exposed to problem-solving training improved on measures of alternative thinking and consequential thinking skills. The training, however, did not affect teacher ratings of student behavior or observed classroom behavioral functioning. In addition, the response cost procedure did not enhance acquisition or utilization of problem-solving skills. © 1984.","Comments":"Please code problem-solving versus control group.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Olexa D F; Forman S G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-4405(84)90036-0","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Olexa D F, and Forman S G (1984) Effects of social problem-solving training on classroom behavior of urban disadvantaged students.

The subjects came from Adelphi Elementary School in Prince George's County, Maryland. They were selected on the basis of teacher and principal Judgments regarding behavioral problems (mainly aggression, hyperactivity, poor peer relations, etc.). The subjects, who totalled 50 in number, were equally divided by randomized assignment into five different groups (ten subjects to a group): two experimental; three control groups— two Hawthorne groups (to control for the personality effects of the counselors as well as the \"attention\" factor) and an inactive control group. There were 20 counseling sessions held between the second and third grading terms. The experimental groups received Rogerian or nondirective counseling, whereas the Hawthorne control groups were read to and read themselves from a variety of preselected books. Two experienced counselors were responsible for the counseling. There were a number of findings. In addition, some serendipitous results were also investigated. The experimental subjects didn't improve on the measure of peer group acceptance. Unexpectedly, two of the three Gronlund categories yielded significance in favor of the control groups. Nonsignificant differences resulted between the experimental and control groups regarding changes in GPA, regarding changes in behavior on the Rating Scale for Pupil Adjustment, and regarding teachers estimates of \"improved-unimproved.\" Only one significant difference occurred between the groups on the Pupil Classroom Behavior Scale. Limitations of the study as well as recommendations for further research were discussed. Unfortunately, elementary group counseling with adjustment problem children did not prove to be helpful in alleviating their adjustment problems according to the measures which were adopted.

an intervention program on variables related to school performance in which ninth-grade high school students served as subjects. Variables that served as indicators of program effectiveness were (a) grade-point average (GPA); (b) proportions of students that attain 10th-grade status as measured by units of academic credit; (c) percent-correct scores on tests of academic skills in the areas of editing, mathematics, and reading; (d) rates of absence from classes; and (e) rates of referral for disciplinary action by teachers and administrators. Qualitative evidence of program effectiveness was secured through individual student interviews. The treatment consisted of an eight-week intervention program designed to assist all ninth-grade students in the transition from junior high school into high school. Program faculty presented six topics determined to be important to student success in high school. The treatment group consisted of 72 ninth-grade students who were matched with 72 control subjects on pretest measures of GPA and absence rate. Pretest measures of the dependent variables were taken from school records compiled during the first 10 weeks of the 9th-grade prior to student participation in the treatment program. Posttest measures of the dependent variables were taken from school records during the first full semester of the 9th-grade school year immediately following the treatment program and again during the first 12 weeks of the 10th-grade school year. Analyses of covariance demonstrated significant differences (p $<$.05) between the two groups for the first posttests of GPA and absence rates. Student interviews revealed that academic planning and improvement in study skills were the components of the treatment program that students considered most important to academic success. Results of this study provided empirical confirmation of the findings of previous research which indicated that high school intervention programs can positively affect GPA and attendance. The results also suggested that further gains in GPA and attendance might be promoted by increasing the length of the treatment program.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The results of the evaluation indicate that students' self-efficacy beliefs regarding problem solving were higher in the intervention group than in the comparison group; however, no significant differences in academic achievement were found.","Comments":"MainDE: Please focus on the Grade 7 group for this study as the Grade 8 outcome data is incomplete.\nESDE: Focus on the Grade 7 group for the data extraction, with Reading as the Primary outcome, maths and writing as secondary outcomes.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Poynton Timothy A; Carlson Matt W; Hopper James A; Carey John C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Academic achievement\nClassroom management\nEducation\nEffectiveness studies\nIntervention\nMiddle school students\nNorthwestern states\nSchool counseling","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Poynton Timothy A, Carlson Matt W, Hopper James A, and Carey John C (2006) Evaluation of an Innovative Approach to Improving Middle School Students' Academic Achievement.

is a report of the second year of research on an experimental resource room program for classroom behavior problem children. The program emphasized academic remediation utilizing behaviorally oriented principles. The modification of both social behavior when in the resource room and academic gains in reading and arithmetic were significant for the experimental subjects (N=69); however, attending behavior while in the regular classroom was not different from the controls (N=48). The implications of this intervention procedure for behavior problem children and for other exceptional children is discussed.","Comments":"Please code outcomes for \"schools combined\".","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Quay Herbert C; Glavin John P; Annesley Frederick R; Werry John S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-4405(72)90049-0","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Quay Herbert C, Glavin John P, Annesley Frederick R, and Werry John S (1972) The modification of problem behavior and academic achievement in a resource room.

model of preventive intervention is described which identified and significantly overcame school maladaptation among preschool children enrolled in a Detroit Public School Title I Program. Children were screened by teachers for learning and behavioral difficulties using the AML Scale, the Classroom Adjustment Rating Scale, and the Caldwell Preschool Inventory. Sixtyfour children were identified on the basis of these instruments as exhibiting some form of school maladaptation. These children were randomly assigned to an experimental condition (N=32)or placebo control (N=32).Individually designed prescriptive techniques were developed for high-risk children in the experimental group and were implemented by college student aides after training by the project staff. A multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up univariate analyses, testing differences between experimental and control groups on the posttests, were performed. The difference between the groups on all three criteria measures was significant and favored the experimental children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rickel Annette U; Smith Richard L; Sharp Kay C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00924514","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rickel Annette U, Smith Richard L, and Sharp Kay C (1979) Description and evaluation of a preventive mental health program for preschoolers.

Seventy first-grade children were involved in this 2-year follow-up. The experimental treatment group was superior to that of the placebo control group at follow-up on the criteria measures of behavioral adjustment and achievement. The low-risk “normal” control group was significantly different from that of the placebo control groups, but generally not significantly different from that of the experimental groups, suggesting that the intervention had boosted the high-risk experimental treatment children to the point where their performance was comparable to that of children who had not experienced behavioral or learning difficulties.","Comments":"Main DE: Focus on the treatment and placebo control groups\r\rESDE: Use the Caldwell total score, F(1, 65) = 8.378, p < .005. at post-test (p461) for intervention verusus placebo control.

Forty preschool age children were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Experimental subjects were trained in interpersonal problem solving skills for ten weeks, four days per week, for a total of 10-13 hours. Problem-solving skills were assessed at pretest, posttest, and three months after training was completed. Seventy-eight percent of the children who participated in pretest and posttest were tested at follow-up. Results indicated that the experimental group, compared to the control group, showed a significant increase in both cognitive-verbal and behavioral interpersonal problem-solving skills from pretest to posttest and that these changes were maintained at follow-up testing.

For example, one item assessing opening exercises ranged from, “The teacher greets classmates during opening exercises, but classmates usually do not greet each other,” to “The teacher greets classmates during opening exercises, and classmates usually greet each other.” An item assessing use of rules and logical consequences ranged from, “Teachers use praise and reward to reinforce the rules” to “The teacher reminds, reinforces, and redirects children in their practice of the rules.” Reliability estimate was computed for the 34 classroom practices items, resulting in a Cronbach's alpha of 0.91.\"\n\"The remaining seven items of this 41-item instrument were open-response questions and queried teachers about their classroom management and discipline strategies.

Teachers observed, practiced, and/or discussed key com- ponents of the RC Approach (i.e., Morning Meeting, Rules and Logical Consequences, Academic Choice, Guided Discovery, Understanding Children's Development, Com- municating with Families). This learning was reinforced with consultation opportunities where trainers visited teachers' classrooms two to four times per year for observation and consultation.\"\n\"The advanced RC training (RC 2 training) occurred on 5 individual days across the school year. The RC 2 training built upon the RC 1 training and provided more depth about the philosophy and practices of the RC Approach. RC 2 focused on advanced strategies such as procedures for problem-solving class meetings, a shift in teacher language from praise to encouragement (e.g., instead of saying, “good job,” saying “I noticed you were working hard on your math work”), and a greater range of strategies for working with and believing in the potential of children showing behavior problems (e.g., a move toward school-wide discipline strategies so that expectations are clear across classrooms and from year to year; use of a buddy system of teachers across classrooms to assist in the manage- ment of behavior problems).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rimm-Kaufman etal_2007.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215246,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215253,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":374202,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The present study employs a quasi-experimental design to examine the relation between use of the RC Approach and children's academic performance.

paper reports the results of a quasi-experimental study on the contribution of the Responsive Classroom (RC) Approach to elementary school children's reading and math performance over one-, two-, and three-year periods. All children enrolled in six schools (3 intervention and 3 control schools in a single district) were the participants in the study. Children's test scores in math and reading were used as outcomes, and data on treatment fidelity were used to describe differences in use of RC practices between intervention and control schools. Findings showed that, after controlling for poverty and test scores from previous years, the RC Approach contributed to the gains in both reading and math, with math showing greater difference between the intervention and control schools. The contribution of the RC Approach appeared to be greater over a three-year period than over a one or two-year period. These findings provide early evidence for the positive contribution of the RC Approach to gains in academic achievement. © 2006 Society for the Study of School Psychology.","Comments":"Main DE: Three year project, intervention versus controls - focus on cohort followed for 3 years as intervention continued for this groups.\rESDE: Primary outcome reading Grade 2 (after 3 years), used adjusted means for post-test (Table 2).

The purpose of this study was to determine if the summer school Step Up Program increases self-esteem resulting in improved attitudes toward study, increased attendance, academic success and improved student behavior. Method. Eighty students from two schools were involved in this study. Forty students who chose to attend the summer school Step Up Program formed the experimental group and forty students who were eligible to participate in the Step Up Program but chose not to participate in this program formed the control group. All students were given the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory at the end of their eighth grade year to determine their levels of self-esteem and the Study Attitudes and Methods Survey to determine their attitudes toward study. In addition, baseline data on attendance, grade point averages, and behavior incidents were collected. At the conclusion of the summer program both the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI) and the Study Attitudes and Methods Survey (SAMS) were given again to both groups as a posttest. At the conclusion of the first quarter of these students' ninth grade year the SEI and SAMS surveys were again administered as a follow-up. Follow-up data on attendance, grade point averages, and behavior incidents were also collected at the end of the first quarter of the students' ninth grade year. Results. The study results showed that the experimental group had significantly higher scores in attitudes in the areas of Academic Interest and Study Methods than the control group. Small but significant improvements in grade point averages were also noted for the experimental group when compared to the control group. No significant differences in self-esteem, attendance, or behavior referrals were noted. Although not statistically significant, anxiety about school performance and the tendency to manipulate teachers for favorable treatment warrant further study.","Comments":"Please focus on the

The two criteria tested were: (1) the theory of interpersonal cognitive problem solving (ICPS) skills as mediators of social adjustment and psychological functioning in inner-city fifth and sixth graders; and (2) the impact of a full-scaled four month ICPS intervention on behavioral adjustment and psychological functioning in school. By comparing ICPS-trained subjects (interpersonal cognition) with a group trained in Critical Thinking (impersonal cognition), investigators examined cognitive and behavioral impact after one exposure in grade 5, and after two exposures in grades 5 and 6. Results suggest that for this age and socio-economic status (SES) group, one exposure to ICPS training enhances ICPS and prosocial behaviors, but it requires a second exposure to reduce negative, impulsive, and inhibited behaviors. With no such interpersonal or behavior gains in the Critical Thinking (CT) groups for either year (CT groups actually became more impulsive from grade 5 to grade 6) it appears that ICPS training is a viable model of prevention for this age and SES group. Full behavioral impact for latency-aged, low SES youngsters may take longer than the briefer one-time exposure required for youngsters in preschool and kindergarten","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

program based upon a model of the normal development of social perspective taking was designed to facilitate perspective taking among fourth and fifth graders who initially performed below age norms. A sequence of interpersonal problems was presented. Each problem required solution at a more mature level of perspective taking than that required by the preceding problem. The principles involved were explained and children were actively engaged in developing solutions. The effect of this semistructured training was compared both to that of no-treatment and to that of an \"activity\" group. The latter comparison tested arguments that peer interaction of certain types facilitates perspective taking in the absence of explicit training. A rationale was presented for examining the differential effects of the activity and training groups on defensiveness and self-esteem as well as on perspective taking itself. Pre- to post-intervention change scores indicated that perspective taking logic, affective perspective taking, and self-esteem improved significantly more with training than with the no-treatment or activity groups. Defensiveness decreased significantly more in both intervention groups compared to no-treatment.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silvern Louise E; Waterman J M; Sobesky W ; Ryan V L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2307/1129063","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silvern Louise E, Waterman J M, Sobesky W, and Ryan V L (1979) Effects of a Developmental Model of Perspective Taking Training.

article reports the effects of a comprehensive elementary school-based social-emotional and character education program on school-level achievement, absenteeism, and disciplinary outcomes utilizing a matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled design. The Positive Action Hawai'i trial included 20 racially/ethnically diverse schools (M enrollment = 544) and was conducted from the 2002-03 through the 2005-06 academic years. Using school-level archival data, analyses comparing change from baseline (2002) to 1-year posttrial (2007) revealed that intervention schools scored 9.8% better on the TerraNova (2nd ed.) test for reading and 8.8% on math, that 20.7% better in Hawai'i Content and Performance Standards scores for reading and 51.4% better in math, and that intervention schools reported 15.2% lower absenteeism and fewer suspensions (72.6%) and retentions (72.7%). Overall, effect sizes were moderate to large (range = 0.5-1.1) for all of the examined outcomes. Sensitivity analyses using permutation models and random-intercept growth curve models substantiated results. The results provide evidence that a comprehensive school-based program, specifically developed to target student behavior and character, can positively influence school-level achievement, attendance, and disciplinary outcomes concurrently. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Comments":"Please focus in coding post-test outcomes.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Snyder F ; Flay B ; Vuchinich S ; Acock A ; Washburn I ; Beets M ; Li K K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19345740903353436","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Snyder F, Flay B, Vuchinich S, Acock A, Washburn I, Beets M, and Li K K (2010) Impact of a social-emotional and character development program on school-level indicators of academic achievement, absenteeism, and disciplinary outcomes: A matched-pair, cluster-randomized, controlled trial.

In the PMHP, children identified as being at risk with respect to early school maladjustment are paired with trained nonprofessional aides in a play-type setting. The role of the aide is to encourage the expression of feelings, to help develop coping skills, and to serve as an adult model. Evaluation studies, with primarily positive results, have been conducted; however, the majority of these studies have employed experimental and control schools matched on demographic variables. The present study examined PMHP's effectiveness employing random assignment of children to experimental and control conditions within a single school. Results indicated no significant differences between the groups on behavioral, self-concept, academic, and intellectual criteria.","Comments":"Last updated - 2018-08-31","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Suter Donna P; Kehle Thomas J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1300/J008v04n03_06","Keywords":"Behavior Patterns\nBehavior Rating Scales\nCoping\nERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE\nEarly Identification\nHigh Risk Students\nIntervention\nModels\nPrevention\nPrimary Education\nPrimary Mental Health Project\nResearch Methodology\nRole Models\nSchool Aides\nSelf Expression\nStudent Adjustment","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Suter Donna P, and Kehle Thomas J (1988) Evaluation of the Primary Mental Health Project Model of Early Identification and Prevention of School Adjustment Problems. : , 89-107 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1300/J008v04n03_06"},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023546,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"3","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":375111,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\" three partici­ pating schools[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Tobias, A.

Additionally,\nfocus was on the establishment of a \"skill\" domain to\nhelp students acquire strategies for self-awareness,\nself-evaluation, and self-monitoring. Self-regulatory\nskills for learning and remembering what was discussed\nin class, how to complete assignments, prepare for\ntests, complete homework, and improve study habits were\ntalked about during the mentoring sessions.

the increased development of mentoring programs, empirical studies of the association between mentoring and academic outcomes with at-risk adolescent populations are scant. While several studies (Brown, 1990; Hood, 1992; Solomon, 1991) imply that mentor relationships may positively influence achievement, this research seeks to investigate those claims. This study investigates the effects of a mentoring intervention with characteristics of \"will\" (support) and \"skill\" (self-regulation) on variables of self-efficacy, grade point average, teacher conduct ratings, number of unexcused absences, office referrals, suspensions, and self-perception for scholastic competence, social acceptance, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth. Subjects included 55 Black male 6th, 7th, and 8th graders selected from two middle schools by using a multidimensional at-risk rating procedure. Subjects were paired with high achieving Black males from two high schools. Subjects comprised two Treatment Groups and a Wait List Control Group. Groups were similar in terms of age, degree of risk, and intelligence. The treatment for G1 consisted of \"will\" and \"skill\" while the treatment for G2 included only the \"will\" component. For G1 and G2, treatment dyads occurred on eight consecutive weeks with dependent variables measured prior to the first mentoring session and again after the eighth session. A quasi-experimental, partially randomized design was used to provide comparison between treatment groups (G1 and G2) and a wait list control group (G3). Analyses of covariance with pretest scores as the covariates were used to ascertain the significance of hypothesized relationships between dependent and independent variables. Paired t-tests determined the significance of mean changes from pretest to posttest for each of the groups. There was a significant group effect of treatment on variables of self-efficacy, grade point average, and teacher conduct ratings with G1 significantly higher than the Wait List Control Group but no different from G2. Treatment G2 showed a significant mean change in self-efficacy while G1 displayed a significant mean change in grade point average. Results showed that modeling influences can be conveyed through the sharing of self-regulation strategies or by dialoguing with students through mentoring relationships that validate students' worth and significance.","Comments":"There are 2 different groups in this study.

While several studies (Brown, 1990; Hood, 1992; Solomon, 1991) imply that mentor relationships may positively influence achievement, this research seeks to investigate those claims. This study investigates the effects of a mentoring intervention with characteristics of \"will\" (support) and \"skill\" (self-regulation) on variables of self-efficacy, grade point average, teacher conduct ratings, number of unexcused absences, office referrals, suspensions, and self-perception for scholastic competence, social acceptance, behavioral conduct, and global self-worth. Subjects included 55 Black male 6th, 7th, and 8th graders selected from two middle schools by using a multidimensional at-risk rating procedure. Subjects were paired with high achieving Black males from two high schools. Subjects comprised two Treatment Groups and a Wait List Control Group. Groups were similar in terms of age, degree of risk, and intelligence. The treatment for G1 consisted of \"will\" and \"skill\" while the treatment for G2 included only the \"will\" component. For G1 and G2, treatment dyads occurred on eight consecutive weeks with dependent variables measured prior to the first mentoring session and again after the eighth session. A quasi-experimental, partially randomized design was used to provide comparison between treatment groups (G1 and G2) and a wait list control group (G3). Analyses of covariance with pretest scores as the covariates were used to ascertain the significance of hypothesized relationships between dependent and independent variables. Paired t-tests determined the significance of mean changes from pretest to posttest for each of the groups. There was a significant group effect of treatment on variables of self-efficacy, grade point average, and teacher conduct ratings with G1 significantly higher than the Wait List Control Group but no different from G2. Treatment G2 showed a significant mean change in self-efficacy while G1 displayed a significant mean change in grade point average. Results showed that modeling influences can be conveyed through the sharing of self-regulation strategies or by dialoguing with students through mentoring relationships that validate students' worth and significance.","Comments":"MDE: There are 2 different groups in this study.

The essence of this approach is that victims, victimizers, and bystanders are targeted simultaneously, without ascribing pathology to any individual. All children participate, with the healthier children assisting the more disturbed chil- dren, thus potentially avoiding the possible stigmatization and cost of medical labeling and referral.\"\n\"The program consisted of four components: 1) zero tol- erance for behavioral disturbances such as bullying, vic- timization, and standing by during violent acts, 2) a disci- pline plan for modeling appropriate behavior, 3) a physical education plan designed to teach self-regulation\"\n\"skills, and 4) a mentoring program for adults and children to assist children in avoiding one of the three preceding roles. Component one worked by increasing cognitive skills and awareness of roles and by changing language us- age. Component two was directed at viewing any behav- ioral disturbance as an interaction of all three roles in the triangle so that discipline focused on this process rather than attributing pathology to the bully. A time for reflec- tion on the process was set aside each day. Component three taught self-regulation skills in physical education classes through martial arts, role playing, and story read- ing, with attention to anger management and encourag- ing adoption of one or more of these three roles during conflict.

METHOD: The two schools were matched for demographic characteristics. The intervention in the experimental school was based on zero tolerance for bullying; the control school received only regular psychiatric consultation. Disciplinary and academic achievement data were collected in both schools. RESULTS: The experimental school showed significant reductions in discipline referrals and increases in scores on standardized academic achievement measures. CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost antiviolence intervention that does not focus on individual pathology or interfere with the educational process may improve the learning environment in elementary schools.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Twemlow Stuart W; Fonagy Peter ; Sacco Frank C; Gies Martin L; Evans Richard ; Ewbank Russell ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.158.5.808","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Twemlow Stuart W, Fonagy Peter, Sacco Frank C, Gies Martin L, Evans Richard, and Ewbank Russell (2001) Creating a peaceful school learning environment: A controlled study of an elementary school intervention to reduce violence.

The goal of this replication was to strengthen support for the intervention while contributing to the widely called for body of empirically based school counseling outcome research. Mid- to low-range-performing students in grades 5 and 6 participated. Gains in student academic achievement and behavior are reported and compared to positive outcomes from previous studies.

Teachers, administrators, and researchers implemented innovative practices communicating positive expectations for low-achieving adolescents in their transition to high school Changes were made in the practices of curriculum, grouping, evaluation, motivation, student responsibility, and relationships (in the classroom, with parents, and in the school). Both implementation and evaluation evolved as a function of collaboration. Change was promising but not uniform. Project teachers became more positive about students and colleagues, expanded their roles, and changed school tracking policies. The 158 project students, in contrast to the 154 comparison students showed improved grades and disciplinary referrals post-intervention and increased retention in school 1 year later, but their absences rose and improved performance was not maintained. The implications of this analysis for school-based interventions and its evaluation are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Weinstein Rhona S; Soule Charles R; Collins Florence ; Cone Joan ; Mehlhorn Michelle ; Sintontacchi Karen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Weinstein Rhona S, Soule Charles R, Collins Florence, Cone Joan, Mehlhorn Michelle, and Sintontacchi Karen (1991) Expectations and high school change: Teacher-researcher collaboration to prevent school failure.

A total of 97 students participated in this study. There were 46 students in the comparison group and 51 students in the intervention group. Information on grade point averages, absences, and discipline referrals was gathered over the three school calendar years of 1992-1993, 1993-1994, and 1994-1995. Information on student attitudes about conflict, self-concept, and teacher ratings of students was gathered at the end of the school calendar year of 1994-1995. Data analyses utilized split-plot multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance. Ten of 12 null hypotheses were rejected. Intervention students improved their grade point average and reduced their discipline referrals and school absences when compared with the comparison group. Intervention students also had more positive attitudes toward conflict resolution. The data strongly support the effectiveness of conflict resolution for improving student performance.","Comments":"This study provides data at 3 different time points. 1992-1993 (Baseline), 1993-1994 (Year 1) and 1994-1995 (Year 2).

The programme consists of a series of 10 weekly sessions covering topics such as recognising symptoms of anxiety, emotional self-management and supporting peer relationships. Each session is enhanced by a series of additional activities that can be used to practice the newly learned skills as well as homework activities. The Salus Group (Salus), a training provider offering a range of programmes in schools, within the community and at home, delivered the intervention. Salus delivers FRIENDS in the UK and is not affiliated with the original FRIENDS developers. The project was a cluster-randomised control trial. 122 Year 5 classes in 79 participating primary schools were randomised to either receive FRIENDS or to act as a business as usual control group. The evaluation tested the impact of FRIENDS on the attainment of pupils, measured by combined Key Stage 2 English and Maths scores, and also on health measures of self-rated worry, anxiety and depression, and teacherrated difficulties. The process evaluation involved interviews with various stakeholders, class observations and focus groups with pupils.
