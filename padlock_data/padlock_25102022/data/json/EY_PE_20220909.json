effects of a parent education program on the development of children aged between 60 and 72 months attending preschool were assessed.

Data were gathered using a general information form, and the version of the Brigance Early Development Inventory II (Brigance, 2004), that was adapted for use in Turkey by Aral et al. (2008). There was a significant difference between the scores on the subtests of the Brigance Early Development Inventory II and the total pretest and corrected posttest scores independent of group, but no significant difference was found between the scores of the groups on the Brigance Early Development Inventory II or the total pretest and corrected posttest scores. The results also revealed that the parent education program had a minimal effect on children’s daily life and social emotional skills.","Comments":"Please treat academic/cognitive skills as the primary and receptive/expressive language skills as the secondary outcome.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aral Neriman ; Baran Gülen ; Gürsoy Figen ; Akyol Aysel Köksal; Ayhan Aynur Bütün; Biçakçi Müdriye Yildiz; Erdoğan Serap ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2011.39.2.241","Keywords":"CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT\r\nPRESCHOOL EDUCATION\r\nPARENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS\r\nTURKEY","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aral Neriman, Baran Gülen, Gürsoy Figen, Akyol Aysel Köksal, Ayhan Aynur Bütün, Biçakçi Müdriye Yildiz, and Erdoğan Serap (2011) The effects of parent education programs on the development of children aged between 60 and 72 months.

a two-year, free, home-based, family-oriented, early childhood education intervention - was assessed in a longitudinal, two cohort, randomized experimental evaluation. One hundred and eighty-two low-income families (84 in HIPPY and 98 in the control group) were assessed at baseline, at the end of the program, and one year later. Outcomes included assessments of children's cognitive skills, adaptation to the classroom, and standardized achievement at the end of the two-year program, and classroom adaptation and standardized achievement one year later. Data were collected from objective measures, teacher ratings, and school records. Analyses of covariance were conducted controlling for baseline scores on child and family background variables. Results revealed that for Cohort I there were significant and educationally meaningful differences in children's school performance both at the end of the program and one year later. These results were not replicated in Cohort II. Attrition analyses did not reveal differences between groups and cohorts which would account for the lack of replication. Findings are interpreted as mixed support for the effectiveness of the HIPPY program to improve the chances that poor children will succeed in school.","Comments":"MDE: Please code for cohort 1","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baker A J.

The printed version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Parent (DISC-P) version 2.1 that was constructed and used in the DSM-IV ?eld trials for the Disruptive Behavior Disorders (Lahey et al., 1994) was employed in this study. This particular interview was designed to collect information on both DSM-III-R and DSM- IV symptom lists for 12 childhood disorders. Since the ?nal DSM-IV symptom lists for each disorder are now published, the present project employed those criteria in the scoring of the results of this interview rather than using the older DSM-III-R criteria. The interview also required that both the parent and interviewer provide separate estimates of the child’s global assessment of functioning scale using a range of 0 to 100 with lower scores re?ecting poorer global functioning.\"\n\"Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edel- brock, 1983). This scale provides T-scores for seven diﬀerent dimensions of child psychopathology and has been used extensively in child mental health research. The revised 1991 scoring sytem was employed in this study. The Sex Problems, Somatic Complaints, and Thought Problems scales were not used given that these domains offunctioning were not a focus of this intervention program and that there is no equivalent Sex Problems scale on the teacher version of the CBCL also used in this project (see below). The scales used were those for Withdrawal, AnxietyDepression, Social Problems, Attention Problems, Aggression, and Delinquent Behavior.\"\n\"Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ; Barkley, 1990). This scale assesses the pervasiveness of behavior problems across 16 diﬀerent home and public setttings (Number of Problem Settings) and the severity of these behavior problems (Mean Severity Score) as rated on a Likert scale of 1 to 9. These two raw scores were used in this study.\"\n\"Normative Adaptive Behavior Checklist (Adams, 1984). This 120-item questionnaire surveys parents about a child’s adaptive functioning in eight areas of development, including ﬁne motor, gross motor, language, and self-help skills, in- dependence, home responsibilities, etc. The total adaptive behavior score (standard score) was used here.\"\n\"Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI; Abidin, 1986). This is a shortened version of the original PSI and is completed by parents. It evaluates the degree of perceived stress in the role of being a parent to this particular child. Only the Total Stress raw score was used here.\"\n\"Parenting Sense ofCompetence Scale (Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman, 1978; Mash & Johnston, 1983). This self-report scale was employed to evaluate a parent’s degree of self- perceived competence or eﬃcacy (nine items) and satisfaction (seven items) in their role as a parent. It produces separate raw scores for each of these two domains.\"\n\"CBCL-Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1986): This scale contains 126 items related to children’s behavioral and emotional problems. It yields eight T- scores identical to those for the parent version noted above with the exception that no Sex Problems scale is generated. Again, the 1991 scoring system was employed for this study. The scales used were for Withdrawal, AnxietyDepression, Social Prob- lems, Attention Problems, Aggression, and Delinquent Be- havior. The Somatic Complaints and Thought Problems scales were not employed here given that these domains offunctioning were not speciﬁcally targeted within the intervention programs.\"\n\"School Situations Questionnaire (SSQ; Barkley, 1990). This rating scale provided a measure of the pervasiveness of a child’s behavior problems across 12 diﬀerent school situations (Number ofProblems Settings). Each problem setting was rated as to severity using a Likert scale (1–9) so as to provide a Mean Severity Score across all problem settings. Raw scores were used here.\"\n\"Self-Control Rating Scale (Kendall & Wilcox, 1979). This is a 33-item scale used to assess children’s self-control. A single summary raw score was generated for this behavioral di- mension.\"\n\"Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS; Gresham & Elliott, 1990). This standardized and normed teacher-completed scale was used to assess the social skills (30 items), behavioral problems (18 items), and academic competence (9 items) of the children. Three standard scores were obtained from this scale, one for each domain.\"\n\"Woodcock Johnson Psychoeducational Test Battery (Woodcock&Johnson, 1984). This lengthy test battery includes a number of tests assessing cognitive abilities (intelligence) as well as a separate battery of tests assessing academic knowledge (science, social studies, humanities) and skills (reading, math, spelling). Standard scores are produced for each subtest. Only the academic knowledge and skills tests were used in assessing treatment eﬀects.\"\n\"Continuous Performance Test (CPT; Gordon, 1983). The preschool version was used here, which provided raw scores for total correct and number of commission errors. The task uses a single digit target (‘‘1’’) that appears in a random series ofdigits presented at the rate of one per second on the display screen of a small computerized device. The task lasts 6 minutes. Due to the young age of the subjects and consistent with recom- mendations of the test developer, the examiner remained in the room during the testing.\"\n\"Disruptive behavior during the CPT. During the child’s performance of the CPT, the child’s behavior was videotaped from behind a one-way mirror. These videotapes were later coded for four categories of behavior related to ADHD using the Restricted Academic Situations Coding System developed by Barkley (1990). These categories were: oﬀ-task, ﬁdgets, vocalizes, and out-of-seat. Deﬁnitions of the codes and inform- ation on the reliability and validity of the system can be found\"\n\"Parenting Practices Scale (Strayhorn & Weidman, 1988).\"\n\"This is a 34-item scale used to assess the extent to which parents\nuse various practices commonly taught in most behavioral\nparent training programs. A single raw summary score was used\nhere.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Barkley etal_2000.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":414575,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"elsewhere (Barkley, 1990). The examiner records the occurrence\nof each behavior category within each 15-second interval. The\nmeasures derived from this coding system were obtained by\ncalculating the percentage occurrence of each category of\nbehavior relative to its total possible occurrences. A second\ncoder independently recoded 20% of the videotapes so as to\nprovide an estimate of inter-coder reliability for this measure.\nAgreement between these two coders for these observations was\ncomputed using Pearson product-moment correlations for the\nscores of percentage occurrence for each behavioral category.\nThe inter-coder agreements across the three cohorts for each\ncategory were: o?-taskl.97, ?dgetsl.93, vocalizesl.95,\nand out-of-seatl.97.\"\n\"Classroom behavioral observations. To record the behavior of\nchildren in their classrooms, this study employed the CBCL-\nDirect Observation Form (DOF; Achenbach, 1986). This\ncoding system is designed to assess the same behavioral items\nthat are found on the parent and teacher versions of the CBCL\ndescribed earlier. The observer visited the child’s classroom and\nobserved the child for 1 hour, after which the rating scale was\ncompleted by the observer. The total raw scores for the\nexternalizing and internalizing items were scored separately and\nreported here. For 20% of the subjects, a second observer\naccompanied the ﬁrst to the same classroom and observed the\nchild for the same 1-hour interval, after which they completed\nthis observation form. The two coders in this case sat at\ndiﬀerent locations in the classroom so as to avoid observing the\nother’s completion of this observation form. Inter-coder re-\nliability was calculated using a Pearson product-moment corre-\nlation separately for the externalizing, internalizing, and total\nraw scores with the following results : internalizing symptoms,\n.69, externalizing symptoms, .80, and total symptoms, .75.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Barkley etal_2000.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414575,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Mental health history.

This task was designed to be comparable to the\nRestricted Academic Situations task used with school-age\nADHD children (Barkley, 1990). Typically, this procedure\ninvolves placing the child in a clinic playroom with adjacent\nobservation room and shared one-way mirror and having the\nchild sit alone and perform math problems. Because of the\nyoung age ofthe subjects used here, this procedure was modiﬁed\nsuch that the child was required to sort plastic colored chips into\ncontainers by their color (red, blue, white) instead ofperforming\nmath problems. The task lasted 15 minutes. The child was\nvideotaped from behind the one-way mirror during this task.\nThe same four behavior categories used during the CPT were\nscored for their percentage occurrence in order to measure\nADHD symptoms during task performance. Additionally, the\nnumber of chips sorted by the child was also scored. A second\ncoder independently recoded 20% of the videotapes so as to\nprovide an estimate of inter-coder reliability for this measure.\nAgreement was computed using Pearson product-moment cor-\nrelations for the percentage occurrence scores for each behav-\nioral category and the results were: oﬀ-taskl.94, ﬁdgetsl\n.95, vocalizesl.98, and out-of-seatl.98.\"\n\"Mother–childinteractions during free play andtask periods.\nMothers and children were asked to play with each other using\ntoys in a playroom for a 10-minute period. The mother was then\ngiven a list of commands to have her child perform (i.e. pick up\ntoys, dust a table, pick up trash scattered about the ﬂoor, pick\nup clothes scattered about the ﬂoor and put them into a box,\ndraw a line together through a maze on an Etch-A-Sketch toy,\nand have child copy a simple geometric design). During this\nperiod a television played a videotape of a popular cartoon\nshow (Scoobie Doo) in the background to serve as a distractor\nto the child. These free play and task settings were videotaped\nfrom behind a one-way mirror.\"\n\"Examiner ratings of subject’s behavior throughout testing.A\nrating scale was created comprising 17 items of various\nbehavioral problems. These included problems in the domains\nof inattention, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, deﬁance, anger,\naggressiveness, frustration, anxiety, sadness, and withdrawal.\nEach item was rated on a Likert 7-point scale (1–7) by the\nResearch Technician based upon the subject’s behavior\nthroughout the entire testing period.

These 'disruptive' children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year: no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains: parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother-child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children. Even so, most treatment effects were specific to the school environment and did not affect achievement skills. These findings must be viewed as tentative until follow-up evaluations can be done to determine the long-term outcomes of these interventions.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 4 arms.

The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Beach D W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beach D W (2004) The effects of a school district's kindergarten readiness summer program on phonological awareness skills of at-risk prekindergarten students: A regression discontinuity analysis. , Utah State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":864342,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"The second phase of the study aimed to examine if an early enrichment program\nproviding the child with school readiness skills enabled the child to start ahead and enjoy\ninitial success in primary school.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bekman_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":864342,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"The Mother–Child Education Program focuses on both the child and the child’s immediate\nenvironment rather than reaching only the child.

paper presents the results of an evaluation research that studied the impact of a nationwide home intervention program, the Mother-Child Education Program, on both children and mothers immediately after the termination of the program and at the end of the children's first year of formal schooling. A prebost control group quasiexperimental design was used. There were 102 experimental and 115 control mother-child pairs, the total sample being 217. The results revealed that the Program has important effects on the cognitive development of the child as reflected in the significant increase in the performance of the group receiving training with respect to preliteracy and prenumeracy skills. When the children were followed in their first year of schooling, the experimental children were found to be better at in literacy and numeracy skills and had started to read earlier than the control group. Furthermore, their end-of-year grades were better than their counterparts. Teachers also perceived them as meeting the cognitive and social requirements of the school and being more curious, attentive, and creative.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bekman Sevda ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s19309325nhsa0701_4","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bekman Sevda (2004) Early home intervention to promote school readiness: A Turkish experience.

whether boys read to by their fathers for the six-month period immediately preceding entrance into first grade would score significantly higher on predictor instruments for first-grade reading achievement when compared with boys read to by their mothers or boys in an unplanned situation for the same period. All boys in a central New York State school's kindergarten sections were assigned to a father -read- to , a mother-read- to , a father -not-participating, or a control (unplanned reading ) group for a six-month treatment period. The experimental groups were read to by the assigned parent reader about two or three times a week. The dependent variables were letter naming and word recognition (isolated words and words in context). The predictor criterion measures were administered individually at the conclusion of treatment, which coincided with the beginning of the boys ' first-grade school year. Within the context of the study's limitations, the results indicated that father -read- to boys had significantly higher mean scores on the words in context or criterion measure than the mother-read- to , the father -not-participating, or the control group of boys .","Comments":"MDE: Please code for mothers and fathers as treatment vs control.\rESDE: Combine Ns Means and SDs for mothers and fathers participating versus control.

A parental assistance plan (PAP) was devised to involve parents in working on language with their children at home 20 minutes a day & brought the parents into school a few hours per week for 12 weeks. The mothers of 2 groups followed the PAP (1 group also received the Distar language program), 1 group received only the Distar, & 1 group received no formal intervention but merely played with toys in the presence of a teacher for an equivalent period.

For example, the participants were provided with the opportunity to\nengage in hands-on practice with the literacy activities, as well as demonstration,\nobservation, and discussion o f the activities. In addition, the training was designed from a\nstrengths perspective, in order to recognize the skills and knowledge parents/caregivers may\nalready have had about literacy activities and to build on that background (DHHS, n.d.).

Twenty-seven Head Start children, ages 3 to 5, and their parents/caregivers participated in the study. An experimental-control group design to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention and the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening for Preschoolers (PALS-PreK) was used as a pre and post-test assessment. Results indicated there were no significant interactions of the intervention and children's scores for the intact groups. There were also no significant changes in parent behaviors and attitudes toward reading, as measured by a family reading survey, as a result of the intervention. During post hoc analyses, an age effect was investigated and results indicated 4-year-old children in the intervention group scored significantly higher than 4-year-old children in the control group. In addition, 4- and 5-year-old children in the intervention group also made significant gains on the print awareness subtest of the PALS-PreK. Anecdotal changes in parent and children behavior as a result of the intervention are also reported. Recommendations include expanding parent-child literacy activities from shared story-book reading and addressing attrition problems in studies with families from impoverished backgrounds.","Comments":"Coders: Please use combined scores for 3, 4 and 5 year-old, experimental vs. control.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Boyle Elizabeth A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Boyle Elizabeth A (2006) The effects of a parent-child early literacy intervention on children's phonemic awareness and preliteracy skills. , The Johns Hopkins University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215228,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":488584,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"the effects of teaching the\nparticipating Even Start mothers a shared book reading strategy[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Brickman_2002.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":488584,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"The design for this study was a two-group pretest posttest comparison, a\nquasi- experimental design.

Even Start mothers to use dialogic reading strategies with their preschool children were examined in this experimental study. Thirty-four children and their mothers participated. Mothers in the treatment group were taught to use the strategy to engage their children in conversation while reading storybooks. Data gathered from the children at pretest and posttest were measures of receptive vocabulary (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised), expressive vocabulary by calculating mean length of utterance and concepts about print using a checklist. Use of the Adult/Child Interactive Reading Inventory (ACIRI) provided data about mother and child behaviors at pretest and posttest. An attitudinal measure assessed the trained mothers' self-efficacy as a literacy coach. Findings include direct effects on the mothers' ability to use the strategy as well as indirect effects on the children's emergent literacy behaviors. Statistically significant effects were found for concepts about print (p < .05) using an ANOVA. A strong positive correlation (r(12) = .85, p < .001) between the treatment group mother's and child's ACIRI score was found. Time spent in Even Start (p < .02) and the mother's ACIRI score (p < .01) were positively related to the child's mean length of utterance in a multiple linear regression analysis. A moderate positive correlation was found (r(12) = .54, p < .05) for the relation between the mother's ACIRI score and the self-efficacy measure at posttest. Implications include a promising reading strategy resulting in the growth of emergent literacy skills for bilingual children and changed reading behaviors for their mothers in workshop format that could be easily and inexpensively incorporated into existing curriculum in intergenerational literacy programs.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code PPVT-R as primary, Concepts of print and Expressive language as secondary outcomes.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Brickman Sharon Olivia; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education\nReading.\nHispanic American Children Education (Preschool)\nReading (Preschool)\nReading Parent Participation.\nEven Start Program (U.S.)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brickman Sharon Olivia (2002) Effects of a joint book reading strategy on Even Start. , The University of Oklahoma."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8623883,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"Parental Engagement","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":682265,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Tutor­\ning sessions were structured and used rich\nreading materials.

It was also suggested to parents and children to read in close physical prox­ imity to make the experience more intimate and enjoyable. 5) Quality of the material. Good quality materials were used with all sub­ jects to ensure a certain uniformity and enjoyment of reading. Since the reading materials available to each child at home were different, we gave a standard mater­ ial package to all participants. This package included 50 Hash cards (26 letters, 16 con­ sonant-vowel syllables and 8 consonant-vow el-consonant syllables) and 32 small first grade books from a popular series of child literature in Quebec. The flash cards were used for letter reading and syllable recognition activities, while the small books were introduced to practice reading with prose-like materials. The sto­ ries included in the books were adapted to the reading level of the pupils and followed the progression of materials received in school.

This is a test\nadministered exclusively orally where the\npupil is invited to play with sounds. Gen­\nerally, the test consisted in making a child\nrepeat a word, then asking him/her to say\nit again by removing a particular sound\n(omission of a syllable or phoneme). For\nexample, the examiner asked the child to\nrepeat the word * Hying', then asked him to\nrepeal it again but without the fing' sound\nat the end of the word. The child then had\nto say the word *fly' in order to pass that\nitem. The lest was divided in eight cate­\ngories in which the pupil had to repeal a\nword by eliminating a syllabic or phoneme\neither at the beginning, in the middle oral\nthe end of the word. In the first, second\nand seventh categories, the child had to\nremove a syllable at the end, al the begin-\nning and in the middle of a word,\nrespectively. In the third category, the pupil\nhad to remove a phoneme at the end of a\nword, whereas in the fourth and fifth cat­\negories, he/she had to remove a phoneme\nat the beginning of a w ord. Finally, for the\nsixth and eighth categories, the child bad\nto remove a phoneme placed in the mid­\ndle of a word. The lest ended when two\nconsecutive categories were entirely failed.\nEach category included eight items and\nscores ranged from 0 to 8.

is a body of literature suggesting that involving parents in their children's education is an effective strategy for children at risk of reading failure. In a pre-test/post-test control group design, parents in an experimental group received reading materials and were trained on techniques to stimulate their child during paired reading at home, while a control group only received materials. Reading and general academic abilities were pre- and post-tested, as well as phonological awareness and self-concept. The results show statistically significant gains in general academic abilities and phonological awareness in favor of the experimental group, while no significant gains were noted in reading abilities and self-concept. This report discusses the factors which could explain those results.","Comments":"Please code reading as the primary outcome\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cadieux Alain ; Boudreault Paul ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Parent participation (Education)\r\nReading skills","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cadieux Alain, and Boudreault Paul (2005) The effects of a parent-child paired reading program on reading abilities, phonological awareness and self-concept of at-risk pupils.

study investigated the effects of a family-centered intervention that involved parents in weekly assessments and daily routine activities for promoting young children’s language and behavior. Forty-one 3–5-year-old children at-risk for language and behavior problems, recruited from three developmental pre-schools, were randomly assigned to a control and an intervention group that received parent–professional support. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to examine whether groups differed on post-test scores on the Test of Early Language Development—Third Edition and Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, using pre-test scores as a covariate. Results showed that children in the intervention group outperformed children in the control group on both tests. The study indicated that familycentered intervention is an effective method for empowering parents to identify and implement concrete solutions to their children’s problems, especially when done as part of a professional collaboration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chao Pen-Chiang ; Bryan Tanis ; Burstein Karen ; Ergul Cevriye ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-005-0032-4","Keywords":"at-risk children\r\nfamily-centered intervention\r\nparent–professional collaboration\r\nlanguage\r\nbehavior","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chao Pen-Chiang, Bryan Tanis, Burstein Karen, and Ergul Cevriye (2006) Family-centered intervention for young children at-risk for language and behavior problems.

Hong Kong Chinese kindergarten children were pretested on the Preschool and Primary Chinese Literacy Scale (PPCLS) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test?Third Edition (PPVT-III), and assigned randomly within schools to 1 of 3 conditions, dialogic reading, typical reading and control. After an 8- week intervention, the children were posttested. Results indicated a significant main group effect for performance on both the PPCLS and the PPVT-III, with children in the dialogic reading group benefiting significantly from the intervention. These results indicate that early literacy-related activities in the home have strong and direct effects on both children's literacy growth and language development in Chinese. The success of the dialogic reading technique in this study contributes to the goal of raising global literacy standards and educational achievement.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 3 arms.

Children were pretested on Chinese character recognition, vocabulary, morphological awareness, and reading interest and then assigned randomly to 1 of 4 conditions: the dialogic reading with morphology training (DR + MT), dialogic reading (DR), typical reading, or control condition. After a 12-week intervention period, the DR intervention yielded greater gains in vocabulary, and the DR + MT intervention yielded greater improvement in character recognition and morphological awareness. Both interventions enhanced children's reading interest. Results confirm that different home literacy approaches influence children's oral and written language skills differently: Shared book reading promotes language development, whereas parents' explicit metalinguistic training within a shared book reading context better prepares children for learning to read.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

this study, we instructed parents and early childhood special education staff in Dialogic Reading, an interactive language facilitation technique. We compared the effects of this instruction on adult and child language during shared book reading and on children's vocabulary growth in three different treatment conditions. Thirty-two children with language delays were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) parent instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (b) staff instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (c) staff instruction without one-on-one shared book reading practice (control group). Children were given standardized tests of vocabulary and were videotaped during shared book reading before and after the 8-week intervention period. Parents and staff showed changes in their shared book reading style consistent with the instruction they had received. After adult instruction in Dialogic Reading, children in all three groups spoke more, made longer utterances, produced more different words, and participated more in shared book reading. The magnitude of change in the children's linguistic performance from pre- to posttest was positively correlated with the magnitude of change in adult behavior. There were no statistically significant changes in children's vocabulary test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with a Vygotskian model in which children's linguistic performance can be enhanced by a supportive social context. © 1999, Sage Publications.

At\nthe second instructional session, the original strategies\nwere reviewed and two additional strategies were intro­\nduced, again summarized on a handout.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Crain-Thoreson & Dale_1999_ocr.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215244,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215251,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":458528,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Based on the children’s\npretest PPVT-R scores, triads of children with similar re­\nceptive vocabulary scores were formed.

this study, we instructed parents and early childhood special education staff in Dialogic Reading, an interactive language facilitation technique. We compared the effects of this instruction on adult and child language during shared book reading and on children’s vocabulary growth in three different treatment conditions. Thirty two children with language delays were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) parent instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (b) staff instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (c) staff instruction without one-on-one shared book reading practice (control group). Children were given standardized tests of vocabulary and were videotaped during shared book reading before and after the 8-week intervention period. Parents and staff showed changes in their shared book reading style consistent with the instruction they had received. After adult instruction in Dialogic Reading, children in all three groups spoke more, made longer utterances, produced more different words, and participated more in shared book reading. The magnitude of change in the children’s linguistic performance from pre- to posttest was positively correlated with the magnitude of change in adult behavior. There were no statistically significant changes in children’s vocabulary test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with a Vygotskian model in which children’s linguistic performance can be enhanced by a supportive social context.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms.

Student Texas Primary Reading Inventory (TPRI) scores were obtained and analyzed for gains in score from the Middle of Year (MOY) and End of Year (EOY) administration. Parents were provided School Home Links Activity Guide Homework to use with their child on a weekly basis for twelve weeks. This group formed an experimental group. A control group did not receive SHL activity guide homework. For the control and experimental group each student's letter/sound score was entered into SPSS for the MOY and EOY TPRI, and average gains were calculated. Groups of students were isolated and analyzed for gain based upon participation in a district reading program, and/or high or low parental involvement in SHL activity guide homework. Research in the upper grades shows that homework completion and parent involvement positively affect student achievement. Students whose parents are involved in their education reap many benefits. These benefits include higher academic achievement (Davies, 1991). Fuller & Olsen (1998), Davies (1991), and Epstein (1995) believe parent involvement is a stronger indicator of student achievement than socioeconomic status, parent education, ethnicity, or any other indicator. The research supports the use of homework for upper grades. The results of this study remain inconclusive for kindergarten age students. This study shows that there is no statistically significant difference between experimental and control group kindergarten TPRI scores when homework is an independent variable.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Davis Jill Marie; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\nMajor Curriculum and Instruction\r\nGenre/Form: Academic theses.\r\nAcademic theses.\r\nreading\r\nparent involvement\r\nkindergarten","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davis Jill Marie (2004) The impact of parental involvement : A study of the relationship between homework and kindergarten Texas Primary Reading Inventory scores. , Texas A&M University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215276,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"island ofOahu in that state ofHawaii[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5372848,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"located on the urban island ofOahu in that state ofHawaii[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5372849,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"urban island[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Learning Connections[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215410,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Head Start class-\nrooms\"\n\"Children’s mean age at pretest was 47.10 months (range = 31–56\nmonths)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"126","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Complete pre- and\nposttest data were available for 126 children.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215433,"AdditionalText":"mean age = 47.10 months (range 31-35 months)\nHead Start Schools cater for children from birth to 5 years old","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Children’s mean age at pretest was 47.10 months (range = 31–56\nmonths)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215434,"AdditionalText":"mean age = 47.10 months (range 31-35 months)\nHead Start Schools cater for children from birth to 5 years old","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Children’s mean age at pretest was 47.10 months (range = 31–56\nmonths)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"an emergent literacy and mathematics enrichment curriculum for 3- to\n5-year-old children[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215644,"AdditionalText":"48","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"52% were boys.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5366637,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215245,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"For the two sites with multiple classrooms, both\nclassrooms were assigned to the same treatment condition.

Participants were 126 Head Start children, their teachers, and their parents. Matched centers were assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: experimental literacy, experimental math, or control. Teachers in both experimental groups implemented either literacy or math instruction in small groups on a daily basis, and parents and children completed supplementary learning activities at home. The control classroom implemented the ongoing Head Start curriculum. Children in the literacy condition showed the largest gains in phonemic awareness and emergent writing skills; they also made greater gains on emergent reading than did children in the math condition. There were no group differences on expressive vocabulary. Results are discussed in terms of curriculum design and practical issues involved in supporting preschools in the implementation of research-based instructional programs.

Phonemic awareness, emergent writing and vocabulary as secondary outcomes. Also extract Math condition as active control for Literacy group (4 outcome).

Because teacher assignment was contingent on location,\nsome teachers were occasionally assigned to implement one type\nof intervention more than others. Nevertheless, all teachers were\nassigned at least one family per type of intervention (see Figure 1).\nTeachers were divided into two batches and received a 1-day\ntraining seminar each by Katrina May Dulay on the DR and EL\ninterventions. After this, a field test was conducted and was video\nrecorded with selected teachers. The recordings were then shown\nand discussed in a follow-up meeting with the teachers.

childhood interventions that target numeracy, language, and literacy skills can help to mitigate negative educational outcomes among young children from low- to middle-income families in developing countries. The current study evaluates the efficacy of parent coaching programs designed to enrich home numeracy and literacy environments in Cebu City, Philippines. A total of 673 families with 3- to 5-year-old children were randomly assigned to the numeracy, dialogic reading, early literacy skills training, and control groups. Following the 12-week intervention, children in the 578 families that participated in the posttest generally demonstrated a differential pattern of skill gains according to program content. Children in the numeracy group manifested improved basic and complex numeracy skills, and children in the dialogic reading group demonstrated gains in vocabulary knowledge for words in the books that they were exposed to, as well as print and word awareness, to a limited degree. Children in the early literacy skills training group had improved letter name knowledge, phonological awareness, and print and word awareness skills. Evidence of cross-domain transfer from early literacy skills training to some numeracy skills, as well as variations according to socioeconomic status, level of parental involvement, and teacher assignment in the program, were observed in the results. Results are discussed in relation to the specificity of program effects, cross-domain transfer effects, and improvements needed to maximize intervention program benefits among the children who need them the most.

childhood interventions that target numeracy, language, and literacy skills can help to mitigate negative educational outcomes among young children from low- to middle-income families in developing countries. The current study evaluates the efficacy of parent coaching programs designed to enrich home numeracy and literacy environments in Cebu City, Philippines. A total of 673 families with 3- to 5-year-old children were randomly assigned to the numeracy, dialogic reading, early literacy skills training, and control groups. Following the 12-week intervention, children in the 578 families that participated in the posttest generally demonstrated a differential pattern of skill gains according to program content. Children in the numeracy group manifested improved basic and complex numeracy skills, and children in the dialogic reading group demonstrated gains in vocabulary knowledge for words in the books that they were exposed to, as well as print and word awareness, to a limited degree. Children in the early literacy skills training group had improved letter name knowledge, phonological awareness, and print and word awareness skills. Evidence of cross-domain transfer from early literacy skills training to some numeracy skills, as well as variations according to socioeconomic status, level of parental involvement, and teacher assignment in the program, were observed in the results. Results are discussed in relation to the specificity of program effects, cross-domain transfer effects, and improvements needed to maximize intervention program benefits among the children who need them the most.

The main aim of the study was to investigate the effects of PEEP on the children and families from the community it served. Embedded within this aim were dual objectives: to determine if the intervention had an effect within the community as a whole, and simultaneously to determine whether it had an effect on the sub?group of families who participated in the PEEP weekly sessions. Outcomes in favour of the intervention were found for parents and for children's progress in language and early literacy skills, both at community and sub?group level. The study is located within a discussion of social exclusion, the potentially mediating influence of education and the accessibility of literacy skills to intervention and change.","Comments":"Include\rMainDE: Two reports of the same study are available for data extraction\rESDE: Use Evangelou_Sylva_2007 for post-test only scores (Table 7) as Evangelou 2007 is missing SDs or CIs.\rVerbal comprehension and Early Number concepts as primary, Vocabulary and Phonological awareness as secondaries.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Evangelou Maria ; Brooks Greg ; Smith Sally ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03054980701476477","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Evangelou Maria, Brooks Greg, and Smith Sally (2007) The Birth to School Study: evidence on the effectiveness of PEEP, an early intervention for children at risk of educational under‐achievement.

paper reports on a low cost intervention program implemented into the homes of 34 preschool children at risk of reading failure. The intervention was targeted at families where there was a history of reading disability. Families were instructed in dialogic reading via videotaped examples of good practice. The intervention took place over eight weeks. Pre‐ and post‐ measures of language and literacy were taken for experimental and control groups. The intervention was successful in raising levels of concepts about print for the experimental group; receptive vocabulary and alphabet knowledge improved for the control group. There were no significant changes in measures of expressive vocabulary, rhyme and initial sounds. For students in both groups, gender was associated with rhyme, and concepts of print; parent educational level was associated with alphabet knowledge, and expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fielding-Barnsley Ruth ; Purdie Nola M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19404150209546703","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fielding-Barnsley Ruth, and Purdie Nola M (2002) Developing pre-literacy skills via shared book reading assessment of a family intervention program for pre-school children at risk of becoming reading disabled.

Three\nfamilies are shown on the videotape, with each family\nconcentrating on a different aspect of dialogic reading.\nThere are examples emphasising rhyme, vocabulary and\nCAP. Each family also received written information about\nthe dialogic reading process, thereby extending the visual\ninformation provided on the videotape. This was in the form\nof a four-page pamphlet developed by The University of\nNew England School of Psychology’s Early Literacy\nTeam (Byrne, Fielding-Barnsley, Delaland, Mackay and\nBlack, 1999). This pamphlet contains sections on: ‘How to\npromote pre-reading skills in your child; Read with your\nchild; Let your child tell the story; Play with speech\nsounds: Rhyme and alliteration; Teach your child about\nthe alphabet; and Teach your child about the sounds\nthat make up words … and how letters stand for these\nsounds.’[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Fielding‐Barnsley (2003).pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416359,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Each family was provided with a selection of eight picture\nbooks, a Parents’ Handbook (Barrs and Ellis, 1998), and a\nreading together record form.

preschoolers from low‐income families participated in a 12‐month intervention programme, funded by Sure Start, which engaged them in scaffolded educational activities delivered at home by their mothers. Immediately following the programme, the intervention group outperformed matched controls in tests of academic knowledge, receptive vocabulary, and inhibitory control, but not short‐term memory or theory of mind. Teachers' ratings of children's capabilities upon school entry favoured the intervention group, especially in terms of listening, responding, writing, mathematics, and personal/social skills. Superior inhibitory control, short‐term memory, and numerical skills were associated with higher ratings whereas theory of mind made a unique, negative contribution to responding. We discuss the implications of these findings for efforts to nurture the development of cognitive self‐regulation and school readiness during early childhood.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ford Ruth M; McDougall Sine J.

Both programs, including the shortened version, significantly improved cognitive test scores by about one quarter of a standard deviation relative to the control group at the end of the year. The shortened version of the program was equally as effective as the academic- year program because most of the gains in the academic-year program occurred within the first few months.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: Preschool group, Kinderprep group and no treatment control.

present the results of a novel early childhood intervention in which disadvantaged 3-4-year- old children were randomized to receive a new preschool and parent education program focused on cognitive and non-cognitive skills (CogX) or to a control group that did not receive preschool education. In addition to a typical academic year (9 month) program, we also evaluated a shortened summer version of the program (2 months) in which children were treated immediately prior to the start of Kindergarten. Both programs, including the shortened version, significantly improved cognitive test scores by about one quarter of a standard deviation relative to the control group at the end of the year. The shortened version of the program was equally as effective as the academic- year program because most of the gains in the academic-year program occurred within the first few months.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: Preschool group, Kinderprep group and no treatment control.

article presents the continued effects of a home-based intervention programme on child development outcomes and parenting practices in Bahrain. The intervention is the Mother–Child Home Education Programme (MOCEP) which was implemented in Arabic in the Kingdom of Bahrain beginning in 2001. One hundred and sixty-seven poor, disadvantaged families were randomly recruited from the 1996 birth cohort; 92 families for the home intervention group and 75 families for the control group. Data were collected over two subsequent testing intervals in 2004 and 2008 when the children were in Primary II and Primary VI levels, respectively. Several child development outcomes and parenting practices and belief measures were compared. Impact study results immediately following the intervention yielded the highest effects on outcomes, and these findings are reported elsewhere. This study reports the effects sustained on some child development outcomes and parenting beliefs well into primary school.","Comments":"Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hadeed Julie ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2010.524299","Keywords":"home-based intervention\r\nchild development\r\noutcomes\r\nparenting\r\neffects\r\nBahrain\r\nworld","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hadeed Julie (2011) The continued effects of home intervention on child development outcomes in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

This model sought to enhance student performance by redefining school as the extended family for urban students and parents. A 4-year study concluded that when parents were involved with this process, student achievement and parental commitment to education far surpassed that of students and parents who remained in the more traditional school setting.","Comments":"MDE: Please code FAST students vs same school controls for Classroom 1.

Mothers in one group read to their children at least 15 minutes a day from a variety of picture story books considered appropriate for this group of children. The other group of children had the opportunity to take home toys from a toy library, but mothers were not asked to work with the children. As measured by a picture vocabulary test, the children experiencing the reading program made significant gains as compared to the group utilizing the toy library.

present study was conducted to investigate the effect of family literacy programs on developing kindergarten children’s early literacy skills in Qatar. Three hundred and twenty kindergarten children (166 girls and 154 boys; mean age = 4.721 years) participated in the study. The sample was divided into two groups: the experimental group with (162) children whose parents participated in family literacy programs and the control group with (158) children whose parents did not participate. For the purpose of the study, the researchers designed an early literacy test that included five literacy skills: concepts of print, phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary, and emergent writing. The children in each group were pre-tested and post-tested. The findings indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the two groups as children in the experimental group had higher scores in the early literacy test compared to the control group. Among the sample studied, boys’ and girls’ early literacy scores were not markedly differentiated. Furthermore, the findings indicated that there was no difference due to the interaction between group and gender. In light of these results, recommendations for establishing family literacy programs in Qatari kindergarten settings are addressed.","Comments":"MDE: Results are presented for girls, boys and total. Please use total scores. \nESDE:Please use vocabulary as the primary outcome and writing as secondary.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ihmeideh Fathi ; Al-Maadadi Fatima ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105462","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ihmeideh Fathi, and Al-Maadadi Fatima (2020) The effect of family literacy programs on the development of children’s early literacy in kindergarten settings.

Each family received an explanatory letter from the district administration outlin- ing the program and met with the intervention teachers individually to learn about the scope and intention of the program (only three parents refused to participate). Parents were invited to an evening meeting where the program was further explained and the proposed process of parental involvement outlined. At that meeting an overview of the year's program and an explanation of the research principles involved were given. Concurrently, control families were informed that the project was being carried out, and all agreed to allow their children to be tested as part of a comparison group. The parent training sessions were organized in five 1-month units; in each unit a parent coaching session was led by a trained parent educator, working from a scripted discussion outline to assure fidelity across schools. All relevant information was also included in a take-home guide so that the concepts addressed in the sessions could be reviewed at will. Each parent education session was followed immediately by opportunities to en- gage in structured parent-child activities designed to pro- vide practice in the desired interaction. Each of the subsequent 3 weeks, the teachers sent home a set of scripted activities incorporating the principles that were the focus for that month. These structured activities in- cluded scripted interactions and demonstrations of how to engage children in extended discussions surrounding a book. Each book to be used in the at-home activities was specifically selected because its content and text design offered lexical richness, extended discourse opp\"\n\"ties, and interesting ideas to talk about. Thus, the scripted parent-child interactions fostered the types of high-quality language interactions that research has shown to be ef- fective in promoting language development. The se- quence, including a parent education session during which literacy activities were modeled and opportunities to practice those activities with the child were given and then scripted activities that were sent home from school every week, was repeated for each of the five interven- tion units.

year long intervention project was carried out with 248 kindergarten students, composed of 71 students in a control group and 177 students whose parents participated in an experimental program that included parent education sessions, at-school parent/child activities, and at-home book-mediated activities. The intervention, Early Access to Success in Education (Project EASE), was designed to increase the frequency and quality of language interactions through book-centered activities and to give parents information about and opportunities for engagement in their children's developing literacy abilities. Parents received information about ways to strengthen vocabulary, extend narrative understanding, develop letter recognition and sound awareness, produce narrative retellings, and understand exposition. Measures of home literacy support were collected from parents and a battery of language and literacy tests were adminis- tered to intervention and comparison children prior to the intervention and at its conclusion. Children whose families engaged in the at- school and at-home activities made significantly greater gains in language scores as measured on subtests of vocabulary, story comprehension, and sequencing in story-telling than comparison children. The greatest gains were found in those low-achieving students who started out with low language skills at pretest and strong home literacy support. Parents in general showed high levels of par- ticipation in the prescribed activities, and they reported high levels of satisfaction. The study demonstrates the potential for schools to engage parents in a meaningful way in supporting their children's literacy development, and the sensitivity of children's oral language skills to the impact of structured enrichments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jordan Gail E; Snow Catherine E; Porche Michelle V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1598/RRQ.35.4.5","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nFamily Literacy\r\nEmergent Literacy\r\nPrimary Education\r\nBeginning Reading\r\nKindergarten Children\r\nKindergarten\r\nProgram Descriptions\r\nParent Participation\r\nParent Student Relationship\r\nProgram Effectiveness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jordan Gail E, Snow Catherine E, and Porche Michelle V (2000) Project EASE: The effect of a family literacy project on kindergarten students' early literacy skills.

investigation examined the efficacy of a home-based book reading intervention program for enhancing parents' use of print-referencing behaviors and for stimulating children's early literacy skills in the areas of print and word awareness. Participants included 28 parents and their typically developing 4-year-old children. Each dyad was assigned to a control or experimental group, using a pretest-posttest control group research design. Pretest measures of parents' book-reading behaviors and children's early literacy skills were collected. Each dyad then completed a home-based shared reading program, in which they read two books each week over a 4-week period. Parents in the experimental group were instructed to use nonverbal and verbal print referencing behaviors in their reading sessions. Control group parents did not receive this instruction. Posttest measures found that parents in the experimental group showed a significant increase in their use of verbal and nonverbal references to print. Results also indicated that parental use of these print referencing behaviors significantly enhanced their children's early literacy skills in several areas of print and word awareness. Clinical implications of this intervention are discussed.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Parent Readiness Education Project (PREP) on readiness skills and subsequent performance of preschool children.\n\nProcedures. This was an ex-post-facto study using summative evaluative procedures. Seven hundred and thirty-six students from the Ballard, Eastside, Ellis, Howard, and Oak Manor elementary schools in the Niles Community School District, Niles, Michigan, were used in this evaluation. All the subjects had participated in the Title III federally funded PREP screening program which selected those students with anticipated learning problems for PREP training. Two hundred and fifty-nine children received PREP training.\n\nOne-way analysis of variance and one-way analysis of covariance were used to analyze the results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, Caldwell Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills subtests. Simple t-test for independent means and correlated means were used to analyze the pretest and posttest scores of the Caldwell Preschool Inventory.\n\nResults. With the exception of the first annual group, the PREP students made significant gains in readiness skill areas in comparison to the Non-PREP and Non-Accepting PREP students. Follow-up studies at the end of kindergarten right through fourth grades continued to show significance in favor of the PREP group. In almost every case the PREP students had at least caught up with the Non-PREP students, and scored significantly higher than the Non-Accepting PREP group. However, for the first annual group the PREP students failed to close the gap between them and the Non-PREP in nine cases on the CTBS Subtests. Furthermore, they did not surpass the Non-Accepting PREP group in four subtests.\n\nConclusion. The parent-involvement variable of the PREP program is an important factor affecting the readiness skills and performance of preschool children. As a program for early identification and an intervention of learning problems, PREP is an effective project worthy of wider application.","Comments":"ESDE: Use Grade 1 outcomes on CTBS for Groups A, B and C.

Ninety low socioeconomic status preschoolers and their mothers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) e-book reading; (2) printed book reading; (3) regular kindergarten literacy program (control). Mothers of children in the intervention groups received guidance on how to read to their child, and had five sessions of reading within a period of two weeks. The final session was videotaped and transcribed. Children in both intervention groups showed significant progress in word comprehension and phonological awareness compared to the control group. Children's initial knowledge in each skill and both interventions contributed to language progress more than maternal education, frequency of shared book reading and computer use. The authors conclude that parents and children may expand their shared book reading experience to include e-books, which may serve as promising contexts for developing young children's language. © The Author(s) 2013.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: (1) e-book reading; (2) printed book reading; (3) regular kindergarten literacy program (control).

Also parents' concerns about the dialogical storybook reading technique and the techniques effects on parent-child relationship were investigated with the study. Quantitative data were gathered to investigate the impact of the technique on children's receptive vocabulary development and their parents' self-efficacy for storybook reading. Qualitative data were used to examine the concerns of the parents about the technique and the impacts of the technique on parent-child relationship. Pre-test post-test with control group design was recruited for the quantitative part of the study. Participants were 40 Turkish parents and their preschooler children. Children receptive vocabulary measured with Turkish version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). Investigator developed Parents' Self-efficacy for Storybook Reading Questionnaire to measure parents' self-efficacy for storybook reading. After the pre-testes participants randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Experimental group received dialogical storybook reading training. Seven weeks after the training post-testes were administered to the participants. Paired t-tests and analysis of variance (ANCOVA) were used to examine the impacts of the technique on children's receptive vocabulary development and their parents' self-efficacy for storybook reading. Findings show that after the dialogical storybook reading training experimental group parents' self-efficacy for storybook reading significantly increased. Concurrently control group parents' self-efficacy for storybook reading stayed same between pre-test and post-test. There were no significant difference between post-tests scores of control and experimental group for self-efficacy for storybook reading. Receptive vocabulary of experimental children significantly increased from pre-test to posttest. However such increase did not appear for children in control group. Comparison of post-tests results of two groups revealed that experimental groups' receptive vocabulary levels were significantly higher than the control group. Qualitative data were gathered through in-depth interviews with 15 parents from experimental group to examine the concerns of parents about dialogical storybook and the impact of the technique on parent-child relationship. Data analyzed through the principles of grounded theory. After the transcription of the interviews open codes were derived from the transcription. Open codes grouped under axial codes and analyses of axial codes leads to final themes. Two major concerns of the parents about the dialogical storybook reading were: change in parental role in storybook reading, and importance of parents' previous joint storybook reading experiences. Also parents reported three major impacts of the technique on parent-child relationship. The three major impacts are: unique activity sharing more time, democracy in family, and need for consistency between parents.","Comments":"Please use PPVT as the main outcome.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Kotaman Huseyin ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kotaman Huseyin (2007) Impacts of dialogical storybook reading on children's receptive vocabulary development and their parents' self-efficacy for storybook reading. , The Pennsylvania State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414636,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"Parent Training[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kraft etal_2001.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414636,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"When parents arrived for the two-\nhour training session, they were provided a 10-\npage parent guide that outlined the reading pro-\ncedures the parents should use with their chil-\ndren.

purpose of this study was to examine the effects of teaching parents to deliver a carefully sequenced reading program to their kindergarten children who were not receiving formal reading instruction in school. Forty-five children and their parents enrolled in a kindergarten in a university-sponsored primary school participated in the research. Approximately twice as many children who participated in the home reading program scored in the top quartile of the Woodcock Reading Mastery (WRMT-R) word identification and word attack subtests as might be expected based on the test norms, while the children in the control group approximated the expected norms. On curriculum-based measures, the average score of children in the home reading group was higher than 87% of the children in the control group. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that a significant proportion of the variance in children’s posttest performance was associated with their pretest scores on the WRMT-R letter identification subtest scores, their knowledge of the phonemes introduced in the curriculum and the consistency with which their parents implemented the home reading program.\rThe results are discussed relative to previous research in which teachers implemented the curriculum and the issues associated with utilizing parents as primary beginning reading teachers. In addition, limitations of this research and suggestions for future research are provided.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kraft Benjamin Lignugaris; Findlay Penny ; Major Julie ; Gilberts Guy ; Hofmeister Alan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nReading Research\r\nPrimary Education\r\nReading Skills\r\nProgram Implementation\r\nBeginning Reading\r\nKindergarten\r\nReading Instruction\r\nParent Participation\r\nParents as Teachers\r\nHome Instruction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kraft Benjamin Lignugaris, Findlay Penny, Major Julie, Gilberts Guy, and Hofmeister Alan (2001) The association between a home reading program and young children's early reading skill.

paired reading program was implemented for 195 Hong Kong preschoolers (mean age = 4.7 years) andtheir parents from families with a wide range of family income. The preschoolers were randomlyassigned to experimental or waitlist control groups. The parents in the experimental group received 12sessions of school-based training on paired reading in 7 weeks. They were required to do paired readingwith their children for at least four times in each of these 7 weeks. At the end of the program, the pre-schoolers in the experimental group had better performance in word recognition and reading fluencythan their counterparts in the control group. They were also reported as more competent and motivatedin reading by their parents. More importantly, the program had many favorable effects on parents. Par-ents in the experimental group had higher self-efficacy in helping their children to be better readers andlearners. They also reported that they had better relationships with their children. Their changes in rela-tionships and self-efficacy were found to mediate the program impact on some of the child outcomes.However, family income did not moderate the effectiveness of the program. Families with high andlow income both benefited from the program alike.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lam Shui-fong ; Chow-Yeung Kamfung ; Wong Bernard P.H; Lau Kwok Kiu; Tse Shuk In; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2012.12.003","Keywords":"Paired reading\r\nParental involvement\r\nPreschoolers\r\nFamily income\r\nParenting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lam Shui-fong, Chow-Yeung Kamfung, Wong Bernard P.H, Lau Kwok Kiu, and Tse Shuk In (2013) Involving parents in paired reading with preschoolers: Results from a randomized controlled trial.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Healthy Start Home Visiting Program—School-Based Model (HSS), using a cluster randomized controlled trial design. Methods: Participants included 224 parents from 20 preschools randomized into intervention and wait-list control groups at the preschool level. Furthermore, 105 parents from the participating preschools were trained as parent ambassadors to assist in program delivery. They were randomized into intervention and control groups at the preschool level. Outcome measures included parent and teacher reports on children’s learning, parent report on children’s behavior and health, their own parenting, and direct assessment of children. Parent ambassadors completed measures on parenting and their children’s behavior before training and after program delivery. Results: There was significant improvement at postintervention in parenting, children’s behavior, and learning and health in the intervention group, compared with the control group. Conclusions: The results provided evidence on the effectiveness of the HSS program.","Comments":"Please focus on comparing pre- vs. post-intervention scores","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Leung Cynthia ; Tsang Sandra ; Heung Kitty ; Tam Mia ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1049731518786578","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Leung Cynthia, Tsang Sandra, Heung Kitty, and Tam Mia (2019) Healthy start home visiting program—School-based model: Cluster randomized controlled trial.

Parents in three groups (119 mothers, 5 fathers) were coached to mediate child learning, respectively, in: interactive storybook reading, writing, or visuomotor skills. A group-specific workshop was followed by 7 weeks of tri-weekly structured dyadic interactions and weekly tutorial home visits. A fourth group (control) received no intervention. Results showed implementation success: Mothers coached in interactive storybook reading or writing mediation improved in the coached activity from pretest to immediate posttest and to delayed posttest. Interactive storybook reading improved less for older than younger children, whereas writing mediation improved more for older than younger children. No transfer emerged from one activity to the other: Coaching on reading had no effect on writing or visuomotor skills, and coaching of writing had an effect only on writing. Children’s alphabetic skills were enhanced in the writing mediation-coached group, whereas linguistic competencies, unexpectedly, were not enhanced in the interactive storybook reading-coached group. The significance of writing mediation as a dyadic activity promoting literacy is emphasized.","Comments":"Coders, please combine scores from all 3 interventions ((interactive storybook reading, writing, or visuomotor skills) vs. control and focus in coding pretest vs. immediate posttest scores.\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Levin Iris ; Aram Dorit ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11145-010-9254-y","Keywords":"Language and Literature\r\nPsycholinguistics\r\nEducation, general\r\nNeurology\r\nLiteracy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Levin Iris, and Aram Dorit (2012) Mother–child joint writing and storybook reading and their effects on kindergartners’ literacy: An intervention study.

effects of an interactive shared-reading intervention were evaluated with 3-to 4-year-old children from low-income families who attended subsidized child care. The children entered the program with oral language skills that were significantly below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) no treatment control, (b) a school condition in which children were read to by their teachers in small groups, (c) a home condition in which children were read to by their parents, and (d) a combined school plus home condition. Parents and teachers were trained in a specific form of interactive reading via an instructional videotape. The intervention was conducted for 6 weeks, after which children were posttested on standardized measures of oral language, and language samples were obtained during a shared-reading assessment. Significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and were largest for children in conditions involving home reading.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

study examined the effects of preschool reading intervention procedures on the knowledge about reading (reading readiness) of the subjects as they entered kindergarten. One such intervention, carried out for two consecutive years, involved giving low and middle income parents packets of several small, easy-to-read books and guidelines for using them with their children when the parents brought their children for preschool screening provided by the school districts in the spring. Children in the first wave (year one) of the study received two additional packets of books by mail during the summer, and children in the second wave (year two) received only the packet at the screening. Children who came to kindergarten the following fall were then tested, and the results were compared with those of control classmates who had received no materials. The first year students were tested at the beginning and end of the year. Year 2 students were tested only in November. A three-variable model (gender, picture vocabulary test score, and treatment type) was used to predict end-of-kindergarten scores on knowledge of words, letters, spelling, and story. Analyses of the reading knowledge of the first year students indicated reliable and longlasting effects of the treatment. The treatment affected not only story reading but also word reading and spelling. Year 2 students showed a smaller instructional effect when compared with control students. Children's story reading was affected by the treatment, but not word reading or spelling. The diminished effect could be explained by either the earlier posttesting date or the provision of fewer materials.","Comments":"We did not find the paper refered in the meta-analysis but we found the report of the paper: McCormick & Mason, 1984.\rMDE: Please code Wave 1 and Wave 2.\rESDE: Please code for Wave 1 and Wave 2 - full data in Tables at end of report.

The sample consisted of 60 mothers paired with their three or four year old children who attended full day preschool. The families were randomly assigned to one of three groups for a twelve week period. The tests used in the study were the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test; the Cultural Language Test—Mean Length of Utterance; the Cultural Language Test—Standard English; and the Conversation—Mean Length of Utterance Measure. Three major findings result from the study: 1. The children of mothers provided with intensive training and practice (Group 1) scored significantly higher on all four tests than did the children whose mothers received minimal help (Group 2) or children whose mothers received no help at all (Group 3). 2.

The current study attempted to enlarge the original study's sample size, include kindergarten students in the program, and determine the optimal length of training time for parents needed. Additionally, data gathered from the parent participants were analyzed including parent' s perceptions of the program, their confidence level in tutoring their child, and the parents' level of mastery of the concepts of tutoring before working with their child. At the beginning of the school year, 36 kindergarten parent-student dyads and 52 first grade parent-student dyads were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or the control group for an 1 1-week study. Parents in the first treatment group received one hour of training and parents in treatment two received two hours of training. Students in both treatment groups received homework material published by Scholastic (Padak & Rasinski, 2005) consisting of poems and differentiated emergent and beginning reading activities and materials. Parents in the control group did not receive training and the students in the control group received poems to take home without the activities. Fall pretest scores from Dynamic Indicators of Basic Literacy Skills (DIBELS) were compared to winter DIBELS scores. Raw score results did not show statistically significant reading gains for the treatment groups, however, more growth was evident in the treatment groups when the instructional recommendation level for each student and their level of being at risk was considered. Parents and students had favorable comments about the program. Parents receiving two training sessions had a higher level of confidence to tutor their child than those who attended only one session.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 arms: a) parental training for 1 hour, b) parental training for 2 hours, c) control.

Children assessed on two standardized reading tests showed statistically significant differences after 6 months, but these differences later disappeared. When analyses were limited to those pairs of children in which the parent of the experimental group child had participated more completely in the tutoring program, there were both immediate and long-term statistically significant differences between the groups. It is concluded that parent tutoring programs can be an effective supplement to compensatory education programs but a substantial number of parents do not participate in such programs. The failure to account for degree of participation in previous research on parent involvement may account for the contradictory findings often reported.","Comments":"SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - Compensatory Education 1978ER5 3164ER5 1967 3150; 6848ER5 7603ER5 3831ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 3947ER5 6823 3932 8016 4542 7577 3816; Parent Participation 7576ER5 7641ER5 912ER5 7550 7615 909; 8208ER5 3366ER5 3382ER5 3164ER5 3098ER5 8179 3352 3368 3150 3085; Reading Difficulties 8667ER5 8264ER5 8635 8234; 8676ER5 5016ER5 8644 4999; Reading Instruction 8678ER5 5259ER5 8646 5242; 8693ER5 5811ER5 9726ER5 1ER5 8655ER5 11271ER5 8661 8623 11225 1 5792 9690; 8835ER5 8832ER5 5259ER5 8678ER5 8654ER5 6120ER5 5771ER5 8803 8800 5242 8622 5752 6101 8646; Tutoring 11099ER5 5074ER5 5259ER5 11055 5057 5242\rCODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

From a sample of 40 Newfoundland schools, schools were grouped into rural village (drawing students from one small community), rural collector (drawing students from several small communities), and urban, and four schools were randomly selected from each grouping. Schools were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups (Little Books used in the home only, LittleBooks used in the home and school, Little Books used in the school only, and control). Complete pretest and posttest data were obtained for 309 children. Quantitative analyses showed the children entering kindergarten in this study to be at risk of school failure. On average, urban kindergartners scored higher on all measures, and village and collector students scored about the same. Differences in posttest means were not related clearly to treatment. However, the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Pretest x Treatment interaction, which showed that the lowest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they were used at home only, and the highest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they used them in school only, helps to support the hypothesis that the home has a crucial role to play in literacy development. (Three tables of data are included and 16 references are attached.)","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

From a sample of 40, schools were grouped into rural village(drawing students form only one small community), rural collector (drawing students form a number of small communities), and urban. From each of these groupings, four schools were randomly selected. From each group of four, schools were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups (Little Books used in the home only, Little Books used in the home and school, Little Books used in the school only, and control). Eighteen classes of kindergarten children from 12 schools participated in the study.Complete pretest and posttest data were obtained for 309 children. Quantitative analyses showed the children entering kindergarten in this study to be at risk of school failure. On average, urban kindergartners scored higher on all measures, and village and collector students scored about the same. Differences in posttest means were not related clearly to treatment. However, the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Pretest x Treatment interaction, which showed that the lowest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they were used at home only and the highest achieving students when they used in school only, helps to support the hypothesis that the home has a crucial role to play in literacy development.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

retention has been the de facto policy for children with academic difficulties in many Latin American countries [Schiefelbein, E., & Wolff, L. (1992). Repetition and inadequate achievement in Latin America’s primary schools: a review of magnitudes, causes, relationships, and strategies. Washington, DC: World Bank.]. In Costa Rica, 14.9% of public school children were retained in first grade in 2002. In a study of first grade classrooms in Costa Rica, children identified as in need of repeating first grade were found to have lower levels of reading ability [Rolla San Francisco, A., Arias, M., Villers, R., & Snow, C. (in press). The importance of reading skills, prereading skills, and family in teachers’ decisions to retain children: a case study in costa rica. Aula Abierta]. There has been a greater focus in recent years on the importance of prevention of educational difficulties, versus repetition, as the most cost-effective and efficient way of providing educational opportunities to low-income children. There is little rigorous research evaluating the impact of different interventions on the early literacy skills of low-income children in developing countries as a way to prevent posterior academic difficulties. This experimental study evaluated the differential impact of three early literacy interventions—tutoring, classroom activities, and work with families—on the emergent literacy skills of low-income Costa Rican kindergarteners. Tutoring or a combination of all three interventions were the most effective, while providing high-quality materials to teachers without training had no impact, but more intensive interventions of longer duration will probably be needed to ensure long-term impact on first grade repetition and eventual school dropout. Continuing research will assess the impact of these interventions on student outcomes and repetition rates in first grade, as well as exploring the impact of the more intensive intervention of professional development.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 6 arms.

study evaluates the impact of a linguistic and cognitive development program for 5- year-old children. The program was implemented undergoing two conditions. In the first condition, the children participated in activities in their preschool classroom (extensive condition), while the second condition also involved family literacy activities in the children’s homes (intensive condition). The program’s impact was evaluated by using a pre-test – post-test design. The tests for receptive vocabulary (RV), category production (CP) and writing were administered to a sample of 214 children who participated in the intensive condition, 69 who participated in the extensive condition, and a control group of 49 children from Buenos Aires who did not participate in the program. The results showed that participation in the intensive condition led to a greater increase in RV, CP and writing abilities than the extensive condition and that both experimental conditions showed a greater increase in skill level when compared with the control group. The mother’s education level and previous preschool attendance seemed to have no effect. The results showed significant correlations between all of the variables analyzed and that the RV scores at the beginning of the year predicted both the RV and writing scores at the end of the year.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: the intensive condition (Group A), the extensive condition (Group B), the control group (Group C).

We present results from a randomized control trial evaluating a digital app (Measure Up!) and a parent companion app (Super Vision) designed to teach children measurement concepts, a skill that many teachers do not feel comfortable teaching. Ninety-nine 4- and 5-year-old children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Measure Up!, Super Vision + Measure Up!, or a control game. Analyses revealed a statistically significant effect of being in the treatment group (Measure Up! or Measure Up! + Super Vision) on children's posttest scores (about two additional questions correct), controlling for the pretest and demographic characteristics (gender, SES). In particular, gains were made for children's understanding of pan balances. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Results suggest that apps can be designed to help children learn important mathematics skills; however, more research needs to be done to understand how parent supports can be better designed.

childhood nutritional interventions typically combine nutritional and psychosocial stimulation. Such combined interventions result in long-lasting improvements of cognitive abilities in children who are malnourished. Here, we investigated potential cognitive abilities in normally developing children in Indonesia who were, however, at risk for suboptimal cognitive development due to little psychosocial stimulation in their home environment. In a randomized controlled intervention, children of the experimental group received nutritional supplementation combined with cognitive stimulation. Pre- and post-intervention measurements included cognitive development and functioning, behavior, and mother–child interaction. The experimental and control group received nutritional supplementation in the form of a fortified or unfortified milk powder, respectively. Additionally, the children and parents of the experimental group jointly engaged in daily learning activities at home and performed iPad-based tasks designed to foster cognitive abilities. The experimental group compared to the control group displayed a significantly higher increase in intelligence quotient as well as a significantly larger reduction in attentional problems after the intervention. These results indicate that low-level cognitive stimulation in combination with nutritional supplementation during early childhood can be an effective intervention that improves global cognitive functioning in healthy developing children.","Comments":"ESDE: WPPSI-IV composite scores as primary, reduction of attention as secondary outcomes (p.7, means & SEs)","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schneider Nora ; Geiser Eveline ; Gosoniu Laura M; Wibowo Yulianti ; Gentile-Rapinett Gertrude ; Tedjasaputra Mayke S; Sastroasmoro Sudigdo ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu10101394","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schneider Nora, Geiser Eveline, Gosoniu Laura M, Wibowo Yulianti, Gentile-Rapinett Gertrude, Tedjasaputra Mayke S, and Sastroasmoro Sudigdo (2018) A combined dietary and cognitive intervention in 3⁻5-year-old children in Indonesia: A randomized controlled trial.

The first workshop briefly discussed\nthe important role that parents play in supporting children's academic success and included a\nbroad overview of research evidence linking parental involvement to academic achievement.\nThe bulk of the workshop, however, was spent discussing parent-child shared book reading.\nThe workshop included a discussion on the role of shared book reading for children's reading\ndevelopment and information on how to choose books that support early reading acquisition.\"\n\"parents learned that shared\nbook reading is important for growth in children's vocabulary, general knowledge, and\ncomprehension, and children's increasing understanding of print concepts and syntactic\nstructure. The workshop presentation discussed how each of these skills is related to\nchildren's reading ability. The group also discussed the importance of creating a relaxed,\nsupportive environment during shared book reading, and that parents need to structure the\nbook reading experience so that children enjoy reading.\"\n\"To ensure that children are enjoying books, the workshop presented tips for choosing\n'good books' - books that children enjoy but are also useful for teaching phonological\nawareness and word reading. The workshop included information on the importance of\npattern, of repetitive phrases or words, of lyrical or rhythmic flow in the text, and of content\nthat appeals to children's interests.\nAt the end of the first session, the facilitator read each of the five books used for the\nchildren's camp program, demonstrating different characteristics of the books and different\ntechniques for shared reading. The techniques demonstrated how different types of books\ncould be used to support growth in children's vocabulary, general knowledge, and\ncomprehension, and children's understanding of print concepts and syntactic structure[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Seward_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416112,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 59:\n[¬s]\"Parents were encouraged to be 'expressive' readers so that, in addition to learning emergent\nliteracy skills, children also would be entertained by the book reading experience.\"\n\"The second workshop focused on phonological awareness specifically. This session\nincluded an explanation of phonological awareness and an explanation of its importance for\nreading acquisition. Parents learned that there were three types of phonological awareness\n(syllable, rhyme, and phoneme) that most often develop in sequence. Parents learned to\nrecognize their own child's level of phonological awareness and were shown how to focus\nchildren's learning at their current level.\"\n\"The second part of the workshop presented different types of phonological awareness\nskills. To demonstrate, the workshop facilitator described the phonological awareness items\nin the assessment battery. The test battery includes tasks where children are asked to identify,\nsegment, and blend phonological units. Parents also learned that other tasks, not used in this\nassessment battery, ask children to manipulate or substitute phonological units. Parents were\nasked to consider these types of activities (identifying, segmenting, blending, and\nmanipulating) when thinking of different phonological awareness activities for their own\"\n\"At the end of this workshop, parents worked in small groups to discuss the ways that\nphonological activities could be incorporated into home routines. After working in small\ngroups, parents presented different phonological awareness activities that they could perform\nat home. Working together with the facilitator, the group considered ways to modify\nchildren's favourite activities into 'phonological' activities, for example, while playing catch,\ntry to say another rhyming word each time you catch the ball; see how many rhyming words\nthe group can come up with in a row[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Seward_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416112,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 60:\n[¬s]\"At the end of the second workshop, the facilitator again stressed the importance of\nparents taking an active role in supporting their child's learning.

evaluate the influence of a summer intervention for children showing early signs of reading delay. The project evaluated two intervention components: a two week camp for children and two training workshops for parents. Data were collected for five groups of participants. Three groups participated in one or more intervention components: parent workshops only group, child camp only group, and both parent workshops and child camp group. All children who participated in the interventions were identified by teachers as having difficulty in phonological awareness and word reading skills at the end of senior kindergarten. Two additional groups served as comparisons. Children in the 'low' comparison group had early literacy skills similar to children in the intervention groups. The 'average' comparison group included children that were identified by teachers as normally achieving in early literacy. The intervention programs sought to improve children's word reading ability by providing explicit instruction in phonological awareness and opportunities to practice other emergent literacy skills. Children participated in pre- and post-test assessments measuring literacy skills and general cognitive skills. Children in all three intervention groups showed positive change following the intervention compared to a comparison group of children with similar initial abilities who did not receive any intervention. Children who received both intervention components showed the most positive change following a follow-up assessment at the end of grade one. The frequency of home literacy activities with parents was related to positive improvement in children's phonological awareness and word reading skills. The quality of home literacy activities is also thought to be important.

Parental engagement with children has beenlinked to a number of adaptive characteristics in preschoolers includinglanguage and literacy development, and family–school collaboration is animportant contributor to school readiness. This study reports the resultsof a randomized trial of a parent engagement intervention designed tofacilitate school readiness among disadvantaged preschool children, witha particular focus on language and literacy development. Participantsincluded 217 children, 211 parents, and 29 Head Start teachers in 21schools.

Parent use of the reading strategies at home\nwas supported and assessed in two ways during each week of the intervention: weekly phone\ncalls from the researcher and parent-completed logs. At each phone call, parents were asked\nthe number of times they were able to read with their child, whether they were encountering\nany problems and how the child enjoyed reading the book. They were reminded about the\nstrategies to use and asked to return the book with the log sheet at the end of the week in\norder to receive the next book.\"\n\"Parents recorded the number of times they read the book to the\nchild in the log sheet and could write down any comments about the reading sessions or the\nbook.

pragmatic randomised controlled trial was used to investigate the effects of two forms of shared reading on children's language and literacy skills. Parents of 80 children in the preparatory year of school participated in an eight-week home reading intervention. Families were assigned to one of three groups: dialogic reading (DR), dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing (DR + PR), or an attention-matched control group. Analyses of change from pre- to post-intervention showed significant effects for the DR and DP+PR groups compared to the control group on three of the six emergent literacy measures: expressive language, rhyme, and concepts about print. At three-month follow-up assessment, the two intervention groups maintained significantly better performance on the measure of concepts about print only. These findings illustrate the potential of a brief home-based intervention for promoting children's emergent literacy.","Comments":"There are 3 arms: a) dialogic reading (DR), b) dialogic reading + print reference (DR+PR), c) control.

improve the educational opportunities of U.S. children and adults by integrating community early childhood education and adult education for parents into a unified family literacy initiative. This document is the final project report of the National Evaluation of the Even Start Family Literacy Program, a 4-year effort designed to describe types of Even Start projects that were funded, the services provided, the collaborative efforts undertaken, and obstacles to implementation that were encountered. The 13 chapters discuss: (1) program background; (2) program design and evaluation; (3) in-depth descriptions of several participating literacy projects; (4) characteristics of program participants, projects, and staff; (5) participation in and amount of services; and (6) assessing effects of Even Start on participants. Effects discussed were those on children, parent literacy, parenting skills, and family life. Program cost is discussed, and a summary and conclusions of the evaluation are also presented. This summary notes that Even Start produced some positive short-term effects on children and adults, although those effects vary greatly across projects. On average, the resulting gains were no greater than those that similarly motivated families would obtain from locally available services. For Even Start to have a larger effect, the program would need to provide services more intensively.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"St Pierre R ; Swartz J ; Gamse B ; Murray S ; Deck D ; Nickel P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"St Pierre R, Swartz J, Gamse B, Murray S, Deck D, and Nickel P (1995) National evaluation of Even Start Family Literacy Program: Final report.

randomized experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of Even Start, a federally supported family literacy program providing early childhood education, adult education, parenting education, and joint parent-child literacy activities to children and parents from low-literate families. The evaluation of 18 Even Start projects followed 463 families for 2 years and found no statistically significant or educationally important impacts on Even Start families when they were compared with control families on child literacy outcomes, parent literacy outcomes, or parent-child interactions. The study concludes that Even Start projects were able to properly implement family literacy programs, and the observed lack of effectiveness is attributed to a combination of 2 factors: (a) a lack of full participation on the part of families and (b) instructional services that may be ineffective because of the curriculum content or the instructional approach.

Many low-income children exhibit a pattern of underachievement in school mathematics. Research has revealed a developmental gap between low-income preschool children and their middle-class peers with respect to the extent of their numerical knowledge. Research has also found that many low-income children do not receive a broad base of support for mathematical development at home or in preschool. In each of two studies, we conducted a bi-generation (parent and child) mathematics intervention with Head Start families. The intervention was designed to enhance parental support for pre-kindergarten children's mathematical development. It was found that low-income parents were willing and able to support this area of their children's development once they were provided with the training to do so. The support that parents provided to their children through the intervention was clearly effective in enhancing the development of children's informal mathematical knowledge. Intervention children developed more extensive mathematical knowledge than a comparison group of low-income children. Thus, an important step toward achieving the school readiness goal can be taken by fostering low- income parents' support for young children's mathematical development.","Comments":"Please code study 2","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Starkey Prentice ; Klein Alice ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15566935eed1105_7","Keywords":"world","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Starkey Prentice, and Klein Alice (2000) Fostering parental support for children's mathematical development: An intervention with Head Start families.

preschoolers rapidly acquire new information from social partners but do not learn efficiently from people on video. We trained parents to use Whitehurst’s dialogic reading questioning techniques while watching educational television with their children. Eighty-one parents coviewed storybook videos with their 3-year-old children in 1 of 4 conditions: dialogic questioning (pause, ask questions, and encourage children to tell parts of the story), directed attention (pause and comment but do not ask questions), dialogic actress (show the videos with dialogic questioning by an on-screen actress embedded in them), or no intervention (show the videos as usual). After 4 weeks, children in the dialogic questioning group scored higher than children in the directed attention and no-intervention groups on story comprehension and story vocabulary measures. Scores from the dialogic actress group fell in between. On a standardized measure of expressive vocabulary, children in the 2 parent-interaction groups exhibited significant improvement over their pretest scores. Results indicate that parent-led questioning enhances children’s learning from video stories at age 3 and that a video incorporating an on-screen dialogic questioner may also be effective. Mechanisms behind the effect of dialogic reading-style interventions are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: There are 4 conditions: a) dialogic questioning (pause, ask questions, and encourage children to tell parts of the story), b) directed attention (pause and comment but do not ask questions), c) dialogic actress (show the videos with dialogic questioning by an on-screen actress embedded in them), or d) no intervention (show the videos as usual).

At this meeting the aims of the project were outlined and a brief account of good practice when reading to children was given. A short video of a mother reading to her child was shown, which provided a basis for a discussion. The emphasis of the advice was to make reading an enjoyable experience for both mother and child, and to use it as an opportunity to extend their child's language skills. A booklet containing this advice was also given to the parents. After this meeting whenever the parents collected or delivered their child to the nursery class they were encouraged to choose a book together from a special display.

Low levels of literacy and high levels of behaviour problems in middle childhood often co‐occur. These persistent difficulties pose a risk to academic and social development, leading to social exclusion in adulthood. Although parent‐training programmes have been shown to be effective in enabling parents to support their children's development, very few parent interventions offer a combination of behavioural and literacy training. Aims. This paper (1) reports on a prevention programme which aimed to tackle behaviour and literacy problems in children at the beginning of school, and (2) presents the effects of the intervention on children's literacy. Sample. One hundred and four 5‐ and 6‐year‐old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods. This is a randomized control trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. The behavioural intervention consisted of the ‘Incredible Years’ group parenting programme combined with a new programme designed to train parents to support their children's reading at home. Results. Analyses demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on children's word reading and writing skills, as well as parents' use of reading strategies with their children. Conclusion. A structured multicomponent preventive package delivered with attention to fidelity can enable parents to support their children's reading at home and increase their literacy skills. Together with the improvement in child behaviour, these changes could improve the life chances of children in disadvantaged communities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sylva Kathy ; Scott Stephen ; Totsika Vasiliki ; Ereky‐Stevens Katharina ; Crook Carolyn ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1348/000709907X255718","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sylva Kathy, Scott Stephen, Totsika Vasiliki, Ereky‐Stevens Katharina, and Crook Carolyn (2008) Training parents to help their children read: A randomized control trial.

The effects of these programs are limited, partly because they appear to give insufficient guidance and support to parents in changing how they interact with their children. To increase the impact of family literacy programs, two ways to support parents in changing their interaction behavior were examined: active learning during parent group meetings (AL) and technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL). The effects on vocabulary were investigated in children involved in preschool education programs. In an experimental design with partially randomized clusters, 223 preschool children were enrolled in a family literacy program with AL, TL or in the control condition without a family literacy program. Results showed that children in the AL condition made larger receptive vocabulary gains than control children, whereas TL children showed similar gains to controls. Children in all three conditions made similar gains in productive vocabulary. These results demonstrate the strength of AL and shows the complexity of implementing TL.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: a) active learning during parent group meetings (AL), b) technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL), c) control.

The effects of these programs are limited, partly because they appear to give insufficient guidance and support to parents in changing how they interact with their children. To increase the impact of family literacy programs, two ways to support parents in changing their interaction behavior were examined: active learning during parent group meetings (AL) and technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL). The effects on vocabulary were investigated in children involved in preschool education programs. In an experimental design with partially randomized clusters, 223 preschool children were enrolled in a family literacy program with AL, TL or in the control condition without a family literacy program. Results showed that children in the AL condition made larger receptive vocabulary gains than control children, whereas TL children showed similar gains to controls. Children in all three conditions made similar gains in productive vocabulary. These results demonstrate the strength of AL and shows the complexity of implementing TL.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: a) active learning during parent group meetings (AL), b) technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL), c) control.

In the study a pre- post-test control group design was used. The data were obtained using the General Information Form, developed by the researchers, the Cognitive Process Skills Evaluation Form and Semi-Structured Interview Form. The study group consists of 60 children (30 in the experimental group, 30 in the control group) receiving preschool education in the spring semester of 2016-2017 academic year. The cooperative learning-based science education program with family involvement include activities such as eddies, shadows, mirrors, plants\\u0027 breathing, water power, etc. that can support scientific process skills of children. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22 package program. Since the data has no normal distribution, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for intra-group comparisons and Paired Sample t Test was used for inter-group comparisons. As a result of the study, a significant difference between experimental and control groups was found in favor of the experimental group in the development of scientific process skills of children. According to this result, it can be said that cooperative learning with family involvement-based education program supports the scientific process skills of children of 5-6 years of age. It may be suggested that cooperative learning with family involvement-based science education should be included and popularized in preschool education.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ulutaş Ayşegül ; Kanak Mehmet ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.14704/NQ.2018.16.11.1263","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ulutaş Ayşegül, and Kanak Mehmet (2018) Effect of the cooperative learning with family involvement based science education on the scientific process skills of 5-6-year-old children.

A total of 29 couples of mothers and their children were assigned to an experimental group (n = 16 couples) and a control group (n = 13 couples). Mothers in the experimental group participated in 12 weekly sessions and were trained how to enrich their daily parent-child interactions as such. Children’s cognitive performance was assessed by three subscales of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). The results of the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated a significant difference between the experimental and control group. The findings support the effectiveness of the parent training program for enhancing cognitive performance in preschoolers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vahidi Elahe ; Aminyazdi Amir ; Kareshki Hossein ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.5964/ejop.v13i3.1381","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vahidi Elahe, Aminyazdi Amir, and Kareshki Hossein (2017) The effectiveness of a parent-training program for promoting cognitive performance in preschool children..

paper reports the results of an intensive home-based educational intervention programme for 4- to 6-year-old children at risk of educational failure. The programme, Opstap Opnieuw (“Step-up Anew”), was developed in the Netherlands as an alternative to the well-known HIPPY-programme, of which a Dutch version was carried out in the early 1990s for ethnic minority groups, without apparent success. Building on the basic intervention strategy of HIPPY (i.e., involving mothers and paraprofessional aides), a new curriculum was developed based on recent theoretical insights in cognitive and language development, and emergent literacy and numeracy. The programme was carried out with Turkish and Moroccan immigrant families. For the Turkish group, the results were partly positive: There were modest effects of the programme on cognitive development and emergent numeracy, small effects on Turkish language development, but no effects on Dutch language development. In contrast, for the Moroccan group the effects were disappointing. The results are evaluated with respect to recent insights into effective strategies and essential ingredients of early educational intervention programmes.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 2 populations: Turkish and Moroccan.

The curriculum covered two years\r(effectively, 30 weeks in each year) and was presented to the\rmothers on weekly instructions and worksheets, which\rspecified activities for five days each week. In total, there\rwere 150 planned activities per year. Carrying out the daily\ractivities was estimated to take about 20 minutes each day. In addition to the worksheets, the programme provided all kinds of materials to be used in the activities, such as pencils,\rscissors, audiotapes with nursery rhymes and songs, and\rpicture books. Instructions to the mothers about how to carry\rout the activities were written on instruction sheets in clear,\rsimple language and, in view of the low literacy skills of many\rof the target mothers, supported by pictorial illustrations. For\rfully illiterate mothers, stories and songs were also made\ravailable on audiotape. Worksheets, instruction sheets,\rmaterials, books, and tapes were all attractively designed.\rPicture books were written by well-known authors of\rchildren’s books.\r\rThe mothers were supported by paraprofessional aides who\rwere to explain the worksheets and demonstrate appropriate\rinteractional behaviour. These paraprofessionals were experienced mothers themselves, belonged to the same communities as the target families, lived mostly in the same\rneighbourhoods, spoke their languages, but were on average\rslightly better educated. Paraprofessional aides were recruited\rlocally by the coordinators, from the Moroccan target group. They were usually known by the coordinators because of their active participation in the neighbourhood. They received an introductory training (8–10 days) and were further trained on the job by their local coordinator. According to the plan, the paraprofessionals visited the families every two weeks (planned number of visits: 15 in each year) or, alternatively, organised small group meetings in a nearby neighbourhood centre. In addition to instructing and supporting the mothers, the paraprofessionals were also asked to keep records of the actual implementation of the programme activities, thus being an essential instrument of the programme’s implementation strategy and implementation monitoring system.\r\rIn addition to the support by paraprofessionals, the programme also organised monthly group meetings (planned\rnumber of meetings: 12 per year) for the mothers in a\rneighbourhood centre, headed by the local coordinator. A\rportion of the group meetings was used for providing\radditional information on the worksheets. There was also time\rfor discussing general child-rearing themes brought in by the\rparents. However, the main purpose of the group meetings was to provide information about general principles of authoritative and emotionally supportive, sensitive-responsive interaction styles. A videotape showing a model mother-child interaction was used for demonstrating these principles.\rIn view of the fact that the target groups spoke different\rlanguages, the programme was made available in Dutch,\rTurkish, and standard Arabic.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"page 150: \rimprove school achievement in reading, writing, and math, and to reduce grade retention and referrals to special education.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"Please code for the Moroccan population only.

paper reports the results of an intensive home-based educational intervention programme for 4- to 6-year-old children at risk of educational failure. The programme, Opstap Opnieuw (“Step-up Anew”), was developed in the Netherlands as an alternative to the well-known HIPPY-programme, of which a Dutch version was carried out in the early 1990s for ethnic minority groups, without apparent success. Building on the basic intervention strategy of HIPPY (i.e., involving mothers and paraprofessional aides), a new curriculum was developed based on recent theoretical insights in cognitive and language development, and emergent literacy and numeracy. The programme was carried out with Turkish and Moroccan immigrant families. For the Turkish group, the results were partly positive: There were modest effects of the programme on cognitive development and emergent numeracy, small effects on Turkish language development, but no effects on Dutch language development. In contrast, for the Moroccan group the effects were disappointing. The results are evaluated with respect to recent insights into effective strategies and essential ingredients of early educational intervention programmes.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 2 populations: Turkish and Moroccan.

Prior to the onset of the program the\nparaprofessionals had been trained for a period of three weeks.\nThe tasks were presented in a simple, uniform style so that the mother\nunderstood their purpose and subsequently was able to teach them to her child.\nThe tasks consisted of:\n1. Name of the task -- title.\n2. Why? -- a simplified explanation of the purpose of the specific lesson, i.e.,\nwhat the child would learn and how both the child and the mother would benefit\nfxom it.\n3. What? -- references to materials necessary for teaching the specific lesson,\nsuch as paper, pencil, crayons, etc.\n4. How? -- step-by-step instructions as to the teaching of the specific lesson.\nSuggestions were made as to the kinds of questions a mother could ask the\nchild, and ways of arousing the child's interest in the learning of the new task.\n5. What else? -- this section suggested to the mother a variety of ways in which\nshe could add to and enhance the learning of a specific task. It allowed both the\nmother and the child to explore the many ways and situations in which newly-\nlearned tasks or skills could be applied.\nSome of the teaching ideas that were incorporated into the weekly tasks\nwere: development of concepts such as time and size; recognition of colors and\nshapes; familiarity with letters and number symbols, etc.\nThe presentation of the task was followed by a role-playing session in\nwhich the paraprofessional assumed the role of the child, the mother the role of\nteacher. The mother then had a chance to practise what she had just been\ntaught. This was followed by a general discussion of the previous week's task,\nthe general objectives of the program, and other related matters. An appoint-\nment was then made for the next visit and the mother was reminded to teach the\nnew task to her child during the following week, and if possible to repeat it more\nthan once. In addition, the mother was encouraged to involve the rest of the\nfamily in the new learning situation.

questions: (1) To what extent does a Head Start experience accelerate the rate at which disadvantaged preschoolers acquire cognitive skills? (2) Are the Planned Variation models, simply by virtue of sponsorship more effective than ordinary nonsponsored Head Start programs? and (3) Are some Planned Variation models particularly effective at imparting certain skills? The first chapter gives an overall picture of the Head Start Planned Variation study, while the second chapter summarizes data concerning background characteristics and distribution of test scores. Chapter 3 provides a general discussion of methodological issues and some of the major difficulties resulting from the study design. Chapters 4-7 attempt to present a picture of the pattern of overall effects of various programs through ranking analysis, residual analysis, analysis of covariance, and resistant analysis. The final chapters explore the question of whether the relative effectiveness of various programs is related to certain child background characteristics, such as sex, ethnicity, age, prior school experience, and mother's education. One major conclusion drawn as a result of the intermodel comparisons was that Head Start programs are quite homogeneous in their ability to promote general cognitive development.","Comments":"MDE: This report includes 11 programs that follow the Head Start.

of 4-year-olds attending Head Start were randomly assigned to an intervention condition, involving an add-on emergent literacy curriculum, or a control condition, involving the regular Head Start curriculum. Children in the intervention condition experienced interactive book reading at home and in the classroom as well as a classroom-based sound and letter awareness program. Children were pretested and posttested on standardized tests of language, writing, linguistic awareness, and print concepts. Effects of the intervention were significant across all children in the domains of writing and print concepts. Effects on language were large but only for those children whose primary caregivers had been actively involved in the at-home component of the program. One linguistic awareness subtest, involving the ability to identify the first letter and first sound of words, showed significant effects.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 June 2018","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Epstein J N; Angell A L; Payne A C; Crone D A; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.86.4.542","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Epstein J N, Angell A L, Payne A C, Crone D A, and Fischel J E (1994) Outcomes of an emergent literacy intervention in Head Start.

The videotape contained two assign- ments, described in Table 3. The procedures for the adult in Table 3 were presented as a set of rules and were followed by taped vignettes of adult-child book reading that exemplified those rules. Afinalsection of the videotape consisted of vignettes of inappropriate adult-child book reading. Teachers were asked by the trainer to criticize the readers in the vignettes in terms of the rules of dialogic reading and to indicate what the adult reader should have done differently in response to the child. Following the videotape, the trainer engaged in role play with the teach- ers being trained, which involved presenting various examples of child behavior and giving the teacher feedback on her use ofthe dialogic read- ing rules. The whole training sequence took about 30 min per trainee for Part 1 and 20 min for Part 2. Part 1 and Part 2 training were sepa- rated by 3 weeks. Teachers were trained during the school day. \"\n\" Parents were trained at their child's day-care center. Train- ing sessions were held in late afternoon, just before closing time.

effects of an interactive book reading program were assessed with children from low-income families who attended subsidized day-care centers in New York. The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 months behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (b) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (c) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests. These assessments were repeated at a 6-month follow-up. Educationally and statistically significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and follow-up on measures of expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: 1) school plus home condition, 2) school only, and 3) control.

effects, of an interactive book reading program were assessed with children from low-income families who attended subsidized day-care centers in New York. The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 months behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (b) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (c) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests. These assessments were repeated at a 6-month follow-up. Educationally and statistically significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and follow-up on measures of expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"MDE: Please code school reading as control group vs school reading + home reading as treatment group.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Arnold D S; Epstein J N; Angell A L; Smith M ; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.30.5.679","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Arnold D S, Epstein J N, Angell A L, Smith M, and Fischel J E (1994) A picture book reading intervention in a day-care and home for children from low-income families.

Positive effects at the end of Head Start obtained in the original study were replicated, and effects on emergent literacy skills in both cohorts were maintained through the end of kindergarten. Effects of the emergent literacy intervention did not generalize to literacy outcomes at the end of 1st and 2nd grades. Growth in emergent literacy skills and literacy skills from year to year was strongly influenced by variation in the Head Start centers and school districts attended by children in the sample.

to assess the influence of parental participation in school on the assistance parents could give their children outside of the classroom. A Parent Involvement Program was developed in the Mesa, Arizona Title I schools to help raise the consistently low reading readiness scores of the kindergarteners in these schools. A random proportional stratified sample was selected from 14 kindergarten classrooms in five of these schools: 40 students whose parents did not participate in the program and 40 students whose parents did participate. Parents received instruction twice a week in working effectively with their children,making reading games; and teaching in the kindergarten classroom one day a week. The Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on letter names was administered as a pre- and post-test (the Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on phonemes was also administered as a post-test).. Results showed that all children who were taught by the parents mastered the beginning skill of letter recognition, regardless-of-whether their- own parents-attended theParent Involvement Program. However, in the more difficult task of learning phonemes, the children whose own parents attended the program, learned more letter sounds than children whose own parents did not attend.(Cs)","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Woods C ; Barnard D P; Teselle E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Woods C, Barnard D P, and Teselle E (1974) The effect of parental involvement programs on reading readiness scores.

impact of a shared-reading program on the narrative skills of children from low-income families was examined. Participants in the study were 4-year-old children (N=123) enrolled in Head Start. Fifty-eight percent of the sample participated in a 30-week shared-reading intervention conducted in Head Start classrooms and homes. The remainder of the sample experienced the regular Head Start curriculum. The shared-reading intervention was found to have a significant effect on children's inclusion of evaluative devices in their narratives. Specifically, children who participated in the intervention program were significantly more likely to include references to internal states of characters and dialogue in their narratives at the end of the Head Start year than children who did not participate in the intervention program. This study adds to the growing experimental literature demonstrating that preschool literacy interventions can have a positive impact on the language skills of children from low-income families.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zevenbergen Andrea A; Whitehurst Grover J; Zevenbergen Jason A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0193-3973(03)00021-2","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zevenbergen Andrea A, Whitehurst Grover J, and Zevenbergen Jason A (2003) Effects of a shared-reading intervention on the inclusion of evaluative devices in narratives of children from low-income families.

study is a replication and extension of an earlier study, using a larger sample, a better measure of poverty status, and new longitudinal data. The study used path analysis to test hypothesized models of how the Parents as Teachers (PAT) program affects children’s school readiness and subsequent third-grade achievement. Participants were 5,721 kindergarten children who were chosen to be representative of all children beginning public school in the state of Missouri in the fall of 1998–2000. These children were subsequently located in the state’s third-grade test database 4–5 years later (82% of the original kindergarten sample). The causal models, which postulated both direct and indirect effects of PAT, were strongly supported by the data. Editors’ Strategic Implications: The findings add to the evidence that the PAT home visiting program holds promise as a primary prevention program. The authors demonstrate how parenting practices (including reading to children and enrolling them in preschool) promote both school readiness and subsequent academic achievement, but they also remind us of the pervasive effects of poverty.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use Table 7. Third grade achievement (statewise exams Communication Arts -MAP) Compare PAT+pre-school vs No PAT pre-school; then PAT no preschool vs No PAT no preschool (for Poverty) and the respective 2 comparisons for Non-Poverty. After you have produced 1 effect size for each of these 4 comparisons (therefore, 4 ES), take the fixed effects using the fixed-effect excel formula, to produce a Toolkit primary outcome ","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zigler Edward ; Pfannenstiel Judy C; Seitz Victoria ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/S10935-008-0132-1","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zigler Edward, Pfannenstiel Judy C, and Seitz Victoria (2008) The parents as teachers program and school success: A replication and extension.
