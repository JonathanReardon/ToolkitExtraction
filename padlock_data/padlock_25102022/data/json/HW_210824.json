The sample of this study consisted of 8\nclassrooms with an average of 24 students in each class. The 8 classes\nwere divided equally in terms of gender. The schools were selected\nconveniently, and the classrooms were randomly assigned into\nexperimental and control groups. The students in the experimental\ngroups received an instructional homework twice a week while students\nin the control groups received regular homework assignments. The\nexperiment lasted ten weeks and included 19 assignments and each\nassignment consists of a minimum of 20 items. This study used a\npretest posttest control group design. The results revealed that students\nin the experimental group (with IHT) scored significantly higher on the\nchemistry posttest achievement measure. The Eta squared for a posttest\nas a dependent variable for treatment was 0.15 which is partially high.\nThere was a significant statistical difference in term of gender with the\nUAE male tenth graders scored significantly higher than female\ncounterparts in the chemistry achievement test.

Recent attention has been given to specific ways parents can help increase student learning through their interactions with children as they complete home learning activities. It is important to note that the term parent is used interchangeably with the terms adult, guardian and family member. The term \"at-risk reader\" refers to readers who are at risk of failing school because of reading deficiencies. This report will examine whether parent training to increase parent-child interactions during the completion of second grade Interactive Homework Assignments (IHA) can facilitate increases in a student's ability to draw inferences from reading selections, a skill closely aligned with proficiency in reading acquisition. The second grade level was chosen because these children were those whose teachers were concerned with preparing them to take the third grade SAT9. Third grade level was not selected because many of their professional development activities were prescribed due to their immediate concern with preparing students to take the SAT9. IHA, for the scope of this study, is homework designed to increase parent involvement and student achievement. The results indicate that specific parent training during a brief period of time, approximately four weeks, has the potential for improving academic performance for academically at-risk students.","Comments":"CODERS: 3 groups: 1) Completed IHA + Parental training, 2) Completed IHA but no parent training, 3)  No IHA + no parent training. \nPlease code group 1 vs 3.

More particularly, we study the effectiveness of a web-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that a school offers to its students as optional homework, in a sample of 355 first-year secondary students, using an experimental design. The results show that whether students make this noncompulsory homework in the web-based ITS is dependent on their prior achievement and their teacher, and if they practice, they tend to choose easier modules. Students thus do not seem to optimize learning gains, but rather balance their perceived value of practicing and their \"expectancy,\" as found previously for regular (compulsory, non-ITS) homework. Regarding the value of choice, findings suggest that students may be poor judges of their most beneficial exercises pattern. Differentiation in ITS does not guarantee learning, unless scaffolding is tightly linked to it. In line with previous research, this research shows that practice does matter, though at varying intensities. Yet it also clarifies that motivation to make an effort is required, which adds to the lessons learned from homework research; both the perceived value and expectancy are at play and can be enhanced, for example, by teachers.","Comments":"ESDE: Use the coefficient from Specification 1 in Table 5 to calculate the ES, this can be standardized using the post test-SD from Table 2 (14.22).

The first video of each unit was broader in the content that was covered to give\nan overview of what was going to be studied in the unit. The following videos were more\nspecific and covered one or two topics for students to focus on. Some videos were “on-the-\nstreet” style where the instructor asked random participants in public places to participate in an\ninterview or engage in an activity. These videos are edited to emphasize specific common\nmisconceptions in the community and show methods of overcoming those misconceptions to\ngain a better understanding of the concept. Another type of video used in this study is a video\nlecture with the instructor lecturing and showing demonstrations.

in education that has become increasingly popular. Instructors who flip their classrooms reverse the roles of school work and homework by recording video lectures for students to watch before coming to class. Students then work on their homework in the classroom while the instructor is present to help them. Very little research has been done on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom to determine if students can perform better on exams by learning in a flipped classroom environment, especially for high school demographics. The purpose of this research is to add to the body of knowledge and help provide data to investigate how well students learn physics content by using the flipped classroom in a high school physics class and identify students' attitudes towards the flipped classroom. Seven periods of Physics with Technology at Lone Peak High School in Highland, UT were used in this study. Three of the classes were randomly assigned to be \"flipped\" while the other four were taught using what is considered a \"traditional\" method of instruction of physics, which is based on a guided inquiry method. The pacing and content was matched each day and all classes participated in the same labs, homework, quizzes and tests. The defining difference is the method which the content is covered. The flipped classes watched video lectures at home to learn the majority of the content, then did what is traditionally known as \"homework\" in class with the teacher present to help. In this study, it was found that there was no statistically or practically significant difference in mean test scores for the first three units in a high school Physics with Technology class. Student responses on a survey also showed very little statistically different in the students' attitudes towards the classroom environment in either instructional method.","Comments":"ESDE: Please combine the outcomes of the 3 end-of-unit tests. \n","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Bell Matthew R. author; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.14738/assrj.75.8259 ","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\nGenre/Form: Electronic dissertations.\r\nAcademic theses.\r\nAcademic theses.\r\nflipped classroom, inverted, instruction, education","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bell Matthew R. author (2015) An investigation of the impact of a flipped classroom instructional approach on high school students' content knowledge and attitudes toward the learning environment. , .

In this study, collaborative problem based learning (CPBL) supported by flipped learning, a blended learning design, was integrated into a high school bridge computer aided design curriculum. Ninety‐one 17‐year‐old students from two K11 classes were assigned randomly to an experimental group and a control group for the study, respectively. To assess the students' achievements and learning attitudes in the different groups, an 8‐week (16 h in total) pre‐ and post‐test quasi‐experimental study was designed. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the flipped learning approach. Significant differences were found between the experimental and control group in terms of students' achievements. In the experimental group, students' learning attitudes, motivation and self‐evaluation were enhanced. In conclusion, the results show that the flipped learning approach has a positive effect on the transfer of learning. Based on the findings obtained, recommendations for the improvement of future K12 engineering education instruction using the flipped learning approach are provided. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This action research study sought to bring about improvements in student engagement and performance in the secondary mathematics classroom through the implementation of the flipped model of instruction and compared student interaction in the flipped classroom to that of a traditional format. The flipped model of instruction is a relatively new teaching strategy attempting to improve student engagement and performance by moving the lecture outside the classroom via technology and moving homework and exercises with concepts inside the classroom via learning activities. Changes in the student participants' perceptions and attitudes were evidenced and evaluated through the completion of a pre- and post-survey, a teacher-created unit test, random interviews, and a focus group session. In addition, the researcher documented observations, experiences, thoughts, and insights regarding the intervention in a journal on a daily basis. Quantitative results and qualitative findings revealed the student participants responded favorably to the flipped model of instruction and experienced an increase in their engagement and communication when compared to the traditional classroom experience. The student participants also recognized improvements in the quality of instruction and use of class of time with the flipped model of instruction. In terms of academic performance, no significant changes were demonstrated between the flipped model of instruction students and those taught in a traditional classroom environment.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

There were a total 142 randomly-selected\nfirst-year algebra students. In each school, one teacher\ntaught one experimental class using spiral exploratory\nhomework and one control class using standard textbook\nhomework. No change in teaching style was required.\nEach homework method consisted of a series of\nexperimenter-constructed assignments based on the textbook\nused by all classes, Modern Algebra: Structure and Method,\nby Dolciani.\nStandard textbook homework consisted of problems\nselected from the textbook on the daily topic.\nSpiral exploratory homework consisted of 1) problems\nfrom the textbook on the daily topic and selected prior\ntopics, and 2) exploratory problems, devised by the\nresearcher, on the next topic to be studied.\nOtis-Lennon IQ scores were used to stratify the\nclasses into three ability levels— high, medium, and low.\nThe Mid-Year Algebra Test and a semantic differential\nattitude scale, the Senior High Attitude Inventory, were\nadministered in September, 1974 and January, 1975 to\nobtain pre and post-test achievement and attitude\nmeasures, respectively. The pre-test measures were used\nas covariates in unweighted-means ANCOVA done on the\nachievement and attitude data.\nA 2 x 3 factorial design was used crossing methods\nwith ability levels.\nAn item-analysis to determine the reliability of\nthe Senior High Attitude Inventory resulted in a computed\nalpha coefficient of 0.8705.\nResearch Findings\n1. There were no statistically significant differences\nbetween the two homework methods on gain in achievement.\nThe experimental group had a higher adjusted mean\nachievement score than the comparison group.\n2. There was no statistically significant difference\nbetween the two homework methods on gain in attitude\ntowards mathematics nor on gain in attitude towards\nmathematics as measured over the evaluative dimension\nof the Senior High Attitude Inventory.\n3. No statistically significant interactions emerged\nbetween homework method and ability level on either gain\nin achievement or gain in attitude.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Student Texas Primary Reading Inventory (TPRI) scores were obtained and analyzed for gains in score from the Middle of Year (MOY) and End of Year (EOY) administration. Parents were provided School Home Links Activity Guide Homework to use with their child on a weekly basis for twelve weeks. This group formed an experimental group. A control group did not receive SHL activity guide homework. For the control and experimental group each student's letter/sound score was entered into SPSS for the MOY and EOY TPRI, and average gains were calculated. Groups of students were isolated and analyzed for gain based upon participation in a district reading program, and/or high or low parental involvement in SHL activity guide homework. Research in the upper grades shows that homework completion and parent involvement positively affect student achievement. Students whose parents are involved in their education reap many benefits. These benefits include higher academic achievement (Davies, 1991). Fuller & Olsen (1998), Davies (1991), and Epstein (1995) believe parent involvement is a stronger indicator of student achievement than socioeconomic status, parent education, ethnicity, or any other indicator. The research supports the use of homework for upper grades. The results of this study remain inconclusive for kindergarten age students. This study shows that there is no statistically significant difference between experimental and control group kindergarten TPRI scores when homework is an independent variable.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Davis Jill Marie; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\nMajor Curriculum and Instruction\r\nGenre/Form: Academic theses.\r\nAcademic theses.\r\nreading\r\nparent involvement\r\nkindergarten","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davis Jill Marie (2004) The impact of parental involvement : a study of the relationship between homework and kindergarten Texas Primary Reading Inventory scores. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":511471,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 13:\n[¬s]\"The setting for this study was a rural, public middle school in northeastern Pennsylvania during\nthe 2015-2016 academic school year.

Two groups received a unit of instruction on Plate Tectonics, part of the Pearson Education Interactive Science Series. The control group received direct instruction in class; the experimental group received direct instruction outside class via teacher-created, prerecorded videos that students watched on Google Classroom. A small effect size was found related to the mean gains in the experimental group when compared to the mean gains of the control group. Post hoc testing revealed that students with IEPs had a significant difference in achievement when compared within and between groups. The results of this study may provide evidence that can inform decision-making processes with regard to effective technology-based instructional approaches and appropriate topics for professional development.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Duffy Colleen M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"\nEducation -- Research.\nEducation -- Research.\nWilkes University.\nGenre/Form: Academic theses.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Duffy Colleen M (2016) The impact of flipped learning on student achievement in an eight grade earth science classroom. , Wilkes University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":511736,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"he study adopted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom model.

A randomized controlled trial with 91 high school algebra students was conducted. The experimental group participated in a year-long intervention of the flipped classroom model while the control group followed the traditional lesson delivery. Results of the year-end evaluation of this model showed positive student perceptions. An analysis of covariance of the algebra post-test score with learning model as treatment factor and pre-test as covariate resulted in a significant treatment effect at .05 level of significance. A paired-sample t-test by treatment group to compare pre-test and post-test math attitude scores resulted in a significant decrease in the control groups’ value of mathematics while the experimental group had a significant positive change in their confidence and enjoyment of mathematics.","Comments":"(Sep 2016 : Lyon, France)","TypeName":"Book, Chapter","Authors":"Esperanza Peter ; Fabian Khristin ; Toto Criselda ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-45153-4_7 ","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Esperanza Peter, Fabian Khristin, and Toto Criselda (2016) Flipped Classroom Model: Effects on Performance, Attitudes and Perceptions in High School Algebra.

relationship between mathematics achievement and the instructional approach used (flipped versus traditional). A suburban school district located outside of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul implemented flipped learning instruction in one-half of all six elementary sites across the district. Half of the students in fifth grade mathematics classes received instruction via traditional lecture-style teaching methodology while the other half of the students received instruction via flipped learning instruction. Data was collected over three years time and a comparison of the quantitative results based on flipped versus non-flipped classes, differences between student groups as defined by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) subgroups, and differences between quartile rankings of students. Student growth was measured spring-to-spring using the NWEA MAP mathematics assessment. These findings are reviewed and flipped instruction growth in fifth grade mathematics classrooms was statistically significant in favor of flipped instruction overall. When defined by demographics flipped classroom students in the free and reduced price lunch program also outperform those in traditional instruction. This research is valuable to mathematics teachers, principals, administrators, curriculum directors, and math coaches in evaluating the further impact of flipped instruction as a means to integrate technology and personalize instruction for students.\"--Leaf 3.","Comments":"[St. Paul, MN] : [Bethel University] color illustrations) Typescript./ Includes bibliographical references (leaves 137-142). by Nathan Flansburg.

To be\nconsidered flipped learning, teachers must incorporate the four pillars of F.L.I.P.: flexible\nenvironment, learning culture, intentional content, and a professional educator (Flipped Learning\nNetwork, 2018).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Flick_2019.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"To improve mathematics achievement using the flipped classroom intervention","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215245,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215255,"AdditionalText":"inact classes watched the relevant lectures at home and discussed the content in class","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215276,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215412,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":511765,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 59:\n[¬s]\"The research took place at a suburban middle school within a public school district\nlocated in Missouri, United States of America.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Flick_2019.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215416,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"270","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":511765,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 61:\n[¬s]\"There were\napproximately 270 sixth-grade students enrolled in the middle school each year during both\nschool years.

The problem this study addressed is students in the United States of America are underachieving in mathematics education when compared to other first world countries. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to conclude if the implementation of flipped learning increases student achievement in sixth-grade mathematics in the middle school classroom. Two groups of students were used over the course of this study; Group One was taught using traditional teaching methods and Group Two was taught using both traditional and flipped learning methods. The qualitative study examined the opinions of teachers, parents, and students in regard to flipped learning using surveys, interviews, and panel interviews. The quantitative part of this study used achievement scores measured by a benchmark test created by the researcher and tested students five times over the course of the two school years while taking into account IEP, gender, and student placement. The benchmark scores were analyzed using an independent-samples t-test and an ANCOVA test, along with a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test for the Likert-scale survey questions. The ANCOVA test showed statistically significant measure regarding flipped learning for the benchmarks given in Quarter 1 [F(1, 202) = 54.45, p = 0], Quarter 2 [F(1, 202) = 8.799, p = 0.003], and Quarter 3 [F(1, 202) = 10.407, p = 0.001] for Missouri Learning Standard 6.EEI.A.3 (equivalent expressions). The qualitative research found positive results from parents, teachers, and students. Implications for policy and practiced included research-based professional development for teachers wishing to implement flipped learning and ensuring all students have access to technology at home and at school.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Flick Angela ;

conducted to determine the effects of homework on the achievement of high-school social studies students at Emporia High School, Emporia, Kansas during the school year 1983-84. Two instruments were administered to the students: (1) the Differential Aptitude Test, Verbal Reasoning subtest, Form T, and (2) a teacher-made multiple-choice social studies test. The sample contained 131 students from a total population of 1,181 students. Two instructors taught six intact American history classes that were randomly assigned to three groups: (a) 43 students in the preparation homework group, (b) 50 students in the practice homework group, and (c) 38 students in the no-homework group. A six week unit of instruction was identically taught to each group. The preparation homework group received homework before the class presentation covering the topic. The practice homework group received homework after the class presentation. The no-homework group did not receive any homework. An analysis of covariance (.05), a Multiple Classification Analysis, and Tukey's HSD (.01) were computed. Null hypotheses were tested. The findings of the statistical analyses were (a) there was no significant difference (.05) in achievement mean scores between females and males within groups, (b) there was a significant difference (.05) in achievement mean scores between students who were assigned homework and students who were not assigned homework, and (c) there was no significant difference (.01) in achievement mean scores between students who were assigned preparation homework and students who were asigned practice homework. Conclusions of the study were (a) factual content homework increased the students' achievement when compared to the students who were not assigned homework, (b) either preparation homework or practice homework can be assigned to students since both types of homework raise students' achievement when compared to the students who were not assigned homework, and (c) females and males achieved the same regardless of the type of homework assigned to them. Implications of this study were (a) time spent on factual recall homework does increase student achievement, and (b) preparation or practice homework should be assigned on the basis of teachers' goals, preferences, and teaching styles.","Comments":"MDE: Please code preparation HW vs No HW.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Foyle Harvey Charles; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education\r\nSecondary education\r\n0533:Secondary education","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Foyle Harvey Charles (1984) The effects of preparation and practice homework on student achievement in tenth-grade American History. , Kansas State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407105,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407107,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406861,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406866,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":646118,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 114:\n[¬s]\"Frequency Analysis for the DAT Scores\nof the Homework Groups[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Foyle_1984.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407034,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407037,"AdditionalText":"11%","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407109,"AdditionalText":"38","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407108,"AdditionalText":"50","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407119,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407153,"AdditionalText":"6","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406859,"AdditionalText":"differential aptitude test","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407104,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406980,"AdditionalText":"50","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406981,"AdditionalText":"16.32","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406982,"AdditionalText":"5.46","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406983,"AdditionalText":"27.6","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406984,"AdditionalText":"7.9","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406985,"AdditionalText":"38","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406986,"AdditionalText":"14.47","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406987,"AdditionalText":"4.66","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406988,"AdditionalText":"21.74","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406989,"AdditionalText":"8.75","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407038,"AdditionalText":"11","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407091,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407122,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407159,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215228,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"homework","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215240,"AdditionalText":"one condition is homework before the lesson and the other condition is homework after the lesson","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215253,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":646118,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 103:\n[¬s]\"The homework and class presentations related to the textbook used in the course: Todd & Curti, Rise of the American Nation (1977).

The purpose of this study was to determine if the technique of a flipped classroom, in which initial learning is done outside of the classroom and practice is done within the classroom, contributed to greater gains in student learning. There was one main question researched in this study: Do students in a flipped classroom show evidence of increased learning compared to those in a traditional classroom? The research was performed at a private Christian suburban high school with 25 students over a 4-week period. Data were collected using a pre-test and a post-test design and subsequently analyzed using independent-samples t tests. The results showed that while there was no statistically significant difference in gain scores between the control and experimental groups, the raw scores showed positive results in favor of the flipped classroom. The raw data produced other interesting trends, such as the fact that females seemed to respond better to the flipped classroom model than males and that the bottom and top third of the experimental class had higher gain scores than the control classroom. However, in order to investigate these phenomena and the overall effectiveness of the flipped classroom in secondary education, more research should be done. Keywords: flipped classroom, inverted learning, cooperative learning, high school math, student learning, technology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Freet Allison B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"\nFlipped classrooms.\nMathematics -- Study and teaching (Secondary)\nFlipped classrooms.\nMathematics -- Study and teaching (Secondary)\nGenre/Form: Academic theses.\nAcademic theses.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Freet Allison B (2016) Flipping the classroom : an exploration of the effect of inverted learning on student achievement in a high school mathematics classroom. , Wheaton College."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":7549342,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406853,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500280,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 13:\n[¬s]\"My intervention studied a flip of my regular level chemistry classroom.\"\n\"The intervention was carried out in two periods of general chemistry taught by\nmyself.

this investigation flipping was used to see if improvement occurred in achievement and with students' attitudes toward chemistry. Flipping means lecture content usually delivered in the classroom was instead presented through asynchronous videos via the internet in advance of class. This was done in a suburban high school chemistry course. Results from unit tests were analyzed to see the change in summative achievement; while student surveys and interviews were analyzed to see the change in students' attitudes toward chemistry. Results revealed no significant change in achievement with only marginal improvement in positive attitudes toward chemistry. Student comments and interviews showed that students did not have a positive response to using flipping to introduce new content but had a positive attitude towards using flipping in other roles.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Glynn J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Glynn J (2013) The effects of a flipped classroom on achievement and student attitudes in secondary chemistry.. , Montana State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":7549342,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 48:\n[¬s]\"The population that was studied came from a rural high school in the southern\nUnited States.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Howell_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 48:\n[¬s]\"The population that was studied came from a rural high school in the southern\nUnited States.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Howell_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407105,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 49:\n[¬s]\"The researcher had two classes of Physical Science Honors: The first class in the day\nwas designated as the traditional delivery or control class; the second was the inverted\ndelivery or experimental class.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Howell_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407107,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 49:\n[¬s]\"The researcher had two classes of Physical Science Honors: The first class in the day\nwas designated as the traditional delivery or control class; the second was the inverted\ndelivery or experimental class.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Howell_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 48:\n[¬s]\"The population that was studied came from a rural high school in the southern\nUnited States.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Howell_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407153,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 49:\n[¬s]\"The researcher had two classes of Physical Science Honors: The first class in the day\nwas designated as the traditional delivery or control class; the second was the inverted\ndelivery or experimental class.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Howell_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406849,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500292,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 49:\n[¬s]\"The students in the study were ninth-grade Physical Science Honors students.\nThe researcher had two classes of Physical Science Honors: The first class in the day\nwas designated as the traditional delivery or control class; the second was the inverted\ndelivery or experimental class.

In addition, perceptual data from students, parents, and the researcher were collected to form a complete picture of the flipped lecture format versus the traditional lecture format.\n\nThe researcher utilized a 4MAT learning cycle in two Physical Science Honors classes. One of these classes was traditionally delivered with lecture-type activities taking place inside the classroom and homework-type activities taking place at home; the other inverted, or flipped, delivered with lecture-type activities taking place outside the classroom and homework-type activities taking place inside the classroom. Existing unit pre and posttests for both classes were analyzed for differences in academic achievement. At the completion of the units, the flipped class students and parents were surveyed, and student focus groups were convened to ascertain their perceptions of the flipped classroom delivery model.\n\nStatistical analysis of posttest data revealed that there is no significant difference between the traditional lecture delivery format and the flipped delivery format. Analysis of perceptual data revealed six themes that must be considered when deciding to flip the classroom: how to hold students accountable for viewing the at-home videos, accessibility of students to the required technology, technical considerations relating to the video production, comprehension of the material both during and after viewing the videos, pedagogy of the overall flipped method, and preference for the flipped method overall.\n\nFindings revealed that students, parents, and the researcher all had a preference for the flipped class format, provided the above issues are addressed. The flipped class format encourages students to become more responsible for their learning, and, in addition, students reported that the hands-on inquiry activities done in class aided them in learning the subject matter. It is recommended, however, that before instructors decide to flip the classroom, they ensure that all students have access to needed technology, that there is a plan in place for ensuring that the students actually view the assigned videos, that they have a way to create the videos and ensure adequate quality, and that some discussion is held in class after each assigned video to ensure comprehension of the material.","Comments":"ESDE: Please combine the results of unit 1 and unit 2.\n","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Howell D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Howell D (2013) Effects of an inverted instructional delivery model on achievement of ninth-grade physical science honors students. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5023560,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":511883,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"all targeted girls in the two slum sites were listed.

The data involved in this study were collected between 2013 and 2015 from 748 12-19 years old primary school girls residing in two major Nairobi slums of Viwandani and Korogocho. These data were part of a larger intervention study that sought to improve schooling outcomes among girls from disadvantaged home backgrounds by providing them with after-school homework support, life skill mentoring and parental counselling. Results reveal intervention effects of between 23 and 26 mathematics score points on a Rasch scale with a mean of 400 a standard deviation of 100. These effects translate to at least one school term of learning for girls in the comparison group. Effect size for one of the intervention packages was small (0.24), while that of the second package was moderate (0.40).","Comments":"CODERS: Please code T2 vs C. \n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hungi Njora ; Ngware Moses ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/2331186x.2017.1290334","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\nForeign Countries; Low Income Groups; Urban Areas; Elementary School Students; Slums; Multivariate Analysis; Community Programs; Intervention; Mathematics Achievement; Disadvantaged Youth; After School Programs; Homework; Mentors; Counseling; Parents; Daily Living Skills; Program Effectiveness; Quasiexperimental Design; Surveys; Mathematics Tests; Scores\r\nKenya (Nairobi)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hungi Njora, and Ngware Moses (2017) Investigating the Effects of Community-Based Interventions on Mathematics Achievement of Girls from Low-Income Households in Kenya.

(Patterson, Reid, & Dishion, 1992) suggests that academic failure is both an outcome of disrupted parenting and a potential risk factor in the escalation of problem behavior. Therefore, improving academic success may serve as a protective factor against the escalation of antisocial behavior. Some research suggests that academic interventions are able to improve the academic performance of antisocial children. However, most of these studies have been conducted in restrictive settings such as special classes or juvenile detention centers. One potential method for improving a student's academic success in a less restrictive setting is to increase the student's engagement in school activities such as homework completion. This study investigated a model that suggested that an intervention aimed at increasing parental supervision of a routine study-time would improve the students' level of school engagement, as measured by attendance, homework completion, and homework accuracy, and that school engagement would account for a significant amount of variance in antisocial behavior, math performance, and social interactions. Subjects were 29 middle school iv students at risk for antisocial behavior because of low academic performance and teacher reports. Students and their parents were assigned randomly to an intervention group or a control group. The intervention consisted of four main components, a video-based instructional program establishing a routine study-time, parental monitoring of the child's routine study time, a home-school communication process using the teachers' voice mail and the students' school calendar, and ongoing support and consultation via weekly telephone calls to the parents. Results provided only partial support for the model. The treatment package had no significant effects on School Engagement. However, School Engagement accounted for a significant amount of variance in student math grades and teacher-reported antisocial behavior. These results suggest that school engagement may be an important target for improving grades and preventing antisocial behavior in the classroom. Issues of parental participation are discussed in the context of increasing treatment implementation.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use the post-test only maths test scores as the Toolkit and Mathematics primary outcome.

Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to compare scores on three factors, analyze, model, and solve systems of linear equations. We found comparable statistically significant learning gains in both treatment groups. We found that the focus on conceptual understanding was similar in the flipped and control classrooms, and the learning gains were statistically significant and similar in both groups. Explicit attention to the substance of the at-home videos and in-class activities is needed to use the flipped classroom model to successfully shift the instructional focus from procedural to conceptual understanding.","Comments":"Copyright - Copyright Taylor & Francis Ltd. 2015","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kirvan Rebecca ; Rakes Christopher R; Zamora Regie ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/07380569.2015.1093902","Keywords":"Education--Computer Applications\r\nMultivariate analysis\r\nLinear equations\r\nMathematical problems\r\nLearning","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kirvan Rebecca, Rakes Christopher R, and Zamora Regie (2015) Flipping an Algebra Classroom: Analyzing, Modeling, and Solving Systems of Linear Equations.

aim of the present study was to measure the effect of the flipped classroom on vocabulary learning in terms of both receptive and productive vocabulary. To do this, a post-test experimental research design was implemented. The participants of the study are 58 high school students. The experimental group was exposed to a four-week flipped instruction in which they worked on the pre-prepared videos designed by the teacher. The practice was done collaboratively inside the classroom. The control group was taught the target vocabulary in the traditional way in which the vocabulary presentation took place in the classroom and the practice was done as homework. Following the instruction of each group of words, a vocabulary quiz was administered to both groups. The results were analyzed by using the SPSS package program. The experimental group’s perceptions of the flipped classroom were also evaluated through an open-ended questionnaire. Depending on the results, it can be stated that the flipped classroom holds promise for the language learning process in terms of vocabulary learning. © 2019JLLS and the Authors - Published by JLLS.","Comments":"Cited By :1 | Export Date: 20 December 2019","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kırmızı Ö ; Kömeç F ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.17263/jlls.586096 ","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kırmızı Ö, and Kömeç F (2019) The impact of the flipped classroom on receptive and productive vocabulary learning.

Eighty-two students in two economics classes at a vocational high school participated in the study. This study adopted a pre-test and post-test quasi-experiment design with two teaching approaches taught by the same instructor. In the experimental group, the instructor assigned students into group and used team-based flipped learning; and in the control group, students learned from didactic teaching and unstructured small group discussion. The study employed achievement test, readiness assurance test, and Motivational Strategies Learning Questionnaire to assess students’ learning strategies and outcomes. Results of this study indicated a significant difference in students’ knowledge test and motivation scores between the two groups. Students in the team-based flipped learning class showed better performance and were more motivated. Meanwhile, the delayed post-test also indicated that the experimental group outperformed the control group. Based on the findings, this study proposed implications and suggestions for future research and teaching practice.

This study determined whether students who did English homework over an eleven-day period achieved higher scores on an English literature test than did students who did not do English homework over the same period of time. Moreover, the study assessed whether parental supervision of English homework influenced both students' grade point averages in English and students' scores on an English literature test. Finally, the study examined student and parental attitudes and practices with English homework. Method. Participants in this study included 94 senior (grade 12) English students and their parents. The data collected consisted of the scores on the English test and student and parental questionnaires. Students' t tests were applied to test three hypotheses. Results. Findings indicated that students who did English homework performed significantly better than did students who did not do English homework. This suggests that doing English homework will improve student performance on literature tests. However, there was no significant difference between the cumulative twelfth-grade grade point averages in English of students who did and students who did not receive parental supervision of their English homework, and no significant difference between scores on an English literature test of students who received parental supervision and students who did not.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"McGrath John Barry; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education\r\nparents\r\nSecondary education\r\nCurricula\r\nTeaching\r\nLanguage arts\r\n0279:Language arts\r\n0533:Secondary education\r\n0727:Teaching\r\n0727:Curricula","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McGrath John Barry (1992) Student and parental homework practices and the effect of English homework on student test scores. , United States International University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407153,"AdditionalText":"8","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":499361,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"The population included a total of eight classes[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Meloy_1987.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":499361,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"two large, rural elementary schools in a mid-Atlantic state[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Meloy_1987.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407105,"AdditionalText":"4","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":499361,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"Two classes from each school served as the control group while two other classes\nfrom each school served as the experimental group.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Meloy_1987.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":499361,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"Two classes from each school served as the control group while two other classes\nfrom each school served as the experimental group.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Meloy_1987.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407107,"AdditionalText":"4","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":499361,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"Two classes from each school served as the control group while two other classes\nfrom each school served as the experimental group.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Meloy_1987.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":499361,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"Two classes from each school served as the control group while two other classes\nfrom each school served as the experimental group.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Meloy_1987.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":499361,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 69:\n[¬s]\"Random selection of the four control groups and the four experimental groups\nwas not feasible.

determine the effect of homework on elementary students' achievement. Eight volunteer third and fourth grade classrooms were paired, based on percentile rankings on ITBS classroom composite scores, and then randomly assigned (within pairs) to one of two conditions--homework or no homework--for forty days of Language Arts instruction. The same third and fourth grade textbook series were used for instruction in all classrooms; however, total instructional time was significantly different between treatment groups. Participating schools represented varying socioeconomic neighborhoods in one rural community and one small city in eastern Iowa, but the treatment groups did not significantly differ on a measure of socioeconomic status. Classroom teachers varied on previous homework practices; and they differed significantly on percent of compliance with study demands. Student overall achievement levels ranged from the first to the ninety-ninth percentile. Pre- and post-testing was accomplished with two researcher-constructed instruments--a textbook Unit Test and a shortened version of the Iowa Tests Of Basic Skills Language Subtest. Achievement post-test scores of 70 third and 36 fourth graders on these two tests were the dependent measures for two three-way multivariate analyses of variance (2 x 5 x 2 for third grade and 2 x 3 x 2 for fourth grade). The fourth grade homework group showed significantly higher achievement on the textbook Unit Test only. A significant difference between treatment groups was seen for the third graders on the ITBS Test only, but in the direction of the no homework group. These results need to be viewed as two separate studies for third and for fourth grade; for the fourth grade, the results supported the effectiveness of homework, despite small sample size. Caution is recommended, however, in drawing conclusions from the study regarding the effectiveness of homework for third graders due to the confounding effects of significant teacher variability on compliance with study demands and significant instructional time differences between treatment groups.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Eighty-five students, 4 classes, were taught the same math material with two groups receiving instruction using the flipped model and two groups receiving instruction using the traditional classroom model. Pre- and post-assessment data were collected from each group to measure student achievement. Each class also had data collected from exit slips as well as homework scores. A survey was also administered to the flipped classes to measure students’ attitudes toward and perceptions of the learning experience. The results demonstrated that the treatment group had statistically significant higher levels of achievement on exit slip scores, homework scores and the change from the pre- to post-test scores. However when controlling for existing differences between groups, no significant differences were found. The results also demonstrate that there was no interaction between treatment and English Learner (EL) status on post-test scores, exit slip scores and homework scores, but that ELs performed at lower levels than non-ELs on the post-test and homework. Results on the student survey indicated the flipped model of instruction had an overall favorable impact on student perception during the flipped classroom learning experience.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Metcalf D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Metcalf D (2015) The impact of flipping a middle school classroom on student achievement.. , California State University, California."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":7549342,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":500309,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 37:\n[¬s]\"This quantitative study used a quasi-experimental cohort design with repeated measures\nto evaluate the effectiveness of using a flipped learning instruction with two seventh grade CCSS\nmath classes.

K-12 math teachers to search for new pedagogical strategies to instruct their students. This study investigated whether a popular learning environment called flipped learning is a valuable instructional technique to be used with a seventh grade CCSS’s math curriculum that emphasizes problem-based learning. Flipped learning is a form of blended learning that combines information and communication technology with instruction that switches the focus of the classroom instruction from one that is teacher-centered to one that is student-centered. Literature is limited with flipped learning being integrated in a K-12 math classroom. However, literature suggests that flipped learning and California CCSS Mathematics Framework share a commonality based on technology-supported learning, student-centered instruction and problem-based learning activities. This study used a quasi-experimental methodology with a repeated measures design to compare the effects flipped learning had on a group of middle school students’ academic achievement in a seventh grade CCSS math class. The two cohorts’ (control and intervention group) results from three measures (pre-test and two post-tests) were analyzed using three analyses: difference in average scaled scores, Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance, and t-tests to determine if there was a difference in performance. Though the findings show the effects of flipped learning were insignificant; the results from this study still suggest that flipped learning is equally an effective learning environment for student-centered instruction and/or blending other learning environments for K-12 teachers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Montgomery J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Montgomery J (2015) The effects of flipped learning on middle school students’ achievement with com mon core mathematics.. , California State University San Marcos, California."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":516650,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Because the participants were not randomly assigned and the\nresearcher worked with intact groups, the researcher employed a quasi-\nexperimental design (Gay et al., 2009).

Students in the treatment group completed online homework, while the control group received traditional paper-and-pencil homework. Data were collected from student attitudinal surveys, TCAP language arts scores, Discovery Education assessments, and multiple intelligence inventories in order to determine impact of the mode of homework received. The results of implementing online homework were mixed; however, treatment students did show significant attitude gains and felt that they benefited from the homework assignments.","Comments":"Trevecca Nazarene University.; School of Education. 28 cm Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education in Leadership and Professional Practice./ Copyright, 2012, Hope McGee Nordstrom/ Advisors: Judy Bivens; Rodney Russell./ Includes bibliographical references (leaves 91-103). by Hope McGee Nordstrom.

This study investigates the effect of homework assignments enriched with metacognitive questions on students' mathematics achievement and homework behaviors. A quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-test measures and two groups (experimental and control) was employed to investigate the effect of the enriched homework. Forty-four students, 25 boys and 19 girls, participated in the study. The students in the experimental group responded to metacognitive questions as they worked on homework that otherwise was common to both groups. First semester mathematics scores taken from students' report cards were used as a pre-test of mathematics achievement; the mean of second and third examination scores were used as a post-test. The results revealed a significant difference between the mathematics scores of students who had been given homework assignments enriched with metacognitive questions and those who had not been given such homework.","Comments":"Number of references - 52 SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - 4124ER5 4350ER5 4109 4335; 6432ER5 96ER5 6411 96; 3377ER5 10321ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 3363 10278 8016 4542; 4846ER5 677ER5 5259ER5 4831ER5 10324ER5 5902ER5 126ER5 4829 4814 10281 5883 126 675 5242; 6584ER5 1719ER5 6563 1710; 677ER5 5259ER5 675 5242; 8562ER5 8879ER5 2780ER5 8531 8847 2768; 8195ER5 10833ER5 6468ER5 8166 10789 6447; 6468ER5 6447; 2218ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 4558ER5 2207 4542 8852 6582; 3713ER5 8884ER5 6603ER5 4558ER5 3698 4542 8852 6582; 1966ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 1955 3629 6582; 4439ER5 5281ER5 4424 5264; 8635ER5 6468ER5 8603 6447; 10130ER5 10140ER5 6431ER5 5983ER5 10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 10092 10102 6410 5964 10087 2574 3629 6582; 10125ER5 2586ER5 3643ER5 6603ER5 10087 2574 3629 6582; 6085ER5 730ER5 6468ER5 8635ER5 6066 728 6447 8603; Turkey","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Özcan Zeynep Çigdem; Erktin Emine ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"http://dx.doi.org/10.12973/eurasia.2015.1402a","Keywords":"Turkey\r\nERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nElementary Education\r\nGrade 7\r\nJunior High Schools\r\nMiddle Schools\r\nSecondary Education\r\nQuasiexperimental Design\r\nElementary School Students\r\nMetacognition\r\nAssignments\r\nForeign Countries\r\nControl Groups\r\nPretests Posttests\r\nLikert Scales\r\nExperimental Groups\r\nComparative Analysis\r\nMeasures (Individuals)\r\nStatistical Distributions\r\nMathematics Achievement\r\nStatistical Analysis\r\nHomework\r\nRating Scales","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Özcan Zeynep Çigdem, and Erktin Emine (2015) Enhancing Mathematics Achievement of Elementary School Students through Homework Assignments Enriched with Metacognitive Questions.

The flipped classroom is defined by the Flipped Learning Network (2014) as an instructional method that moves direct instruction outside of the classroom in order to make room in the classroom for a more interactive learning environment where students can actively engage in the content. The flipped classroom strategy theoretically allows teachers the time to develop mathematical ideas and the ability to facilitate that development. For the Common Core State Standards initiative to be effective, teachers need to engage students in new learning experiences that support college and career readiness. By implementing a technology based instructional approach, like the flipped classroom strategy, teachers are able to blend twenty-first century skills with the development of the essential habits of mind of mathematically proficient students (Brunsell & Horejsi, 2013). This study seeks to understand how the flipped method of classroom instruction can lead to improved student achievement in mathematics courses and improve student perceptions about math in order to encourage course consumption in the future (Zollman, 2011). A modified explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used, and it involved collecting quantitative data and then explaining the quantitative results with in-depth qualitative data. In the quantitative phases of the study, NWEA Mathematics MAP Assessment data were collected from middle school students and course common final assessment scores were collected from middle school and high school students in a large Midwestern suburban school district to determine how student math achievement was impacted for students in a flipped classroom as compared to a traditionally instructed classroom. The frequency of active learning incidents was also collected during classroom observations. The qualitative phase was conducted as a follow up to the quantitative results to help explain the quantitative results. In this exploratory follow-up, student and teacher perceptions of mathematics achievement as a result of the flipped classroom approach to instruction with middle and high school math students and how those perceptions might be different than those of students and teachers in traditionally taught classrooms along with descriptions of observable active learning incidents in the school district were explored.","Comments":"Manhattan, Kan. : Kansas State University Mode of access: World Wide Web.

Nearest Neighbor matching was the matching algorithm of\nchoice and was chosen because it simplified the issue of available statistical software to execute\nthe matching. SPSS has a Propensity Score Matching plug-in available through a statistical\nprogram called R ((http://www.r-project.org/). For researchers interested in using Propensity\nScore Matching through the SPSS statistical platform, Thommes (2012) provides step-by-step\ninstructions for doing so. Using Nearest Neighbor matching presents researchers with other\nadditional challenges such as determining how many control subjects will be matched to each\nexperimental subject, whether matching will be executed with or without replacement of control\nsubjects, and whether or not caliper distances will be used to determine if control units are\neligible for matching. However, the ease of use of SPSS in combination with PSM, combined\nwith the fact that Nearest Neighbor Matching is the only available method of matching in SPSS,\nmake Nearest Neighbor Matching the most parsimonious choice for matching.\nWhile the literature claims there is very little difference between measured treatment\neffects between matching algorithms (Gu & Rosenbaum, 1993), using a reliable matching\ninstrument is an important aspect to the study. As a tool for reducing bias, PSM has been shown\nto have a high degree of validity, so long as the researcher doesn't violate the assumptions of\nboth nonignorable covariates and covariate balance (Rubin & Rosenbaum 1983, 1985), and as\nlong as there is acceptable balancing of control and experimental subject covariates after\nmatching.

In the past, technology has been used by educators to augment student learning. However, as we move deeper into the twenty-first century, the role of technology is beginning to change from that of supporting instruction to actively teaching students. Classroom flipping is an example of how technology can be used in this manner, and it has been posited that it could change the educational landscape forever. Classroom Flipping is the practice of taking direct instruction and moving it from the group learning environment to the individual learning environment (Mussalam, 2012). The concept of classroom flipping is a relatively new idea in the field of education, but is becoming increasing prevalent in the educational lexicon, as well as the research literature. Recent surveys in the field demonstrate an increase in the number of teachers, administrators and stake holders who are interested in the practice and believe it is a valid teaching method that will, for many content areas, become the preferred method of content delivery. Research in the field at the secondary and post-secondary level is becoming more readily available; however there has been very little published research at the elementary level. Research at this level is fraught with ethical, legal, and logistical difficulties. As traditional experimental methods aren’t always practical to educators and researchers, this study explored the use of a statistical method known as Propensity Score Matching (PSM). PSM enables researchers to use data from observational studies to create a “quasi-experimental” setting that mimics a randomized controlled trial in order to determine treatment effects (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). PSM also has been shown to reduce the biases known to plague observational studies when attempting to use them to determine treatment effects. PSM relies heavily on the ability of users to establish covariate balance through the use of propensity scores, and this dissertation will provide readers with the criteria by which researchers can ensure covariate balance. For this study, statistical and graphical tools were used to determine that a 1:5 treatment to control group ratio, without replacement of control subjects, and with a .1 caliper distance used to match control units was optimal for the purposes of matching subjects.Second, utilizing PSM, this study determined that there were no statistically significant differences between the learning outcomes of sixth graders who have received a flipped learning experience and those who haven’t on a standardized assessment. This study utilized the data from a teacher in the Washoe County School District (WCSD) known to have used the flipped learning method with her sixth grade math students and compared their learning outcomes on the Math Criterion Reference Test (CRT) to other sixth grade students who didn’t receive flipped instruction in their sixth mathematics classes. Third, this study used survey responses from WCSD teachers who have flipped their math and science classes to explore their perceptions of (a) what constitutes a flipped classroom, (b) how student performance has changed as a result of flipping their classes, and (c) how their roles as educators has changed as a consequence of flipping their classes. The survey results showed that teachers’ beliefs about what constitutes a flipped classroom is consistent with the literature. They also believe that student performance has improved as a result of flipping their classes. Lastly, they believe their roles as educators have changed into more collaborative roles, where they are able to spend more time and explore deeper concepts with their students.This study will add to the growing body of literature around classroom flipping and Propensity Score Matching in educational research. Ideally, educational researchers will use this study as a starting point to continue and expand upon the ideas introduced in this study, and conclusively determine a concrete set of best practices both for educators choosing to flip their classes and educational researchers wanting to use PSM in their work.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Ripley DG ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ripley DG (2015) An examination of flipped instructional method on sixth graders’ mathematics learn ing: Utilizing propensity score matching.. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"1\n\n\n","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":551960,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"These parents,\nunable to attend the training sessions, chose the option of assisting their children more\nactively with writing assignments and were assigned to the PAD group.

parental involvement in doing homework was sufficient to improve children’s outcomes or whether prior family training is required to enable them to be efficient. The sample consisted of 112 students (5th-6th grade) and their families. 26 of them made up the EFP group (mothers implementing a writing program), 25 of them were assigned to the PAD group (mothers increasing help with writing homework), 35 to the PRO group (teachers applying a writing program) and 26 to the OC group (ordinary curriculum). We analyze the results and present and discuss our conclusions.

In traditional settings, students are expected to listen to\nlectures, read individually, and take notes while instruction occurs. To follow up, teachers quiz\nor test students on the introduced concepts to ensure they have understood the material. Students\nspend class time listening to lectures, and if time allows, they may get to work examples of the\nnewly presented content (Bull & Kjell, 2013; Fulton, 2012b; Hull & Seeley, 2010). These\ntraditional approaches to instruction are being revamped and alternate methods are being\nconsidered to keep students engaged and motivated about their learning (Berrett, 2012; Fulton,\n2012a). The flipped classroom is one alternative to the traditional classroom setting. This\ninstructional setting incorporates digital technology within each lesson, provides students with\ntailored and differentiated instruction, and causes the educator to take a facilitator’s

The purpose of this study was twofold. The immediate purpose was to determine if there was a statistical difference in student academic achievement in two high school mathematics classrooms once the flipped classroom concept was implemented. This study also examined the effect of the flipped classroom on students’ critical thinking skills. This static-group comparison utilized a pretest-posttest non-equivalent control group design and two null hypotheses were tested. The flipped curriculum was not a significant factor in increasing student academic achievement or in increasing student critical thinking skills.

mixed-methods study investigated the effects of the flipped classroom on academic performance of high school advanced placement chemistry students. Student perceptions about the approach were also studied. The control group consisted of students from the 2011-2012 academic year, in which traditional teaching methods were used. The treatment group consisted of students from the 2012-2013 academic year, in which the flipped classroom approach was used. Identical assessments were administered and analyzed through both descriptive statistics and independent t tests. A statistically significant difference was found on all assessments with the flipped class students performing higher on average. In addition, most students had a favorable perception about the flipped classroom noting the ability to pause, rewind, and review lectures, as well as increased individualized learning and increased teacher availability. This contribution is part of a special issue on teaching introductory chemistry in the context of the advanced placement (AP) chemistry course redesign.","Comments":"Copyright - Copyright American Chemical Society Sep 9, 2014 CODEN - JCEDA8","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schultz David ; Duffield Stacy ; Rasmussen Seth C; Wageman Justin ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1021/ed400868x ","Keywords":"Chemistry\r\nEffects\r\nAcademic achievement\r\nAdvanced Placement program\r\nSecondary school students\r\nTeaching methods\r\nPlacement\r\nOrganic chemistry\r\nAssessments\r\nClassrooms\r\nStatistical tests\r\nRedesign\r\nStudent attitudes\r\nTeachers\r\nLearning\r\nStudents","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schultz David, Duffield Stacy, Rasmussen Seth C, and Wageman Justin (2014) Effects of the Flipped Classroom Model on Student Performance for Advanced Placement High School Chemistry Students.

One section of Integrated II Mathematics received instruction through traditional means while another section received instruction through a flipped-classroom delivery method. Both sections received the same pretest, posttest, and set of six quizzes which were compared using independent-samples t tests. Additionally, the flipped-classroom instruction completed a survey at the end of the unit on basic trigonometry concepts. Three of the six quizzes had significantly higher scores for the students who received instruction through the flipped-classroom. Survey responses yielded no significant differences, but all scores were higher for the students who received instruction by the flipped-classroom instructional method. The study suggests some material may be better delivered by the flipped classroom method of delivery and students have an overall more positive attitude toward their learning in a flipped classroom.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The teacher in the flipped classrooms created learning videos for students to view at home. Students reviewed the videos at home to prepare them for the next day. Students returned to school to complete homework and projects. In the traditional classroom, students received their instruction via lectures. Students then practiced with the learning content by completing homework outside of the classroom. The researcher utilized a mixed-methods research design. Quantitatively, the study investigated student achievement and homework completion rates between the students in the flipped classrooms and those students in the traditional classrooms. The findings indicated student achievement did not improve with a flipped learning model. Also, traditional students had a higher homework completion rate versus the students in the flipped classrooms. In addition, the researcher collected qualitative data from the teacher, students, and parents regarding the efficacy of the flipped classroom. Students, parents, and the teacher reported the flipped classrooms actively engaged students more in a flipped classroom versus a traditional classroom. Students acknowledged the flipped classroom provided more time with the teacher to ask for help, provided challenging work, and allowed students the ability to work at their own pace. The negative impact of a flipped classroom included an array of technological issues that occurred at home. Also, it was noted that students who are not self-motivated and responsible for their own learning are more likely to struggle in a flipped classroom.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Smith JP ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Smith

progress opens up new paths in the pedagogical research. More and more emphasis is\nplaced on the use of online learning materials in the educational process. This growing pressure\nopens up the discussion to change education reality in school classrooms. One of the ways to change\nthe educational realities in the educational facilities is the flipped classroom. Especially in math\nteaching which uses modelling reality using mathematical models, has a chance to use online\nvisualization in education process. Learning mathematics requires a certain degree of concentration,\nwhich is quite difficult for today's generation of students of elementary school. The article brings the\nresults of pedagogical experiment, when visualization of mathematical models was tested on the\nupper-primary schools. For the purposes of the experiment has created an animated educational\nvisualizations. In post-test results was recorded statistically significant difference between the control\nand experimental group.

parental involvement in monitoring mathematics homework of seventh grade Hispanic students improved their achievement, to assess the effects of parental homework monitoring on the students' self-esteem and to determine if the students' perceptions of their teachers, their parents and their own involvement in mathematics homework changed after the monitoring experience. A total of 28 families/31 students participated in the study. A pretest-posttest control group design was used. The experimental group subjects' parents received training in homework monitoring. The Computation section, Level 2 of the Mathematics subtest of the Stanford Achievement Test, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventories and, a \"Student Mathematics Homework Perception Scale\" constructed by the researcher were used for pre and posttest measures of achievement, self-esteem and students' perceptions. The students' grades and the percentage of homework they completed and returned for the first three quarters were obtained from their mathematics teachers. Ten of the experimental group subjects' families were interviewed at the end of the study. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between either the computation or the self-esteem posttest scores of the two groups. No significant differences were obtained for teachers' grades and the percentage of homework completed and returned. However, the grades and percentage of homework completed and returned by the experimental group showed a trend in the expected direction. A significant difference was found (p $<$.05) in the perception posttest scores of teacher involvement in mathematics homework. Significant negative correlations were found between parent level of education (p $<$.05) and self-esteem measures and between teachers' grades and self-esteem measures (p $<$.05) for the experimental group. The home interviews revealed: Positive feelings and sense of closer relationship between parents and students, a heightened sense of responsibility for mathematics homework by parents and students in their respective roles, and conflictual issues between parents and students in following the homework monitoring program. Educational implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Tamayo Luis F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"\nHomework.\nEducation, Elementary -- Parent participation.\nJunior high school students -- Attitudes.\nHispanic American students -- Attitudes.\nAcademic achievement.\nMathematics -- Study and teaching (Elementary) -- Psychological aspects.\nAchievement motivation in children.\nAcademic achievement.\nAchievement motivation in children.\nEducation, Elementary -- Parent participation.\nHispanic American students -- Attitudes.\nHomework.\nJunior high school students -- Attitudes.\nMathematics -- Study and teaching (Elementary) -- Psychological aspects.\nGenre/Form: Academic theses.\nAcademic theses.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tamayo Luis F (1992) Hispanic parent monitoring of seventh grade mathematics homework assignments and relationship with achievement and self-esteem. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":7549342,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5023556,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407105,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":550631,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"The first was the\ngroup learning through flipped classroom and\nPBL (FPBL group, n=50)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Tsai etal_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407107,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":550631,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"the second was\nthe group learning through PBL (PBL group,\nn=48)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Tsai etal_2015.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":550631,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"In this study, the computer course was 20 weeks\nlong.

quasi-experiments, the effects of problem-based learning with flipped classroom (FPBL) on the development of students' learning performance. In this study, 144 elementary school students were selected from six grade sections taking a course titled 'Production of Ebook', and were assigned into the following three groups: FPBL group (n = 50), PBL group (n = 48), Control group (n = 46). The authors collected both quantitative and qualitative data, including interviews with students and teacher's journal. Based on the analysis in this study, it is found that the effect of FPBL on improving students' learning performance was significantly higher than other teaching methods investigated. This research provides an innovative design and illustration of PBL for teachers, educators, and schools which pay attention to enhancing students' learning performance.

Generally this has been done at all levels beyond\nthe elementary grades and in all content areas, without considering the individual differences and varied objec­tives of the learners involved (Epps, 1966).\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate whether the educational goals of Geometry B (slow-track) students could be attained without giving out-of-class written home­ work. It was hypothesized that there would be no signifi­cant differences in achievement between the assignment and the no-assignment treatments, and that other affective variables would favor the no-assignment group. The most important among these are favorable attitude toward mathe­matics and active participation while doing mathematics, which in themselves constitute desirable educational goals for this type of a mathematics student.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

This study examined the effects of a weekly interactive mathematics program (Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork-TIPS) on family involvement, emotions and attitudes, and student achievement. Students and families (N=153) from four urban elementary schools participated in this two-year quasi-experimental study, with teachers assigned randomly to TIPS or Control conditions. Seventeen percent of students used TIPS two years, forty percent completed TIPS one year, and forty-three percent never used TIPS. The majority of the sample (57%) represented African-American students, and the remaining students (43%) were Caucasian, with almost 70% of the sample qualifying for free- or reduced-price lunch. Overall, TIPS students and families reported significantly higher levels of family involvement, more positive feelings and attitudes about math homework, and significantly higher standardized mathematics scores than Control students. This coordinated homework process may be a useful tool for educators seeking more favorable and academically productive home learning experiences for students and their families.

The study also explored the lived experiences of the teachers and students in the three different learning environments and the effect students' learning style had on preference for learning environment.\n\nKey findings of the study were: 1) students in the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments scored significantly higher on mathematics achievement than students in the Traditional learning environment; 2) students in the Flipped Mastery learning environment scored significantly higher on mathematics self-efficacy than students in the Traditional learning environment; 3) students in both the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments appreciated the level of control over the learning process but were dissatisfied by the inability to ask real-time questions; 4) students in the Flipped Mastery learning environment enjoyed working at an individualistic pace but struggled with falling behind; and 5) students preferring active, sensing, sequential, and verbal learning experiences expressed satisfaction with both the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments.\n\nThe study findings suggest that classroom teachers should utilize the Flipped Instructional approach to make more in-class time for active learning strategies; and implement mastery learning strategies to promote student responsibility, self-regulation, and ownership of the learning process. Future research should investigate the effect that Flipped Instruction has on the learning environment at the middle and high school level as well as in subject areas other than mathematics.\n\n","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms.

My first interview question concerned the video\nlessons and whether students felt they learned as well from watching the videos as listening to\nthe teacher in class. The majority of students liked learning to work algebra problems using the\nteacher-created videos. They liked that the videos afforded them the freedom to learn at a pace\nthat matched their ability and they liked being able to watch the videos at home, school, or as one\ngirl put it, “On my iPhone wherever I am.” Several students stated they liked having the ability\nto rewind and review certain lessons to increase understanding or prepare for assessments. Seven\nof the ten students interviewed individually stated that they felt the videos were effective in\nhelping them learn their lessons.\nTina said,\nI like the videos because I understand that they actually work things out in front of us and\nfor the traditional classroom they go ahead even if you are not ready to go ahead but now\nwe get to go at our own pace so it is better.

If I have\nsomeone work the problems out on the board, I have an easier time understanding it\nrather than watching a video because you can ask questions a little bit easier when you\nare all together in a classroom and everyone has a chance to have input on it rather than\nyou being the only one watching it.\nRobert described why he thought the videos were not as effective for some students as they could\nhave been.\nI know the teacher is still talking but sometimes I think I wish she was still at the board\nbecause I know the video tells you everything but if you don’t understand the video you\ncan’t ask the video questions.

I\nguess over time I learned it better.\nLoren agreed, “Sometimes I watch it more than once. I take my notes and sometimes when you\nare taking notes you don’t really take everything in. So then I go back and watch it again.”\nI observed students watching the videos during the face-to-face portion of class. When I\nasked the students of Class B where they watched the videos, all of them stated that they watched\nthem at home, during class, or anywhere they have Internet access. Oscar said,\nIt [LMS] still has the videos and it gives lessons and if you have any questions after the\nvideo or during all you have to do is ask and she would answer them. I usually do the\nvideo in class because if I have a question I can ask it right then and there instead of\nhaving to wait and maybe forgetting the question.\nStudents had the opportunity to watch the videos at home or during class and the majority of\nstudents indicated that they preferred to watch them during class.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Wiginton_2013.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":646129,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 130:\n[¬s]\"to show we watched it.

The study also explored the lived experiences of the teachers and students in the three different learning environments and the effect students' learning style had on preference for learning environment. Key findings of the study were: 1) students in the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments scored significantly higher on mathematics achievement than students in the Traditional learning environment; 2) students in the Flipped Mastery learning environment scored significantly higher on mathematics self-efficacy than students in the Traditional learning environment; 3) students in both the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments appreciated the level of control over the learning process but were dissatisfied by the inability to ask real-time questions; 4) students in the Flipped Mastery learning environment enjoyed working at an individualistic pace but struggled with falling behind; and 5) students preferring active, sensing, sequential, and verbal learning experiences expressed satisfaction with both the Flipped Active and Flipped Mastery learning environments. The study findings suggest that classroom teachers should utilize the Flipped Instructional approach to make more in-class time for active learning strategies; and implement mastery learning strategies to promote student responsibility, self-regulation, and ownership of the learning process. Future research should investigate the effect that Flipped Instruction has on the learning environment at the middle and high school level as well as in subject areas other than mathematics.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms.

purpose of this study was to investigate whether the flipped (revised) learning had effect on student learning outcome. Lage et al (2000) describes the flipped classroom as  \" Inverting the classroom means that events that have traditionally take place inside the classroom now take place outside the class and vice versa\" (p.32). The participants in this study were 250 students and five teachers from a secondary school in Ardabil. Homogenous students were selected on the basis of their scores in the last year.  Ten classes were considered for investigation. There were 25 students in each class and each teacher taught two classes that one of classes was flipped class and another was ordinary class. T-test was used to compare the overall performances of two classes in each subject in order to determine the effect of flipped learning on students’ learning outcomes. The findings of this research demonstrated that there were significant differences between flipped and ordinary classes in students’ learning outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Yousefzadeh M ; Salimi A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.7575/aiac.alls.v.6n.5p.209 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yousefzadeh M, and Salimi A (2015) The effect of flipped learning (revised learning) on Iranian students’ learning outcomes..
