Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\r\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools). Peers will normally be of similar age and socio-economic or cultural background.\r\rUniversity students tutoring primary school pupils would not usually be classified as 'peers'.","AttributeType":"Not

effects of a parent education program on the development of children aged between 60 and 72 months attending preschool were assessed. Participants were children attending 9 kindergartens located in central Ankara and their parents (experimental group: 68 children, 68 parents, control group: 68 children, 68 parents). Data were gathered using a general information form, and the version of the Brigance Early Development Inventory II (Brigance, 2004), that was adapted for use in Turkey by Aral et al. (2008). There was a significant difference between the scores on the subtests of the Brigance Early Development Inventory II and the total pretest and corrected posttest scores independent of group, but no significant difference was found between the scores of the groups on the Brigance Early Development Inventory II or the total pretest and corrected posttest scores. The results also revealed that the parent education program had a minimal effect on children’s daily life and social emotional skills.","Comments":"Please treat academic/cognitive skills as the primary and receptive/expressive language skills as the secondary outcome.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aral Neriman ; Baran Gülen ; Gürsoy Figen ; Akyol Aysel Köksal; Ayhan Aynur Bütün; Biçakçi Müdriye Yildiz; Erdoğan Serap ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2011.39.2.241","Keywords":"CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT\r\nPRESCHOOL EDUCATION\r\nPARENT EDUCATION PROGRAMS\r\nTURKEY","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aral Neriman, Baran Gülen, Gürsoy Figen, Akyol Aysel Köksal, Ayhan Aynur Bütün, Biçakçi Müdriye Yildiz, and Erdoğan Serap (2011) The effects of parent education programs on the development of children aged between 60 and 72 months.

One hundred and eighty-two low-income families (84 in HIPPY and 98 in the control group) were assessed at baseline, at the end of the program, and one year later. Outcomes included assessments of children's cognitive skills, adaptation to the classroom, and standardized achievement at the end of the two-year program, and classroom adaptation and standardized achievement one year later. Data were collected from objective measures, teacher ratings, and school records. Analyses of covariance were conducted controlling for baseline scores on child and family background variables. Results revealed that for Cohort I there were significant and educationally meaningful differences in children's school performance both at the end of the program and one year later. These results were not replicated in Cohort II. Attrition analyses did not reveal differences between groups and cohorts which would account for the lack of replication. Findings are interpreted as mixed support for the effectiveness of the HIPPY program to improve the chances that poor children will succeed in school.","Comments":"MDE: Please code for cohort 1","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baker A J.

a two-year, free, home-based, family-oriented, early childhood education intervention - was assessed in a longitudinal, two cohort, randomized experimental evaluation. One hundred and eighty-two low-income families (84 in HIPPY and 98 in the control group) were assessed at baseline, at the end of the program, and one year later. Outcomes included assessments of children's cognitive skills, adaptation to the classroom, and standardized achievement at the end of the two-year program, and classroom adaptation and standardized achievement one year later. Data were collected from objective measures, teacher ratings, and school records. Analyses of covariance were conducted controlling for baseline scores on child and family background variables. Results revealed that for Cohort I there were significant and educationally meaningful differences in children's school performance both at the end of the program and one year later. These results were not replicated in Cohort II. Attrition analyses did not reveal differences between groups and cohorts which would account for the lack of replication. Findings are interpreted as mixed support for the effectiveness of the HIPPY program to improve the chances that poor children will succeed in school.","Comments":"MDE: Please code for cohort 2","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baker A J.

The printed version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Parent (DISC-P) version 2.1 that was constructed and used in the DSM-IV ?eld trials for the Disruptive Behavior Disorders (Lahey et al., 1994) was employed in this study. This particular interview was designed to collect information on both DSM-III-R and DSM- IV symptom lists for 12 childhood disorders. Since the ?nal DSM-IV symptom lists for each disorder are now published, the present project employed those criteria in the scoring of the results of this interview rather than using the older DSM-III-R criteria. The interview also required that both the parent and interviewer provide separate estimates of the child’s global assessment of functioning scale using a range of 0 to 100 with lower scores re?ecting poorer global functioning.\"\n\"Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edel- brock, 1983). This scale provides T-scores for seven diﬀerent dimensions of child psychopathology and has been used extensively in child mental health research. The revised 1991 scoring sytem was employed in this study. The Sex Problems, Somatic Complaints, and Thought Problems scales were not used given that these domains offunctioning were not a focus of this intervention program and that there is no equivalent Sex Problems scale on the teacher version of the CBCL also used in this project (see below). The scales used were those for Withdrawal, AnxietyDepression, Social Problems, Attention Problems, Aggression, and Delinquent Behavior.\"\n\"Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ; Barkley, 1990). This scale assesses the pervasiveness of behavior problems across 16 diﬀerent home and public setttings (Number of Problem Settings) and the severity of these behavior problems (Mean Severity Score) as rated on a Likert scale of 1 to 9. These two raw scores were used in this study.\"\n\"Normative Adaptive Behavior Checklist (Adams, 1984). This 120-item questionnaire surveys parents about a child’s adaptive functioning in eight areas of development, including ﬁne motor, gross motor, language, and self-help skills, in- dependence, home responsibilities, etc. The total adaptive behavior score (standard score) was used here.\"\n\"Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI; Abidin, 1986). This is a shortened version of the original PSI and is completed by parents. It evaluates the degree of perceived stress in the role of being a parent to this particular child. Only the Total Stress raw score was used here.\"\n\"Parenting Sense ofCompetence Scale (Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman, 1978; Mash & Johnston, 1983). This self-report scale was employed to evaluate a parent’s degree of self- perceived competence or eﬃcacy (nine items) and satisfaction (seven items) in their role as a parent. It produces separate raw scores for each of these two domains.\"\n\"CBCL-Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1986): This scale contains 126 items related to children’s behavioral and emotional problems. It yields eight T- scores identical to those for the parent version noted above with the exception that no Sex Problems scale is generated. Again, the 1991 scoring system was employed for this study. The scales used were for Withdrawal, AnxietyDepression, Social Prob- lems, Attention Problems, Aggression, and Delinquent Be- havior. The Somatic Complaints and Thought Problems scales were not employed here given that these domains offunctioning were not speciﬁcally targeted within the intervention programs.\"\n\"School Situations Questionnaire (SSQ; Barkley, 1990). This rating scale provided a measure of the pervasiveness of a child’s behavior problems across 12 diﬀerent school situations (Number ofProblems Settings). Each problem setting was rated as to severity using a Likert scale (1–9) so as to provide a Mean Severity Score across all problem settings. Raw scores were used here.\"\n\"Self-Control Rating Scale (Kendall & Wilcox, 1979). This is a 33-item scale used to assess children’s self-control. A single summary raw score was generated for this behavioral di- mension.\"\n\"Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS; Gresham & Elliott, 1990). This standardized and normed teacher-completed scale was used to assess the social skills (30 items), behavioral problems (18 items), and academic competence (9 items) of the children. Three standard scores were obtained from this scale, one for each domain.\"\n\"Woodcock Johnson Psychoeducational Test Battery (Woodcock&Johnson, 1984). This lengthy test battery includes a number of tests assessing cognitive abilities (intelligence) as well as a separate battery of tests assessing academic knowledge (science, social studies, humanities) and skills (reading, math, spelling). Standard scores are produced for each subtest. Only the academic knowledge and skills tests were used in assessing treatment eﬀects.\"\n\"Continuous Performance Test (CPT; Gordon, 1983). The preschool version was used here, which provided raw scores for total correct and number of commission errors. The task uses a single digit target (‘‘1’’) that appears in a random series ofdigits presented at the rate of one per second on the display screen of a small computerized device. The task lasts 6 minutes. Due to the young age of the subjects and consistent with recom- mendations of the test developer, the examiner remained in the room during the testing.\"\n\"Disruptive behavior during the CPT. During the child’s performance of the CPT, the child’s behavior was videotaped from behind a one-way mirror. These videotapes were later coded for four categories of behavior related to ADHD using the Restricted Academic Situations Coding System developed by Barkley (1990). These categories were: oﬀ-task, ﬁdgets, vocalizes, and out-of-seat. Deﬁnitions of the codes and inform- ation on the reliability and validity of the system can be found\"\n\"Parenting Practices Scale (Strayhorn & Weidman, 1988).\"\n\"This is a 34-item scale used to assess the extent to which parents\nuse various practices commonly taught in most behavioral\nparent training programs.

The examiner records the occurrence\nof each behavior category within each 15-second interval. The\nmeasures derived from this coding system were obtained by\ncalculating the percentage occurrence of each category of\nbehavior relative to its total possible occurrences. A second\ncoder independently recoded 20% of the videotapes so as to\nprovide an estimate of inter-coder reliability for this measure.\nAgreement between these two coders for these observations was\ncomputed using Pearson product-moment correlations for the\nscores of percentage occurrence for each behavioral category.\nThe inter-coder agreements across the three cohorts for each\ncategory were: o?-taskl.97, ?dgetsl.93, vocalizesl.95,\nand out-of-seatl.97.\"\n\"Classroom behavioral observations. To record the behavior of\nchildren in their classrooms, this study employed the CBCL-\nDirect Observation Form (DOF; Achenbach, 1986). This\ncoding system is designed to assess the same behavioral items\nthat are found on the parent and teacher versions of the CBCL\ndescribed earlier. The observer visited the child’s classroom and\nobserved the child for 1 hour, after which the rating scale was\ncompleted by the observer. The total raw scores for the\nexternalizing and internalizing items were scored separately and\nreported here. For 20% of the subjects, a second observer\naccompanied the ﬁrst to the same classroom and observed the\nchild for the same 1-hour interval, after which they completed\nthis observation form. The two coders in this case sat at\ndiﬀerent locations in the classroom so as to avoid observing the\nother’s completion of this observation form. Inter-coder re-\nliability was calculated using a Pearson product-moment corre-\nlation separately for the externalizing, internalizing, and total\nraw scores with the following results : internalizing symptoms,\n.69, externalizing symptoms, .80, and total symptoms, .75.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Barkley etal_2000.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414575,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Mental health history.

This task was designed to be comparable to the\nRestricted Academic Situations task used with school-age\nADHD children (Barkley, 1990). Typically, this procedure\ninvolves placing the child in a clinic playroom with adjacent\nobservation room and shared one-way mirror and having the\nchild sit alone and perform math problems. Because of the\nyoung age ofthe subjects used here, this procedure was modiﬁed\nsuch that the child was required to sort plastic colored chips into\ncontainers by their color (red, blue, white) instead ofperforming\nmath problems. The task lasted 15 minutes. The child was\nvideotaped from behind the one-way mirror during this task.\nThe same four behavior categories used during the CPT were\nscored for their percentage occurrence in order to measure\nADHD symptoms during task performance. Additionally, the\nnumber of chips sorted by the child was also scored. A second\ncoder independently recoded 20% of the videotapes so as to\nprovide an estimate of inter-coder reliability for this measure.\nAgreement was computed using Pearson product-moment cor-\nrelations for the percentage occurrence scores for each behav-\nioral category and the results were: oﬀ-taskl.94, ﬁdgetsl\n.95, vocalizesl.98, and out-of-seatl.98.\"\n\"Mother–childinteractions during free play andtask periods.\nMothers and children were asked to play with each other using\ntoys in a playroom for a 10-minute period.

These 'disruptive' children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year: no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains: parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother-child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children. Even so, most treatment effects were specific to the school environment and did not affect achievement skills. These findings must be viewed as tentative until follow-up evaluations can be done to determine the long-term outcomes of these interventions.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 4 arms.

The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Beach D W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beach D W (2004) The effects of a school district's kindergarten readiness summer program on phonological awareness skills of at-risk prekindergarten students: A regression discontinuity analysis. , Utah State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":864342,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"The second phase of the study aimed to examine if an early enrichment program\nproviding the child with school readiness skills enabled the child to start ahead and enjoy\ninitial success in primary school.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bekman_2004.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":864342,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"The Mother–Child Education Program focuses on both the child and the child’s immediate\nenvironment rather than reaching only the child.

after the termination of the program and at the end of the children's first year of formal schooling. A prebost control group quasiexperimental design was used. There were 102 experimental and 115 control mother-child pairs, the total sample being 217. The results revealed that the Program has important effects on the cognitive development of the child as reflected in the significant increase in the performance of the group receiving training with respect to preliteracy and prenumeracy skills. When the children were followed in their first year of schooling, the experimental children were found to be better at in literacy and numeracy skills and had started to read earlier than the control group. Furthermore, their end-of-year grades were better than their counterparts. Teachers also perceived them as meeting the cognitive and social requirements of the school and being more curious, attentive, and creative.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bekman Sevda ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s19309325nhsa0701_4","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bekman Sevda (2004) Early home intervention to promote school readiness: A Turkish experience.

All boys in a central New York State school's kindergarten sections were assigned to a father -read- to , a mother-read- to , a father -not-participating, or a control (unplanned reading ) group for a six-month treatment period. The experimental groups were read to by the assigned parent reader about two or three times a week. The dependent variables were letter naming and word recognition (isolated words and words in context). The predictor criterion measures were administered individually at the conclusion of treatment, which coincided with the beginning of the boys ' first-grade school year. Within the context of the study's limitations, the results indicated that father -read- to boys had significantly higher mean scores on the words in context or criterion measure than the mother-read- to , the father -not-participating, or the control group of boys .","Comments":"MDE: Please code for mothers and fathers as treatment vs control.\nESDE: Combine Ns Means and SDs for mothers and fathers participating versus control.

A parental assistance plan (PAP) was devised to involve parents in working on language with their children at home 20 minutes a day & brought the parents into school a few hours per week for 12 weeks. The mothers of 2 groups followed the PAP (1 group also received the Distar language program), 1 group received only the Distar, & 1 group received no formal intervention but merely played with toys in the presence of a teacher for an equivalent period. Results of an immediate EPVT posttest & another one 18 months later showed that the groups with the PAP showed significantly greater increase in language development.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beveridge M ; Jerrams Ann ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8279.1981.tb02484.x","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beveridge M, and Jerrams Ann (1981) Parental involvement in language development: An evaluation of a school-based parental assistance plan.

Twenty-seven Head Start children, ages 3 to 5, and their parents/caregivers participated in the study. An experimental-control group design to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention and the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening for Preschoolers (PALS-PreK) was used as a pre and post-test assessment. Results indicated there were no significant interactions of the intervention and children's scores for the intact groups. There were also no significant changes in parent behaviors and attitudes toward reading, as measured by a family reading survey, as a result of the intervention. During post hoc analyses, an age effect was investigated and results indicated 4-year-old children in the intervention group scored significantly higher than 4-year-old children in the control group. In addition, 4- and 5-year-old children in the intervention group also made significant gains on the print awareness subtest of the PALS-PreK. Anecdotal changes in parent and children behavior as a result of the intervention are also reported. Recommendations include expanding parent-child literacy activities from shared story-book reading and addressing attrition problems in studies with families from impoverished backgrounds.","Comments":"Coders: Please use combined scores for 3, 4 and 5 year-old, experimental vs. control.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Boyle Elizabeth A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Boyle Elizabeth A (2006) The effects of a parent-child early literacy intervention on children's phonemic awareness and preliteracy skills. , The Johns Hopkins University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215228,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":488584,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"the effects of teaching the\nparticipating Even Start mothers a shared book reading strategy[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Brickman_2002.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":488584,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 68:\n[¬s]\"The design for this study was a two-group pretest posttest comparison, a\nquasi- experimental design.

Even Start mothers to use dialogic reading strategies with their preschool children were examined in this experimental study. Thirty-four children and their mothers participated. Mothers in the treatment group were taught to use the strategy to engage their children in conversation while reading storybooks. Data gathered from the children at pretest and posttest were measures of receptive vocabulary (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised), expressive vocabulary by calculating mean length of utterance and concepts about print using a checklist. Use of the Adult/Child Interactive Reading Inventory (ACIRI) provided data about mother and child behaviors at pretest and posttest. An attitudinal measure assessed the trained mothers' self-efficacy as a literacy coach. Findings include direct effects on the mothers' ability to use the strategy as well as indirect effects on the children's emergent literacy behaviors. Statistically significant effects were found for concepts about print (p < .05) using an ANOVA. A strong positive correlation (r(12) = .85, p < .001) between the treatment group mother's and child's ACIRI score was found. Time spent in Even Start (p < .02) and the mother's ACIRI score (p < .01) were positively related to the child's mean length of utterance in a multiple linear regression analysis. A moderate positive correlation was found (r(12) = .54, p < .05) for the relation between the mother's ACIRI score and the self-efficacy measure at posttest. Implications include a promising reading strategy resulting in the growth of emergent literacy skills for bilingual children and changed reading behaviors for their mothers in workshop format that could be easily and inexpensively incorporated into existing curriculum in intergenerational literacy programs.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code PPVT-R as primary, Concepts of print and Expressive language as secondary outcomes.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Brickman Sharon Olivia; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education\nReading.\nHispanic American Children Education (Preschool)\nReading (Preschool)\nReading Parent Participation.\nEven Start Program (U.S.)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brickman Sharon Olivia (2002) Effects of a joint book reading strategy on Even Start. , The University of Oklahoma."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":8623883,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"Parental Engagement","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":682265,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Tutor­\ning sessions were structured and used rich\nreading materials.

It was also suggested to parents and children to read in close physical prox­ imity to make the experience more intimate and enjoyable. 5) Quality of the material. Good quality materials were used with all sub­ jects to ensure a certain uniformity and enjoyment of reading. Since the reading materials available to each child at home were different, we gave a standard mater­ ial package to all participants. This package included 50 Hash cards (26 letters, 16 con­ sonant-vowel syllables and 8 consonant-vow el-consonant syllables) and 32 small first grade books from a popular series of child literature in Quebec. The flash cards were used for letter reading and syllable recognition activities, while the small books were introduced to practice reading with prose-like materials. The sto­ ries included in the books were adapted to the reading level of the pupils and followed the progression of materials received in school. The children received two or three books at each tutoring session. These books contained illustrations and were interest­ ing from the children’s perspective.

During these visits, the parent\nand the child practiced reading while the\nassistant observed them. Afterwards, the\nassistant made comments by focusing first\non positive aspects, then by discussing\nother aspects that needed improvement.\nWith a checklist inspired by Bushnell et\nal.

Phonological\nawareness was assessed with the French\nAuditory Analysis Test (Test d'analyse\nauditive en fran^ais. TAAF) proposed by\nRosner and Simon (1971). The lest was\ntranslated and adapted by Gignac (1997)\nwith the collaboration of Cormier from the\nUniversity of Moncton. This is a test\nadministered exclusively orally where the\npupil is invited to play with sounds. Gen­\nerally, the test consisted in making a child\nrepeat a word, then asking him/her to say\nit again by removing a particular sound\n(omission of a syllable or phoneme). For\nexample, the examiner asked the child to\nrepeat the word * Hying', then asked him to\nrepeal it again but without the fing' sound\nat the end of the word. The child then had\nto say the word *fly' in order to pass that\nitem. The lest was divided in eight cate­\ngories in which the pupil had to repeal a\nword by eliminating a syllabic or phoneme\neither at the beginning, in the middle oral\nthe end of the word. In the first, second\nand seventh categories, the child had to\nremove a syllable at the end, al the begin-\nning and in the middle of a word,\nrespectively. In the third category, the pupil\nhad to remove a phoneme at the end of a\nword, whereas in the fourth and fifth cat­\negories, he/she had to remove a phoneme\nat the beginning of a w ord. Finally, for the\nsixth and eighth categories, the child bad\nto remove a phoneme placed in the mid­\ndle of a word. The lest ended when two\nconsecutive categories were entirely failed.\nEach category included eight items and\nscores ranged from 0 to 8. The total score\nwas the average of the eight caiegories.\nAn analysis of internal consistency for\neach category indicated Cronbach’s alpha\ncoefficients from 0.77 to 0.83. These results\nwere fairly similar to those reported by\nCormier, MacDonald. Grandmaison and\nOuellctte-Lebel (1995) who validated a\nsimilar version of the TAAF. In their study,\nCronbach’s alpha coefficients varied from\n0.68 to 0.91. As for validity, Cormier el al.\n(1995) found statistically significant links\nbetween scores on the TAAF and perfor­\nmance on reading and spelling sub-tests,\nwhich is consistent with the results of other\nstudies on the relations between phono­\nlogical awareness and academic\nperformance (Blachman, 2000).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Cadieux &

that involving parents in their children's education is an effective strategy for children at risk of reading failure. In a pre-test/post-test control group design, parents in an experimental group received reading materials and were trained on techniques to stimulate their child during paired reading at home, while a control group only received materials. Reading and general academic abilities were pre- and post-tested, as well as phonological awareness and self-concept. The results show statistically significant gains in general academic abilities and phonological awareness in favor of the experimental group, while no significant gains were noted in reading abilities and self-concept. This report discusses the factors which could explain those results.","Comments":"Please code reading as the primary outcome\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cadieux Alain ; Boudreault Paul ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Parent participation (Education)\r\nReading skills","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cadieux Alain, and Boudreault Paul (2005) The effects of a parent-child paired reading program on reading abilities, phonological awareness and self-concept of at-risk pupils.

This study evaluated the effects of a novel intervention, Fathers Supporting Success in Preschoolers: A Community Parent Education Program, which focuses on integrating behavioral parent training with shared book reading (i.e., Dialogic Reading) using key conceptual models (i.e., common elements, deployment model, task shifting) to engage and improve father (i.e., male guardians) and child outcomes. One hundred twenty-six low-income, Spanish-speaking fathers and their children were recruited across three Head Startcenters in urban communities and were randomized to the intervention or to a waitlist control condition. Outcomes were obtained before and immediately postintervention and included observed and father-reported parenting and child behaviors, standardized assessments of language, and father self-reported parental stress and depressive symptoms. Attendance data were also collected as a proxy measure of engagement to the intervention. Parenting behaviors (observed and father-reported), child behaviors (father-reported), and language development of the children in the intervention group improved significantly relative to those in the waitlist control condition. Effect sizes (ESs) were in the small to large range across outcomes. Fathers can be engaged in parenting interventions, resulting in improved parent and child outcomes. Greater attention must be given to methods for maximizing parenting within a family and toward developing effective, engaging, and sustainable intervention models for fathers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chacko A ; Fabiano G A; Doctoroff G L; Fortson B ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2016.1266648","Keywords":"\nworld","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chacko A, Fabiano G A, Doctoroff G L, and Fortson B (2017) Engaging fathers in effective parenting for preschool children using shared book reading: A randomized controlled trial.

study investigated the effects of a family-centered intervention that involved parents in weekly assessments and daily routine activities for promoting young children’s language and behavior. Forty-one 3–5-year-old children at-risk for language and behavior problems, recruited from three developmental pre-schools, were randomly assigned to a control and an intervention group that received parent–professional support. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to examine whether groups differed on post-test scores on the Test of Early Language Development—Third Edition and Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, using pre-test scores as a covariate. Results showed that children in the intervention group outperformed children in the control group on both tests. The study indicated that familycentered intervention is an effective method for empowering parents to identify and implement concrete solutions to their children’s problems, especially when done as part of a professional collaboration.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chao Pen-Chiang ; Bryan Tanis ; Burstein Karen ; Ergul Cevriye ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-005-0032-4","Keywords":"at-risk children\r\nfamily-centered intervention\r\nparent–professional collaboration\r\nlanguage\r\nbehavior","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chao Pen-Chiang, Bryan Tanis, Burstein Karen, and Ergul Cevriye (2006) Family-centered intervention for young children at-risk for language and behavior problems.

Findings: In Study 1, we observed 32 Chinese kindergarteners playing a number board game with their caregivers in dyads. Number board game playing provided important opportunities for kindergarteners and their caregivers to talk about an array of number concepts, but their numeracy-related exchanges rarely went beyond counting. In Study 2, 88 Chinese kindergarteners and their parents were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups, namely, the game with parent training group, the game without parent training group, the exercise book group, and the control group. After a 4-week intervention, kindergarteners in the 3 treatment groups who began as relatively unskilled in numeracy showed comparable improvement in 3 numeracy tasks, and the effect sizes were often larger in the game with parent training group than in the game without parent training group. Moreover, kindergarteners in the 2 game groups tended to show relatively heightened mathematics interest. Practice or Policy: Findings of these 2 studies suggest that number board game playing has the potential benefit of promoting kindergarteners' numeracy competence and mathematics interest. Training of parents might even optimize kindergarten children's gains from parent-child number board game playing.","Comments":"MDE: This paper has two studies. Please focus on study 2.

Hong Kong Chinese kindergarten children were pretested on the Preschool and Primary Chinese Literacy Scale (PPCLS) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test?Third Edition (PPVT-III), and assigned randomly within schools to 1 of 3 conditions, dialogic reading, typical reading and control. After an 8- week intervention, the children were posttested. Results indicated a significant main group effect for performance on both the PPCLS and the PPVT-III, with children in the dialogic reading group benefiting significantly from the intervention. These results indicate that early literacy-related activities in the home have strong and direct effects on both children's literacy growth and language development in Chinese. The success of the dialogic reading technique in this study contributes to the goal of raising global literacy standards and educational achievement.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 3 arms.

Children were pretested on Chinese character recognition, vocabulary, morphological awareness, and reading interest and then assigned randomly to 1 of 4 conditions: the dialogic reading with morphology training (DR + MT), dialogic reading (DR), typical reading, or control condition. After a 12-week intervention period, the DR intervention yielded greater gains in vocabulary, and the DR + MT intervention yielded greater improvement in character recognition and morphological awareness. Both interventions enhanced children's reading interest. Results confirm that different home literacy approaches influence children's oral and written language skills differently: Shared book reading promotes language development, whereas parents' explicit metalinguistic training within a shared book reading context better prepares children for learning to read.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

this study, we instructed parents and early childhood special education staff in Dialogic Reading, an interactive language facilitation technique. We compared the effects of this instruction on adult and child language during shared book reading and on children's vocabulary growth in three different treatment conditions. Thirty-two children with language delays were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) parent instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (b) staff instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (c) staff instruction without one-on-one shared book reading practice (control group). Children were given standardized tests of vocabulary and were videotaped during shared book reading before and after the 8-week intervention period. Parents and staff showed changes in their shared book reading style consistent with the instruction they had received. After adult instruction in Dialogic Reading, children in all three groups spoke more, made longer utterances, produced more different words, and participated more in shared book reading. The magnitude of change in the children's linguistic performance from pre- to posttest was positively correlated with the magnitude of change in adult behavior. There were no statistically significant changes in children's vocabulary test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with a Vygotskian model in which children's linguistic performance can be enhanced by a supportive social context. © 1999, Sage Publications.

examine the impact of School Home Links activity guide homework on kindergarten Texas Primary Reading Inventory scores. Student Texas Primary Reading Inventory (TPRI) scores were obtained and analyzed for gains in score from the Middle of Year (MOY) and End of Year (EOY) administration. Parents were provided School Home Links Activity Guide Homework to use with their child on a weekly basis for twelve weeks. This group formed an experimental group. A control group did not receive SHL activity guide homework. For the control and experimental group each student's letter/sound score was entered into SPSS for the MOY and EOY TPRI, and average gains were calculated. Groups of students were isolated and analyzed for gain based upon participation in a district reading program, and/or high or low parental involvement in SHL activity guide homework. Research in the upper grades shows that homework completion and parent involvement positively affect student achievement. Students whose parents are involved in their education reap many benefits. These benefits include higher academic achievement (Davies, 1991). Fuller & Olsen (1998), Davies (1991), and Epstein (1995) believe parent involvement is a stronger indicator of student achievement than socioeconomic status, parent education, ethnicity, or any other indicator. The research supports the use of homework for upper grades. The results of this study remain inconclusive for kindergarten age students. This study shows that there is no statistically significant difference between experimental and control group kindergarten TPRI scores when homework is an independent variable.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Davis Jill Marie; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\nMajor Curriculum and Instruction\r\nGenre/Form: Academic theses.\r\nAcademic theses.\r\nreading\r\nparent involvement\r\nkindergarten","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Davis Jill Marie (2004) The impact of parental involvement : A study of the relationship between homework and kindergarten Texas Primary Reading Inventory scores. , Texas A&M University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215276,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"island ofOahu in that state ofHawaii[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5372848,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"located on the urban island ofOahu in that state ofHawaii[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Learning Connections[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215410,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Head Start class-\nrooms\"\n\"Children’s mean age at pretest was 47.10 months (range = 31–56\nmonths)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"126","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Complete pre- and\nposttest data were available for 126 children.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"an emergent literacy and mathematics enrichment curriculum for 3- to\n5-year-old children[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215644,"AdditionalText":"48","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"52% were boys.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5372849,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"urban island[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"DeBaryshe (2007).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215245,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416372,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"For the two sites with multiple classrooms, both\nclassrooms were assigned to the same treatment condition.

Participants were 126 Head Start children, their teachers, and their parents. Matched centers were assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: experimental literacy, experimental math, or control. Teachers in both experimental groups implemented either literacy or math instruction in small groups on a daily basis, and parents and children completed supplementary learning activities at home. The control classroom implemented the ongoing Head Start curriculum. Children in the literacy condition showed the largest gains in phonemic awareness and emergent writing skills; they also made greater gains on emergent reading than did children in the math condition. There were no group differences on expressive vocabulary. Results are discussed in terms of curriculum design and practical issues involved in supporting preschools in the implementation of research-based instructional programs.

head teachers.\nThe experimental preschool children and their mothers were asked to attend\nthe school each Thursday at 3 p.m. from February, 1974, to June, 1974. While\nthe children played under the supervision of auxiliaries, the mothers selected a\nbook to read at home to the children from a supply provided by the primary\nadviser and the county library. The mothers then had tea with the three infants’\nteachers who had volunteered for the project, in an effort to enhance relations\nbetween mothers and teachers. After tea, mothers met in groups chaired by\nteachers. Three mothers had two children involved and each teacher chaired a\nrandom group of 12 mothers.\nIn addition to story books, each mother was\nprovided each week with a typed unit of a programme devised by the child\nguidance department for mothers to administer at home. This programme\nprescribes materials likely to be available in all homes and deals with general\nvocabulary, simple number and relationships of time, space and size. Mothers\nwere asked to spend a total of 30 minutes a day on the book and programme.\nAt the group meetings each mother was asked to say how she fared with the\nchild during the previous week and received suggestions from the other members.\nDiscussion at group meetings often ranged over wider aspects of education\nand child rearing and mothers appeared to be sufficiently reinforced by these\nmeetings to persist in the programme.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Donachy_1976.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215577,"AdditionalText":"Interviews with mothers and teachers also held","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414909,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"maternal attitudes by means of “A Measure of Mother’s Communication and\nControl ”[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Donachy_1976.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215572,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215575,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414909,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"the Stanford-Binet (S-B),[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Donachy_1976.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215493,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215518,"AdditionalText":"5","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414909,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"30 minutes a day[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Donachy_1976.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215517,"AdditionalText":"16","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414909,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"The intervention period ran from February, 1974, to June, 1974, with a\ntwo-week break for the Easter Holidays and testing was completed within a\nmonth before and after this period.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Donachy_1976.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":414909,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"from February, 1974, to June, 1974.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Donachy_1976.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215519,"AdditionalText":"30","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414909,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Mothers\nwere asked to spend a total of 30 minutes a day[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Donachy_1976.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215521,"AdditionalText":"Table 4 on page 37 also provides the common themes provided by mothers in their final interviews","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414909,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"Teachers involved with the school-based and nursery groups were not\ninterviewed formally but in a general discussion of the programme they were\nunanimous in asserting that they found contact with parents much easier and\nmore valuable than they anticipated.

The current study evaluates the efficacy of parent coaching programs designed to enrich home numeracy and literacy environments in Cebu City, Philippines. A total of 673 families with 3- to 5-year-old children were randomly assigned to the numeracy, dialogic reading, early literacy skills training, and control groups. Following the 12-week intervention, children in the 578 families that participated in the posttest generally demonstrated a differential pattern of skill gains according to program content. Children in the numeracy group manifested improved basic and complex numeracy skills, and children in the dialogic reading group demonstrated gains in vocabulary knowledge for words in the books that they were exposed to, as well as print and word awareness, to a limited degree. Children in the early literacy skills training group had improved letter name knowledge, phonological awareness, and print and word awareness skills. Evidence of cross-domain transfer from early literacy skills training to some numeracy skills, as well as variations according to socioeconomic status, level of parental involvement, and teacher assignment in the program, were observed in the results. Results are discussed in relation to the specificity of program effects, cross-domain transfer effects, and improvements needed to maximize intervention program benefits among the children who need them the most.

childhood interventions that target numeracy, language, and literacy skills can help to mitigate negative educational outcomes among young children from low- to middle-income families in developing countries. The current study evaluates the efficacy of parent coaching programs designed to enrich home numeracy and literacy environments in Cebu City, Philippines. A total of 673 families with 3- to 5-year-old children were randomly assigned to the numeracy, dialogic reading, early literacy skills training, and control groups. Following the 12-week intervention, children in the 578 families that participated in the posttest generally demonstrated a differential pattern of skill gains according to program content. Children in the numeracy group manifested improved basic and complex numeracy skills, and children in the dialogic reading group demonstrated gains in vocabulary knowledge for words in the books that they were exposed to, as well as print and word awareness, to a limited degree. Children in the early literacy skills training group had improved letter name knowledge, phonological awareness, and print and word awareness skills. Evidence of cross-domain transfer from early literacy skills training to some numeracy skills, as well as variations according to socioeconomic status, level of parental involvement, and teacher assignment in the program, were observed in the results. Results are discussed in relation to the specificity of program effects, cross-domain transfer effects, and improvements needed to maximize intervention program benefits among the children who need them the most.

childhood interventions that target numeracy, language, and literacy skills can help to mitigate negative educational outcomes among young children from low- to middle-income families in developing countries. The current study evaluates the efficacy of parent coaching programs designed to enrich home numeracy and literacy environments in Cebu City, Philippines. A total of 673 families with 3- to 5-year-old children were randomly assigned to the numeracy, dialogic reading, early literacy skills training, and control groups. Following the 12-week intervention, children in the 578 families that participated in the posttest generally demonstrated a differential pattern of skill gains according to program content. Children in the numeracy group manifested improved basic and complex numeracy skills, and children in the dialogic reading group demonstrated gains in vocabulary knowledge for words in the books that they were exposed to, as well as print and word awareness, to a limited degree. Children in the early literacy skills training group had improved letter name knowledge, phonological awareness, and print and word awareness skills. Evidence of cross-domain transfer from early literacy skills training to some numeracy skills, as well as variations according to socioeconomic status, level of parental involvement, and teacher assignment in the program, were observed in the results. Results are discussed in relation to the specificity of program effects, cross-domain transfer effects, and improvements needed to maximize intervention program benefits among the children who need them the most. ","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 parental engagement groups (Numeracy, Dialogic Reading, Early literacy) and a no treatment control.

The main aim of the study was to investigate the effects of PEEP on the children and families from the community it served. Embedded within this aim were dual objectives: to determine if the intervention had an effect within the community as a whole, and simultaneously to determine whether it had an effect on the sub?group of families who participated in the PEEP weekly sessions. Outcomes in favour of the intervention were found for parents and for children's progress in language and early literacy skills, both at community and sub?group level. The study is located within a discussion of social exclusion, the potentially mediating influence of education and the accessibility of literacy skills to intervention and change.","Comments":"Include\rMainDE: Two reports of the same study are available for data extraction\rESDE: Use Evangelou_Sylva_2007 for post-test only scores (Table 7) as Evangelou 2007 is missing SDs or CIs.\rVerbal comprehension and Early Number concepts as primary, Vocabulary and Phonological awareness as secondaries.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Evangelou Maria ; Brooks Greg ; Smith Sally ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03054980701476477","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Evangelou Maria, Brooks Greg, and Smith Sally (2007) The Birth to School Study: evidence on the effectiveness of PEEP, an early intervention for children at risk of educational under‐achievement.

Some of the techniques that have been used are Hearing Reading, Paired Reading, Shared Reading, Relaxed Reading, Pause, Prompt and Praise and Direct Instruction. Of these techniques, Direct Instruction and Paired Reading have been shown to be the most effective programs using parents within the primary school setting. However, many studies in Paired Reading research have lacked experimental data using parents as tutors in high schools. The aim of this paper was to assess the impact of Paired Reading on the improvement of oral reading in a high school using parents as tutors. The subjects were 38 Year 8 students. A pre-test/post-test experimental control design was used with the two dependant variables of accuracy and comprehension. Specifically, the study sought to determine whether Paired Reading would produce higher levels of reading accuracy and comprehension than the existing school-based reading program.

paper reports on a low cost intervention program implemented into the homes of 34 preschool children at risk of reading failure. The intervention was targeted at families where there was a history of reading disability. Families were instructed in dialogic reading via videotaped examples of good practice. The intervention took place over eight weeks. Pre‐ and post‐ measures of language and literacy were taken for experimental and control groups. The intervention was successful in raising levels of concepts about print for the experimental group; receptive vocabulary and alphabet knowledge improved for the control group. There were no significant changes in measures of expressive vocabulary, rhyme and initial sounds. For students in both groups, gender was associated with rhyme, and concepts of print; parent educational level was associated with alphabet knowledge, and expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fielding-Barnsley Ruth ; Purdie Nola M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19404150209546703","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fielding-Barnsley Ruth, and Purdie Nola M (2002) Developing pre-literacy skills via shared book reading assessment of a family intervention program for pre-school children at risk of becoming reading disabled.

preschoolers from low‐income families participated in a 12‐month intervention programme, funded by Sure Start, which engaged them in scaffolded educational activities delivered at home by their mothers. Immediately following the programme, the intervention group outperformed matched controls in tests of academic knowledge, receptive vocabulary, and inhibitory control, but not short‐term memory or theory of mind. Teachers' ratings of children's capabilities upon school entry favoured the intervention group, especially in terms of listening, responding, writing, mathematics, and personal/social skills. Superior inhibitory control, short‐term memory, and numerical skills were associated with higher ratings whereas theory of mind made a unique, negative contribution to responding. We discuss the implications of these findings for efforts to nurture the development of cognitive self‐regulation and school readiness during early childhood.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ford Ruth M; McDougall Sine J.

In addition to a typical academic year (9 month) program, we also evaluated a shortened summer version of the program (2 months) in which children were treated immediately prior to the start of Kindergarten. Both programs, including the shortened version, significantly improved cognitive test scores by about one quarter of a standard deviation relative to the control group at the end of the year. The shortened version of the program was equally as effective as the academic- year program because most of the gains in the academic-year program occurred within the first few months.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: Preschool group, Kinderprep group and no treatment control.

present the results of a novel early childhood intervention in which disadvantaged 3-4-year- old children were randomized to receive a new preschool and parent education program focused on cognitive and non-cognitive skills (CogX) or to a control group that did not receive preschool education. In addition to a typical academic year (9 month) program, we also evaluated a shortened summer version of the program (2 months) in which children were treated immediately prior to the start of Kindergarten. Both programs, including the shortened version, significantly improved cognitive test scores by about one quarter of a standard deviation relative to the control group at the end of the year. The shortened version of the program was equally as effective as the academic- year program because most of the gains in the academic-year program occurred within the first few months.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: Preschool group, Kinderprep group and no treatment control.

To determine the emergent literacy and language effects of a low-intensity literacy promotion program (Let's Read) provided via universal well-child services to parents during the first 4 years of their child's life. Design Population-based, cluster randomized controlled trial performed between March 1, 2006, and December 10, 2010. Setting Maternal and child health centers (clusters) in 5 relatively disadvantaged local government areas in Melbourne, Australia. Participants All parents attending their 4-week well-child appointments in participating centers were invited to take part in the study. Intervention The Let's Read program was delivered at 4, 12, 18, and 42 months during universal well-child care visits. Main Outcome Measure Child emergent literacy skills (intrasyllabic, phonemic, and sound/letter knowledge) and language (core, receptive, and expressive), measured at 4 years of age. Results A total of 630 parents participated, with 365 children in 32 intervention clusters and 265 children in 33 control clusters; 563 children (89.4%) were retained in the study to 4 years of age. The adjusted mean differences (intervention minus control) for emergent literacy was 0.2 (95% CI, −0.2 to 0.6; P = .29) for intrasyllabic units, 0.05 (95% CI, −0.4 to 0.5; P = .85) for phonemic awareness, and 0.1 (95% CI, −1.5 to 1.6; P = .92) for letter knowledge. For language, the differences were 1.6 (95% CI, −1.1 to 4.3; P = .25) for core, 0.8 (95% CI, −2.0 to 3.7; P = .56) for receptive, and 1.4 (95% CI, −1.4 to 4.2; P = .32) for expressive scores. Conclusion This population-wide primary care literacy promotion and book distribution program provided neither the anticipated benefits to literacy and language nor enhanced uptake of literacy activities at 4 years of age, even when targeted to relatively disadvantaged areas.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goldfeld S ; Quach J ; Nicholls R ; Reilly S ; Ukoumunne O C; Wake M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1001/archpediatrics.2012.1099","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goldfeld S, Quach J, Nicholls R, Reilly S, Ukoumunne O C, and Wake M (2012) Four-year-old outcomes of a universal infant-toddler shared reading intervention: The Let's Read trial.

Examples of the activities include: language, communi-\ncation, numeracy, social-awareness-building skills, listening and observation skills\nsuch as storytelling, guided reading materials with questions for comprehension,\nmatching, sorting/sequencing exercises, counting/measuring, fine motor co-ordination\nexercises using familiar household objects for language/communications activities\nand several gross motor movement exercises. The children are daily taught the\nactivities by their mothers in their respective homes.\"\n\"The second component of the programme is the Mother Support Programme\n(MSP) which provides weekly lectures on effective parenting practices and awareness\nof early childhood development. Some of the weekly topics include: the importance\nof the pre-school years for learning and the mother’s role; characteristics of growth\nand development in the developing child; cognitive development; some aspects of\npersonality development (1 and 2); the importance of play and its contribution to devel-\nopment; safety–first aid and mother–child relationships.

article presents the continued effects of a home-based intervention programme on child development outcomes and parenting practices in Bahrain. The intervention is the Mother–Child Home Education Programme (MOCEP) which was implemented in Arabic in the Kingdom of Bahrain beginning in 2001. One hundred and sixty-seven poor, disadvantaged families were randomly recruited from the 1996 birth cohort; 92 families for the home intervention group and 75 families for the control group. Data were collected over two subsequent testing intervals in 2004 and 2008 when the children were in Primary II and Primary VI levels, respectively. Several child development outcomes and parenting practices and belief measures were compared. Impact study results immediately following the intervention yielded the highest effects on outcomes, and these findings are reported elsewhere. This study reports the effects sustained on some child development outcomes and parenting beliefs well into primary school.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hadeed Julie ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2010.524299","Keywords":"home-based intervention\r\nchild development\r\noutcomes\r\nparenting\r\neffects\r\nBahrain\r\nworld","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hadeed Julie (2011) The continued effects of home intervention on child development outcomes in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

This model sought to enhance student performance by redefining school as the extended family for urban students and parents. A 4-year study concluded that when parents were involved with this process, student achievement and parental commitment to education far surpassed that of students and parents who remained in the more traditional school setting.","Comments":"MDE: Please code FAST students vs same school controls for Classroom 1.

article examines the parent involvement practices and philosophies of an urban education model that has been integral in developing collaborative relationships between parents and schools. This model sought to enhance student performance by redefining school as the extended family for urban students and parents. A 4-year study concluded that when parents were involved with this process, student achievement and parental commitment to education far surpassed that of students and parents who remained in the more traditional school setting.","Comments":"MDE: Please code FAST students vs same school controls for Classroom 4.

Mothers in one group read to their children at least 15 minutes a day from a variety of picture story books considered appropriate for this group of children. The other group of children had the opportunity to take home toys from a toy library, but mothers were not asked to work with the children. As measured by a picture vocabulary test, the children experiencing the reading program made significant gains as compared to the group utilizing the toy library.

present study was conducted to investigate the effect of family literacy programs on developing kindergarten children’s early literacy skills in Qatar. Three hundred and twenty kindergarten children (166 girls and 154 boys; mean age = 4.721 years) participated in the study. The sample was divided into two groups: the experimental group with (162) children whose parents participated in family literacy programs and the control group with (158) children whose parents did not participate. For the purpose of the study, the researchers designed an early literacy test that included five literacy skills: concepts of print, phonological awareness, letter knowledge, vocabulary, and emergent writing. The children in each group were pre-tested and post-tested. The findings indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the two groups as children in the experimental group had higher scores in the early literacy test compared to the control group. Among the sample studied, boys’ and girls’ early literacy scores were not markedly differentiated. Furthermore, the findings indicated that there was no difference due to the interaction between group and gender. In light of these results, recommendations for establishing family literacy programs in Qatari kindergarten settings are addressed.","Comments":"MDE: Results are presented for girls, boys and total. Please use total scores. \nESDE:Please use vocabulary as the primary outcome and writing as secondary.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ihmeideh Fathi ; Al-Maadadi Fatima ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105462","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ihmeideh Fathi, and Al-Maadadi Fatima (2020) The effect of family literacy programs on the development of children’s early literacy in kindergarten settings.

Each family received an explanatory letter from the district administration outlin- ing the program and met with the intervention teachers individually to learn about the scope and intention of the program (only three parents refused to participate). Parents were invited to an evening meeting where the program was further explained and the proposed process of parental involvement outlined. At that meeting an overview of the year's program and an explanation of the research principles involved were given. Concurrently, control families were informed that the project was being carried out, and all agreed to allow their children to be tested as part of a comparison group. The parent training sessions were organized in five 1-month units; in each unit a parent coaching session was led by a trained parent educator, working from a scripted discussion outline to assure fidelity across schools. All relevant information was also included in a take-home guide so that the concepts addressed in the sessions could be reviewed at will. Each parent education session was followed immediately by opportunities to en- gage in structured parent-child activities designed to pro- vide practice in the desired interaction. Each of the subsequent 3 weeks, the teachers sent home a set of scripted activities incorporating the principles that were the focus for that month. These structured activities in- cluded scripted interactions and demonstrations of how to engage children in extended discussions surrounding a book. Each book to be used in the at-home activities was specifically selected because its content and text design offered lexical richness, extended discourse opp\"\n\"ties, and interesting ideas to talk about. Thus, the scripted parent-child interactions fostered the types of high-quality language interactions that research has shown to be ef- fective in promoting language development. The se- quence, including a parent education session during which literacy activities were modeled and opportunities to practice those activities with the child were given and then scripted activities that were sent home from school every week, was repeated for each of the five interven- tion units.

year long intervention project was carried out with 248 kindergarten students, composed of 71 students in a control group and 177 students whose parents participated in an experimental program that included parent education sessions, at-school parent/child activities, and at-home book-mediated activities. The intervention, Early Access to Success in Education (Project EASE), was designed to increase the frequency and quality of language interactions through book-centered activities and to give parents information about and opportunities for engagement in their children's developing literacy abilities. Parents received information about ways to strengthen vocabulary, extend narrative understanding, develop letter recognition and sound awareness, produce narrative retellings, and understand exposition. Measures of home literacy support were collected from parents and a battery of language and literacy tests were adminis- tered to intervention and comparison children prior to the intervention and at its conclusion. Children whose families engaged in the at- school and at-home activities made significantly greater gains in language scores as measured on subtests of vocabulary, story comprehension, and sequencing in story-telling than comparison children. The greatest gains were found in those low-achieving students who started out with low language skills at pretest and strong home literacy support. Parents in general showed high levels of par- ticipation in the prescribed activities, and they reported high levels of satisfaction. The study demonstrates the potential for schools to engage parents in a meaningful way in supporting their children's literacy development, and the sensitivity of children's oral language skills to the impact of structured enrichments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jordan Gail E; Snow Catherine E; Porche Michelle V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1598/RRQ.35.4.5","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nFamily Literacy\r\nEmergent Literacy\r\nPrimary Education\r\nBeginning Reading\r\nKindergarten Children\r\nKindergarten\r\nProgram Descriptions\r\nParent Participation\r\nParent Student Relationship\r\nProgram Effectiveness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jordan Gail E, Snow Catherine E, and Porche Michelle V (2000) Project EASE: The effect of a family literacy project on kindergarten students' early literacy skills.

For each session,\nthe following features were examined: (a) session date, (b)\nnumber of books read (i.e., 0, 1, or 2), (c) duration of\nreading session, and (d) parental use (or non-use) of verbal\nprint-referencing behaviors (parents’ use of nonverbal print\nreferences could not be determined via audiotape).\nAnalysis of control group sessions indicated that during\n96% of sessions (156 out of 162), both target books were\nread in their entirety. Similarly, analysis of experimental\ngroup sessions indicated that both target books were read\nin their entirety during 95% of sessions (137 out of 144)\"\n\"An important consideration in this study was parents’\nuse of print-referencing behaviors, and more specifically,\nthat experimental group parents used these behaviors as\ninstructed and that control group parents did not use these\nbehaviors. Home reading sessions were thus analyzed to\ndetermine the extent to which parents in both groups used\nverbal print-referencing behaviors. Sessions were analyzed\nto document parents’ use of specific print-referencing key\nwords, including word, spell, letter, and sentence, to name\na few. The raw frequency with which parents used these\nprint-referencing key words during each book reading was\ntabulated.\nFor the experimental reading sessions, fidelity measures\nindicated that during 97% of the sessions examined (140\nout of 144), parents used at least nine verbal print­\nreferencing behaviors during the book reading. This\ndemonstrated that print-referencing strategies were used to\na high degree in the experimental group. Control group\nreading sessions were also examined to ensure that parents\nin this group were not using these strategies.

investigation examined the efficacy of a home-based book reading intervention program for enhancing parents' use of print-referencing behaviors and for stimulating children's early literacy skills in the areas of print and word awareness. Participants included 28 parents and their typically developing 4-year-old children. Each dyad was assigned to a control or experimental group, using a pretest-posttest control group research design. Pretest measures of parents' book-reading behaviors and children's early literacy skills were collected. Each dyad then completed a home-based shared reading program, in which they read two books each week over a 4-week period. Parents in the experimental group were instructed to use nonverbal and verbal print referencing behaviors in their reading sessions. Control group parents did not receive this instruction. Posttest measures found that parents in the experimental group showed a significant increase in their use of verbal and nonverbal references to print. Results also indicated that parental use of these print referencing behaviors significantly enhanced their children's early literacy skills in several areas of print and word awareness. Clinical implications of this intervention are discussed.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Parent Readiness Education Project (PREP) on readiness skills and subsequent performance of preschool children.\n\nProcedures. This was an ex-post-facto study using summative evaluative procedures. Seven hundred and thirty-six students from the Ballard, Eastside, Ellis, Howard, and Oak Manor elementary schools in the Niles Community School District, Niles, Michigan, were used in this evaluation. All the subjects had participated in the Title III federally funded PREP screening program which selected those students with anticipated learning problems for PREP training. Two hundred and fifty-nine children received PREP training.\n\nOne-way analysis of variance and one-way analysis of covariance were used to analyze the results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, Caldwell Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills subtests. Simple t-test for independent means and correlated means were used to analyze the pretest and posttest scores of the Caldwell Preschool Inventory.\n\nResults. With the exception of the first annual group, the PREP students made significant gains in readiness skill areas in comparison to the Non-PREP and Non-Accepting PREP students. Follow-up studies at the end of kindergarten right through fourth grades continued to show significance in favor of the PREP group. In almost every case the PREP students had at least caught up with the Non-PREP students, and scored significantly higher than the Non-Accepting PREP group. However, for the first annual group the PREP students failed to close the gap between them and the Non-PREP in nine cases on the CTBS Subtests. Furthermore, they did not surpass the Non-Accepting PREP group in four subtests.\n\nConclusion. The parent-involvement variable of the PREP program is an important factor affecting the readiness skills and performance of preschool children. As a program for early identification and an intervention of learning problems, PREP is an effective project worthy of wider application.","Comments":"ESDE: Use Grade 1 outcomes on CTBS for Groups A, B and C.

Ninety low socioeconomic status preschoolers and their mothers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) e-book reading; (2) printed book reading; (3) regular kindergarten literacy program (control). Mothers of children in the intervention groups received guidance on how to read to their child, and had five sessions of reading within a period of two weeks. The final session was videotaped and transcribed. Children in both intervention groups showed significant progress in word comprehension and phonological awareness compared to the control group. Children's initial knowledge in each skill and both interventions contributed to language progress more than maternal education, frequency of shared book reading and computer use. The authors conclude that parents and children may expand their shared book reading experience to include e-books, which may serve as promising contexts for developing young children's language. © The Author(s) 2013.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: (1) e-book reading; (2) printed book reading; (3) regular kindergarten literacy program (control).

purpose of this study was to examine the effects of teaching parents to deliver a carefully sequenced reading program to their kindergarten children who were not receiving formal reading instruction in school. Forty-five children and their parents enrolled in a kindergarten in a university-sponsored primary school participated in the research. Approximately twice as many children who participated in the home reading program scored in the top quartile of the Woodcock Reading Mastery (WRMT-R) word identification and word attack subtests as might be expected based on the test norms, while the children in the control group approximated the expected norms. On curriculum-based measures, the average score of children in the home reading group was higher than 87% of the children in the control group. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that a significant proportion of the variance in children’s posttest performance was associated with their pretest scores on the WRMT-R letter identification subtest scores, their knowledge of the phonemes introduced in the curriculum and the consistency with which their parents implemented the home reading program.\rThe results are discussed relative to previous research in which teachers implemented the curriculum and the issues associated with utilizing parents as primary beginning reading teachers. In addition, limitations of this research and suggestions for future research are provided.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kraft Benjamin Lignugaris; Findlay Penny ; Major Julie ; Gilberts Guy ; Hofmeister Alan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nReading Research\r\nPrimary Education\r\nReading Skills\r\nProgram Implementation\r\nBeginning Reading\r\nKindergarten\r\nReading Instruction\r\nParent Participation\r\nParents as Teachers\r\nHome Instruction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kraft Benjamin Lignugaris, Findlay Penny, Major Julie, Gilberts Guy, and Hofmeister Alan (2001) The association between a home reading program and young children's early reading skill.

paired reading program was implemented for 195 Hong Kong preschoolers (mean age = 4.7 years) andtheir parents from families with a wide range of family income. The preschoolers were randomlyassigned to experimental or waitlist control groups. The parents in the experimental group received 12sessions of school-based training on paired reading in 7 weeks. They were required to do paired readingwith their children for at least four times in each of these 7 weeks. At the end of the program, the pre-schoolers in the experimental group had better performance in word recognition and reading fluencythan their counterparts in the control group. They were also reported as more competent and motivatedin reading by their parents. More importantly, the program had many favorable effects on parents. Par-ents in the experimental group had higher self-efficacy in helping their children to be better readers andlearners. They also reported that they had better relationships with their children. Their changes in rela-tionships and self-efficacy were found to mediate the program impact on some of the child outcomes.However, family income did not moderate the effectiveness of the program. Families with high andlow income both benefited from the program alike.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lam Shui-fong ; Chow-Yeung Kamfung ; Wong Bernard P.H; Lau Kwok Kiu; Tse Shuk In; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2012.12.003","Keywords":"Paired reading\r\nParental involvement\r\nPreschoolers\r\nFamily income\r\nParenting","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lam Shui-fong, Chow-Yeung Kamfung, Wong Bernard P.H, Lau Kwok Kiu, and Tse Shuk In (2013) Involving parents in paired reading with preschoolers: Results from a randomized controlled trial.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Healthy Start Home Visiting Program—School-Based Model (HSS), using a cluster randomized controlled trial design. Methods: Participants included 224 parents from 20 preschools randomized into intervention and wait-list control groups at the preschool level. Furthermore, 105 parents from the participating preschools were trained as parent ambassadors to assist in program delivery. They were randomized into intervention and control groups at the preschool level. Outcome measures included parent and teacher reports on children’s learning, parent report on children’s behavior and health, their own parenting, and direct assessment of children. Parent ambassadors completed measures on parenting and their children’s behavior before training and after program delivery. Results: There was significant improvement at postintervention in parenting, children’s behavior, and learning and health in the intervention group, compared with the control group. Conclusions: The results provided evidence on the effectiveness of the HSS program.","Comments":"Please focus on comparing pre- vs. post-intervention scores","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Leung Cynthia ; Tsang Sandra ; Heung Kitty ; Tam Mia ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1049731518786578","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Leung Cynthia, Tsang Sandra, Heung Kitty, and Tam Mia (2019) Healthy start home visiting program—School-based model: Cluster randomized controlled trial.

Parents in three groups (119 mothers, 5 fathers) were coached to mediate child learning, respectively, in: interactive storybook reading, writing, or visuomotor skills. A group-specific workshop was followed by 7 weeks of tri-weekly structured dyadic interactions and weekly tutorial home visits. A fourth group (control) received no intervention. Results showed implementation success: Mothers coached in interactive storybook reading or writing mediation improved in the coached activity from pretest to immediate posttest and to delayed posttest. Interactive storybook reading improved less for older than younger children, whereas writing mediation improved more for older than younger children. No transfer emerged from one activity to the other: Coaching on reading had no effect on writing or visuomotor skills, and coaching of writing had an effect only on writing. Children’s alphabetic skills were enhanced in the writing mediation-coached group, whereas linguistic competencies, unexpectedly, were not enhanced in the interactive storybook reading-coached group. The significance of writing mediation as a dyadic activity promoting literacy is emphasized.","Comments":"Coders, please combine scores from all 3 interventions ((interactive storybook reading, writing, or visuomotor skills) vs. control and focus in coding pretest vs. immediate posttest scores.\n","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Levin Iris ; Aram Dorit ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11145-010-9254-y","Keywords":"Language and Literature\r\nPsycholinguistics\r\nEducation, general\r\nNeurology\r\nLiteracy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Levin Iris, and Aram Dorit (2012) Mother–child joint writing and storybook reading and their effects on kindergartners’ literacy: An intervention study.

effects of an interactive shared-reading intervention were evaluated with 3-to 4-year-old children from low-income families who attended subsidized child care. The children entered the program with oral language skills that were significantly below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) no treatment control, (b) a school condition in which children were read to by their teachers in small groups, (c) a home condition in which children were read to by their parents, and (d) a combined school plus home condition. Parents and teachers were trained in a specific form of interactive reading via an instructional videotape. The intervention was conducted for 6 weeks, after which children were posttested on standardized measures of oral language, and language samples were obtained during a shared-reading assessment. Significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and were largest for children in conditions involving home reading.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

examined science learning and motivation outcomes as a function of children\\u0027s participation in the classroom and classroom-plus-home components of the Scientific Literacy Project (SLP). The sample was comprised of kindergarten children in 4 low income, neighboring schools. Children in Schools 1 and 2 (n = 120) participated in the SLP science activities. Of these children, 79 participated in the classroom component of the SLP whereas 41 participated in both the classroom and home components. A comparison group of children in schools 3 and 4 (n = 74) participated in regular science activities. We identified science learning, achievement, and motivational benefits for the SLP groups. Additional benefits for children who participated in both the classroom and home components of the SLP were greater gains in general science knowledge, higher levels of positive self-competence beliefs for science, perceived family support for learning science, and independence for learning science.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 3 groups: 1.

study examined the effects of preschool reading intervention procedures on the knowledge about reading (reading readiness) of the subjects as they entered kindergarten. One such intervention, carried out for two consecutive years, involved giving low and middle income parents packets of several small, easy-to-read books and guidelines for using them with their children when the parents brought their children for preschool screening provided by the school districts in the spring. Children in the first wave (year one) of the study received two additional packets of books by mail during the summer, and children in the second wave (year two) received only the packet at the screening. Children who came to kindergarten the following fall were then tested, and the results were compared with those of control classmates who had received no materials. The first year students were tested at the beginning and end of the year. Year 2 students were tested only in November. A three-variable model (gender, picture vocabulary test score, and treatment type) was used to predict end-of-kindergarten scores on knowledge of words, letters, spelling, and story. Analyses of the reading knowledge of the first year students indicated reliable and longlasting effects of the treatment. The treatment affected not only story reading but also word reading and spelling. Year 2 students showed a smaller instructional effect when compared with control students. Children's story reading was affected by the treatment, but not word reading or spelling. The diminished effect could be explained by either the earlier posttesting date or the provision of fewer materials.","Comments":"We did not find the paper refered in the meta-analysis but we found the report of the paper: McCormick & Mason, 1984.\rMDE: Please code Wave 1 and Wave 2.\rESDE: Please code for Wave 1 and Wave 2 - full data in Tables at end of report.

The sample consisted of 60 mothers paired with their three or four year old children who attended full day preschool. The families were randomly assigned to one of three groups for a twelve week period. The tests used in the study were the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test; the Cultural Language Test—Mean Length of Utterance; the Cultural Language Test—Standard English; and the Conversation—Mean Length of Utterance Measure. Three major findings result from the study: 1. The children of mothers provided with intensive training and practice (Group 1) scored significantly higher on all four tests than did the children whose mothers received minimal help (Group 2) or children whose mothers received no help at all (Group 3). 2. Group 2 children did not score any higher than did Group 3. 3. Group 1 mothers scored significantly higher on all measures. © 1988 Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc.","Comments":"MDE: Please code group 1 vs group 3","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McQueen A B; Washington V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0300443880330111","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McQueen A B, and Washington V (1988) Effect of intervention on the language facility of poor, black adolescent mothers and their preschool children.

(2001) study to determine the effectiveness of the Fast Start parent tutoring program on student success in reading achievement. The current study attempted to enlarge the original study's sample size, include kindergarten students in the program, and determine the optimal length of training time for parents needed. Additionally, data gathered from the parent participants were analyzed including parent' s perceptions of the program, their confidence level in tutoring their child, and the parents' level of mastery of the concepts of tutoring before working with their child. At the beginning of the school year, 36 kindergarten parent-student dyads and 52 first grade parent-student dyads were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or the control group for an 1 1-week study. Parents in the first treatment group received one hour of training and parents in treatment two received two hours of training. Students in both treatment groups received homework material published by Scholastic (Padak & Rasinski, 2005) consisting of poems and differentiated emergent and beginning reading activities and materials. Parents in the control group did not receive training and the students in the control group received poems to take home without the activities. Fall pretest scores from Dynamic Indicators of Basic Literacy Skills (DIBELS) were compared to winter DIBELS scores. Raw score results did not show statistically significant reading gains for the treatment groups, however, more growth was evident in the treatment groups when the instructional recommendation level for each student and their level of being at risk was considered. Parents and students had favorable comments about the program.

Children assessed on two standardized reading tests showed statistically significant differences after 6 months, but these differences later disappeared. When analyses were limited to those pairs of children in which the parent of the experimental group child had participated more completely in the tutoring program, there were both immediate and long-term statistically significant differences between the groups. It is concluded that parent tutoring programs can be an effective supplement to compensatory education programs but a substantial number of parents do not participate in such programs. The failure to account for degree of participation in previous research on parent involvement may account for the contradictory findings often reported.","Comments":"SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - Compensatory Education 1978ER5 3164ER5 1967 3150; 6848ER5 7603ER5 3831ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 3947ER5 6823 3932 8016 4542 7577 3816; Parent Participation 7576ER5 7641ER5 912ER5 7550 7615 909; 8208ER5 3366ER5 3382ER5 3164ER5 3098ER5 8179 3352 3368 3150 3085; Reading Difficulties 8667ER5 8264ER5 8635 8234; 8676ER5 5016ER5 8644 4999; Reading Instruction 8678ER5 5259ER5 8646 5242; 8693ER5 5811ER5 9726ER5 1ER5 8655ER5 11271ER5 8661 8623 11225 1 5792 9690; 8835ER5 8832ER5 5259ER5 8678ER5 8654ER5 6120ER5 5771ER5 8803 8800 5242 8622 5752 6101 8646; Tutoring 11099ER5 5074ER5 5259ER5 11055 5057 5242\rCODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The version of the Programme evaluated by this study (Peep-LTS) consisted of an initial home visit, then 20 weekly one-hour sessions held in the nursery setting, delivered by nursery practitioners and attended by parents and their child. The sessions provided parents with background information about how children learn and practical ideas and activities to help parents build on what they were already doing at home to make the most of everyday learning opportunities including listening, talking, playing, singing, and sharing books and stories. The Programme was evaluated via a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess effectiveness in improving language and literacy in the early years and explore the impact on the home learning environment and parental skills. The research team undertook semi-structured interviews with practitioners and parents in intervention settings; a usual practice survey was administered to all settings at the beginning of the trial and to control settings at the end, and an implementation survey was administered to all intervention settings during the trial. The evaluation project operated between January 2017 and December 2018, with the trial intervention period starting in January 2018 and ending in July 2018. In total, the evaluation involved 1,447 families across 139 nursery settings: approximately ten children and parents per setting. This report is published without the deprivation and subgroup analysis due to delays in accessing the relevant data from the National Pupil Database; this analysis will be reported at a later date as an addendum to the current report. EEF security rating These findings have a moderate to high security rating. This was an efficacy trial, which tested whether the intervention worked under developer-led conditions. It was a well-designed randomised controlled trial; however, 20% of the pupils who started the trial were not included in the final analysis, most commonly due to the child being absent on the day of testing and subsequent follow-up data collection days. Additional findings Key factors that supported successful implementation were the training delivered by the Peeple project delivery team, support from school leaders, the structure of the Programme, and time and resources being available for practitioners to deliver. Ongoing support was also available to practitioners through Peeple ‘mentors’ who supported schools through the set-up of the study, provided training, and became the first point of contact for settings delivering the Programme.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Miller S ; Dunne L ; Smith A ; Laishley A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miller S, Dunne L, Smith A, and Laishley A (2020) Peep Learning Together Programme - Evaluation report.

Using techniques such as puppets, and props for story telling as well.\nParents received a storyboard made of corrugated cardboard. The triangular\nshaped material had a piece of felt on one side and the other was designed for\nroll stories. The storyboard also served as a puppet stage. Each parent received\nstory characters made of felt, stick puppets with accompanying storybooks to\nuse with their storyboard.

Children could write and draw\ntheir own stories or recreate stories they had read by making felt figures, stick\npuppets, or roll stories.

purpose of the study was to bridge home and school literacy contexts by involving families in literacy activities with their children to enhance children's achievement and interest in reading and writing. The literature‐based school program included, literacy centers in classrooms, teacher modelled literature activities, and writing and reading appreciation periods called WRAP Time when children worked on literacy activities in a social context. The home program had similar features with parents and children engaging in storybook reading, recording very own words from the environment, writing journals, storytelling and the use of Highlights for Childrer magazine. Monthly meetings with parents and children allowed for, sharing ideas, finding out what parents and children wanted to learn, and the opportunity for families to work together. The program was carried out in an urban school district which included African‐American and Latino families of children in the first grade. Pre and posttests were administered to determine growth in achievement and interest in reading. The achievement and motivation data demonstrated a significant difference in favor of the children in the family program. Success was attributed to the collaboration and shaping of the program by parents, teachers, and children in an atmosphere of mutual respect.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morrow Lesley Mandel; Young John ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0300443971270103","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morrow Lesley Mandel, and Young John (1997) A collaborative family literacy program: The effects on children's motivation and literacy achievement.

Verbal directions are given by the parent who reads a script printed on the exercise itself. For each of the ten program units taught during the year, there are eight Practice Exercises.

From a sample of 40 Newfoundland schools, schools were grouped into rural village (drawing students from one small community), rural collector (drawing students from several small communities), and urban, and four schools were randomly selected from each grouping. Schools were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups (Little Books used in the home only, LittleBooks used in the home and school, Little Books used in the school only, and control). Complete pretest and posttest data were obtained for 309 children. Quantitative analyses showed the children entering kindergarten in this study to be at risk of school failure. On average, urban kindergartners scored higher on all measures, and village and collector students scored about the same. Differences in posttest means were not related clearly to treatment. However, the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Pretest x Treatment interaction, which showed that the lowest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they were used at home only, and the highest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they used them in school only, helps to support the hypothesis that the home has a crucial role to play in literacy development.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

Thirty-three low-income parents of 4-year-old children attending Head Start were randomly assigned to either dialogic reading, elaborative reminiscing, or a control condition. Parents in the intervention conditions were trained to implement specific and prescribed conversational techniques. Children's vocabulary, narrative, and print skills were assessed at the beginning (pretest) and at the end (posttest) of the school year. Elaborative reminiscing boosted the quality of children's narratives in comparison to dialogic reading. Elaborative reminiscing was also effective in supporting children's story comprehension. These training effects were present regardless of the children's ethnic background and whether they were bilingual. Practice: Training parents in elaborative reminiscing is a promising alternative to training in shared book reading for enhancing children's narrative development in non-mainstream populations. Parent training programs in elaborative reminiscing may also complement dialogic reading programs that take place in preschool classrooms.

Parents receive a text message directly from EasyPeasy which links to videos of example games that they can play with their children, plus tips and advice about learning through play. The games target skills within the Early Years Foundation Stage areas of learning. This project aimed to support children aged three to four in school nurseries. The intervention lasted 20 weeks, with parents receiving weekly texts linked to 65 games over this period. Use of EasyPeasy was supported by a member of nursery staff (the ‘Pod Leader’), trained by EasyPeasy. One hundred and two primary schools from nine Local Authorities across England participated in this efficacy trial from September 2017 to July 2018. The programme was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial, testing the impact of EasyPeasy on children’s language development compared to ‘business as usual’ in control schools using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) assessment. Social, emotional, and behavioural outcomes were also assessed; 1,205 children were included in the evaluation. Interviews, case studies, focus groups, and a survey were conducted to explore how the programme was implemented and to obtain feedback from participants. EEF security rating The primary finding has a moderate to high security rating. This was an efficacy trial, which tested whether the intervention worked under everyday conditions in a large number of schools. It was a well-designed randomised controlled trial and few pupils who started the trial were not included in the final analysis: one school (1%) withdrew from the trial and did not allow post-testing to be conducted, and 6% of pupils randomised with pre-tests had missing data. There was some imbalance on language scores at baseline, which reduces the security rating. All results were confirmed by additional analyses. Additional findings. Small, non-statistically-significant effects in favour of the intervention group were observed in the individual CELF. subscale scores, each equating to a month or less of progress. Small effect sizes in favour of the intervention group were found for the CSBQ subscales of ‘sociability’, ‘emotional self regulation’, and ‘cognitive self-regulation’ (effect sizes 0.04, 0.06, and 0.14). The positive effect on cognitive self regulation is consistent with previous evaluations of EasyPeasy, and here, it is based on a teacher (rather than parent) measure. However, it is also important to note that the effect here is substantially smaller and not statistically significant.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Robinson-Smith L ; Menzies V ; Cramman H ; Wang Y ; Fairhurst C ; Hallett S ; Beckmann N ; Merrell C ; Torgerson C ; Stothard S ; Siddiqui N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Robinson-Smith L, Menzies V, Cramman H, Wang Y, Fairhurst C, Hallett S, Beckmann N, Merrell C, Torgerson C, Stothard S, and Siddiqui N (2019) EasyPeasy: Learning through play - Evaluation report. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215602,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416358,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"evaluated the differential impact of three early literacy interventions—\ntutoring, classroom activities, and work with families—on the emergent literacy skills of low-income\nCosta Rican kindergarteners[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rolla (2006).pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416358,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 6:\n[¬s]\"hypothesis was that the intervention as implemented in Costa Rica would most\nprobably have an impact on vocabulary.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rolla (2006).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416358,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"The family intervention was a Spanish-language adaptation of Project EASE (Jordan et[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Rolla (2006).pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215240,"AdditionalText":"again, we are only interested in one specific treatment (family intervention) & I answered yes here, please let us know if you want us to answer no","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215251,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416358,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Within classrooms, children were grouped into homogeneous blocks based on\ntheir scores at the beginning of the year on the letter identiﬁcation task (a proxy for\nincoming emergent literacy skills), and then children within each block were randomly\nassigned to a treatment condition.

retention has been the de facto policy for children with academic difficulties in many Latin American countries [Schiefelbein, E., & Wolff, L. (1992). Repetition and inadequate achievement in Latin America’s primary schools: a review of magnitudes, causes, relationships, and strategies. Washington, DC: World Bank.]. In Costa Rica, 14.9% of public school children were retained in first grade in 2002. In a study of first grade classrooms in Costa Rica, children identified as in need of repeating first grade were found to have lower levels of reading ability [Rolla San Francisco, A., Arias, M., Villers, R., & Snow, C. (in press). The importance of reading skills, prereading skills, and family in teachers’ decisions to retain children: a case study in costa rica. Aula Abierta]. There has been a greater focus in recent years on the importance of prevention of educational difficulties, versus repetition, as the most cost-effective and efficient way of providing educational opportunities to low-income children. There is little rigorous research evaluating the impact of different interventions on the early literacy skills of low-income children in developing countries as a way to prevent posterior academic difficulties. This experimental study evaluated the differential impact of three early literacy interventions—tutoring, classroom activities, and work with families—on the emergent literacy skills of low-income Costa Rican kindergarteners. Tutoring or a combination of all three interventions were the most effective, while providing high-quality materials to teachers without training had no impact, but more intensive interventions of longer duration will probably be needed to ensure long-term impact on first grade repetition and eventual school dropout. Continuing research will assess the impact of these interventions on student outcomes and repetition rates in first grade, as well as exploring the impact of the more intensive intervention of professional development.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 6 arms.

study evaluates the impact of a linguistic and cognitive development program for 5- year-old children. The program was implemented undergoing two conditions. In the first condition, the children participated in activities in their preschool classroom (extensive condition), while the second condition also involved family literacy activities in the children’s homes (intensive condition). The program’s impact was evaluated by using a pre-test – post-test design. The tests for receptive vocabulary (RV), category production (CP) and writing were administered to a sample of 214 children who participated in the intensive condition, 69 who participated in the extensive condition, and a control group of 49 children from Buenos Aires who did not participate in the program. The results showed that participation in the intensive condition led to a greater increase in RV, CP and writing abilities than the extensive condition and that both experimental conditions showed a greater increase in skill level when compared with the control group. The mother’s education level and previous preschool attendance seemed to have no effect. The results showed significant correlations between all of the variables analyzed and that the RV scores at the beginning of the year predicted both the RV and writing scores at the end of the year.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: the intensive condition (Group A), the extensive condition (Group B), the control group (Group C).

We present results from a randomized control trial evaluating a digital app (Measure Up!) and a parent companion app (Super Vision) designed to teach children measurement concepts, a skill that many teachers do not feel comfortable teaching. Ninety-nine 4- and 5-year-old children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Measure Up!, Super Vision + Measure Up!, or a control game. Analyses revealed a statistically significant effect of being in the treatment group (Measure Up! or Measure Up! + Super Vision) on children's posttest scores (about two additional questions correct), controlling for the pretest and demographic characteristics (gender, SES). In particular, gains were made for children's understanding of pan balances. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Results suggest that apps can be designed to help children learn important mathematics skills; however, more research needs to be done to understand how parent supports can be better designed. Implications for evaluation and design of game-based learning tools are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: a) Measure Up!

childhood nutritional interventions typically combine nutritional and psychosocial stimulation. Such combined interventions result in long-lasting improvements of cognitive abilities in children who are malnourished. Here, we investigated potential cognitive abilities in normally developing children in Indonesia who were, however, at risk for suboptimal cognitive development due to little psychosocial stimulation in their home environment. In a randomized controlled intervention, children of the experimental group received nutritional supplementation combined with cognitive stimulation. Pre- and post-intervention measurements included cognitive development and functioning, behavior, and mother–child interaction. The experimental and control group received nutritional supplementation in the form of a fortified or unfortified milk powder, respectively. Additionally, the children and parents of the experimental group jointly engaged in daily learning activities at home and performed iPad-based tasks designed to foster cognitive abilities. The experimental group compared to the control group displayed a significantly higher increase in intelligence quotient as well as a significantly larger reduction in attentional problems after the intervention. These results indicate that low-level cognitive stimulation in combination with nutritional supplementation during early childhood can be an effective intervention that improves global cognitive functioning in healthy developing children.","Comments":"ESDE: WPPSI-IV composite scores as primary, reduction of attention as secondary outcomes (p.7, means & SEs)","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schneider Nora ; Geiser Eveline ; Gosoniu Laura M; Wibowo Yulianti ; Gentile-Rapinett Gertrude ; Tedjasaputra Mayke S; Sastroasmoro Sudigdo ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu10101394","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schneider Nora, Geiser Eveline, Gosoniu Laura M, Wibowo Yulianti, Gentile-Rapinett Gertrude, Tedjasaputra Mayke S, and Sastroasmoro Sudigdo (2018) A combined dietary and cognitive intervention in 3⁻5-year-old children in Indonesia: A randomized controlled trial.

The first workshop briefly discussed\nthe important role that parents play in supporting children's academic success and included a\nbroad overview of research evidence linking parental involvement to academic achievement.\nThe bulk of the workshop, however, was spent discussing parent-child shared book reading.\nThe workshop included a discussion on the role of shared book reading for children's reading\ndevelopment and information on how to choose books that support early reading acquisition.\"\n\"parents learned that shared\nbook reading is important for growth in children's vocabulary, general knowledge, and\ncomprehension, and children's increasing understanding of print concepts and syntactic\nstructure. The workshop presentation discussed how each of these skills is related to\nchildren's reading ability. The group also discussed the importance of creating a relaxed,\nsupportive environment during shared book reading, and that parents need to structure the\nbook reading experience so that children enjoy reading.\"\n\"To ensure that children are enjoying books, the workshop presented tips for choosing\n'good books' - books that children enjoy but are also useful for teaching phonological\nawareness and word reading. The workshop included information on the importance of\npattern, of repetitive phrases or words, of lyrical or rhythmic flow in the text, and of content\nthat appeals to children's interests.\nAt the end of the first session, the facilitator read each of the five books used for the\nchildren's camp program, demonstrating different characteristics of the books and different\ntechniques for shared reading. The techniques demonstrated how different types of books\ncould be used to support growth in children's vocabulary, general knowledge, and\ncomprehension, and children's understanding of print concepts and syntactic structure[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Seward_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416112,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 59:\n[¬s]\"Parents were encouraged to be 'expressive' readers so that, in addition to learning emergent\nliteracy skills, children also would be entertained by the book reading experience.\"\n\"The second workshop focused on phonological awareness specifically. This session\nincluded an explanation of phonological awareness and an explanation of its importance for\nreading acquisition. Parents learned that there were three types of phonological awareness\n(syllable, rhyme, and phoneme) that most often develop in sequence. Parents learned to\nrecognize their own child's level of phonological awareness and were shown how to focus\nchildren's learning at their current level.\"\n\"The second part of the workshop presented different types of phonological awareness\nskills. To demonstrate, the workshop facilitator described the phonological awareness items\nin the assessment battery. The test battery includes tasks where children are asked to identify,\nsegment, and blend phonological units. Parents also learned that other tasks, not used in this\nassessment battery, ask children to manipulate or substitute phonological units. Parents were\nasked to consider these types of activities (identifying, segmenting, blending, and\nmanipulating) when thinking of different phonological awareness activities for their own\"\n\"At the end of this workshop, parents worked in small groups to discuss the ways that\nphonological activities could be incorporated into home routines. After working in small\ngroups, parents presented different phonological awareness activities that they could perform\nat home.

the influence of a summer intervention for children showing early signs of reading delay. The project evaluated two intervention components: a two week camp for children and two training workshops for parents. Data were collected for five groups of participants. Three groups participated in one or more intervention components: parent workshops only group, child camp only group, and both parent workshops and child camp group. All children who participated in the interventions were identified by teachers as having difficulty in phonological awareness and word reading skills at the end of senior kindergarten. Two additional groups served as comparisons. Children in the 'low' comparison group had early literacy skills similar to children in the intervention groups. The 'average' comparison group included children that were identified by teachers as normally achieving in early literacy. The intervention programs sought to improve children's word reading ability by providing explicit instruction in phonological awareness and opportunities to practice other emergent literacy skills. Children participated in pre- and post-test assessments measuring literacy skills and general cognitive skills. Children in all three intervention groups showed positive change following the intervention compared to a comparison group of children with similar initial abilities who did not receive any intervention. Children who received both intervention components showed the most positive change following a follow-up assessment at the end of grade one. The frequency of home literacy activities with parents was related to positive improvement in children's phonological awareness and word reading skills. The quality of home literacy activities is also thought to be important.

study investigated whether increasing the motivation/interest for children and their families to engage in more frequent and higher quality shared book reading interactions will significantly increase the vocabulary and reading/reading readiness abilities of school-aged and preschool children. Subjects were 30 preschool and 30 school-aged children and their families from Kankakee County, Illinois, who signed up for the research (57 completed the study). They were divided into treatment groups and control groups for each age level and location--Kankakee and Bourbonnais. Children were pretested; t-tests were conducted, and test scores were not found to be significantly different for each group. Treatment group children were located at Kankakee, and control group children were located at Bourbonnais. Parents kept a running record on forms provided of how many books they read with their children during the program's period. Re-reading was allowed, and each reading counted as a separate event on the list. Parents in the two treatment groups were given a \"Book Reading Suggestions\" sheet with eight ways to improve book reading quality, and whether parents followed these suggestions was monitored. The most books read by any family was 56; the median number of books read was 29. Findings suggest that receptive vocabulary and reading ability appear to develop along separate lines.

Parental engagement with children has beenlinked to a number of adaptive characteristics in preschoolers includinglanguage and literacy development, and family–school collaboration is animportant contributor to school readiness. This study reports the resultsof a randomized trial of a parent engagement intervention designed tofacilitate school readiness among disadvantaged preschool children, witha particular focus on language and literacy development. Participantsincluded 217 children, 211 parents, and 29 Head Start teachers in 21schools.

Parent use of the reading strategies at home\nwas supported and assessed in two ways during each week of the intervention: weekly phone\ncalls from the researcher and parent-completed logs. At each phone call, parents were asked\nthe number of times they were able to read with their child, whether they were encountering\nany problems and how the child enjoyed reading the book. They were reminded about the\nstrategies to use and asked to return the book with the log sheet at the end of the week in\norder to receive the next book.\"\n\"Parents recorded the number of times they read the book to the\nchild in the log sheet and could write down any comments about the reading sessions or the\nbook.

pragmatic randomised controlled trial was used to investigate the effects of two forms of shared reading on children's language and literacy skills. Parents of 80 children in the preparatory year of school participated in an eight-week home reading intervention. Families were assigned to one of three groups: dialogic reading (DR), dialogic reading with the addition of print referencing (DR + PR), or an attention-matched control group. Analyses of change from pre- to post-intervention showed significant effects for the DR and DP+PR groups compared to the control group on three of the six emergent literacy measures: expressive language, rhyme, and concepts about print. At three-month follow-up assessment, the two intervention groups maintained significantly better performance on the measure of concepts about print only. These findings illustrate the potential of a brief home-based intervention for promoting children's emergent literacy.","Comments":"There are 3 arms: a) dialogic reading (DR), b) dialogic reading + print reference (DR+PR), c) control.

educational opportunities of U.S. children and adults by integrating community early childhood education and adult education for parents into a unified family literacy initiative. This document is the final project report of the National Evaluation of the Even Start Family Literacy Program, a 4-year effort designed to describe types of Even Start projects that were funded, the services provided, the collaborative efforts undertaken, and obstacles to implementation that were encountered. The 13 chapters discuss: (1) program background; (2) program design and evaluation; (3) in-depth descriptions of several participating literacy projects; (4) characteristics of program participants, projects, and staff; (5) participation in and amount of services; and (6) assessing effects of Even Start on participants. Effects discussed were those on children, parent literacy, parenting skills, and family life. Program cost is discussed, and a summary and conclusions of the evaluation are also presented. This summary notes that Even Start produced some positive short-term effects on children and adults, although those effects vary greatly across projects. On average, the resulting gains were no greater than those that similarly motivated families would obtain from locally available services. For Even Start to have a larger effect, the program would need to provide services more intensively.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"St Pierre R ; Swartz J ; Gamse B ; Murray S ; Deck D ; Nickel P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"St Pierre R, Swartz J, Gamse B, Murray S, Deck D, and Nickel P (1995) National evaluation of Even Start Family Literacy Program: Final report.

The report details findings from the third national Even Start evaluation. The evaluation included two complementary studies: the Even Start Performance Information Reporting System (ESPIRS), which provided annual data on the universe of Even Start projects, and the Experimental Design Study (EDS) which examined Even Start effectiveness in 18 projects. The report draws on data collected in all four years of the ESPIRS as well as pretest and posttest data for 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 collected from the 18 EDS projects. Findings include the following: (1) While Even Start children and parents made gains on literacy assessments and other measures, children and parents in the 18 programs did not gain more than those in the control group, about one-third of whom received early childhood education or adult education services; (2) compared to Head Start, Even Start parents are much less likely to have a high school diploma, and Even Start families have substantially lower household income; (3) Even Start children and parents made small gains on literacy measures and scored low compared to national norms when they left the program; (4) families do not take full advantage of the services offered by Even start projects, participating in a small amount of instruction relative to their needs and program goals; (5) while early childhood classroom experiences provided by the EDS projects were of overall good quality, there was not sufficient emphasis on language acquisition and reasoning to produce measurable impacts and hence to achieve legislative outcomes; and (6) the extent to which parents and children participated in literacy services is related to child outcomes.

randomized experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of Even Start, a federally supported family literacy program providing early childhood education, adult education, parenting education, and joint parent-child literacy activities to children and parents from low-literate families. The evaluation of 18 Even Start projects followed 463 families for 2 years and found no statistically significant or educationally important impacts on Even Start families when they were compared with control families on child literacy outcomes, parent literacy outcomes, or parent-child interactions. The study concludes that Even Start projects were able to properly implement family literacy programs, and the observed lack of effectiveness is attributed to a combination of 2 factors: (a) a lack of full participation on the part of families and (b) instructional services that may be ineffective because of the curriculum content or the instructional approach.

first national education goal, school readiness, recognizes a need for young children to be better prepared for entry into elementary school. Many low-income children exhibit a pattern of underachievement in school mathematics. Research has revealed a developmental gap between low-income preschool children and their middle-class peers with respect to the extent of their numerical knowledge. Research has also found that many low-income children do not receive a broad base of support for mathematical development at home or in preschool. In each of two studies, we conducted a bi-generation (parent and child) mathematics intervention with Head Start families. The intervention was designed to enhance parental support for pre-kindergarten children's mathematical development. It was found that low-income parents were willing and able to support this area of their children's development once they were provided with the training to do so. The support that parents provided to their children through the intervention was clearly effective in enhancing the development of children's informal mathematical knowledge. Intervention children developed more extensive mathematical knowledge than a comparison group of low-income children. Thus, an important step toward achieving the school readiness goal can be taken by fostering low- income parents' support for young children's mathematical development.","Comments":"Please code study 1","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Starkey Prentice ; Klein Alice ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15566935eed1105_7","Keywords":"world","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Starkey Prentice, and Klein Alice (2000) Fostering parental support for children's mathematical development: An intervention with Head Start families.

Many low-income children exhibit a pattern of underachievement in school mathematics. Research has revealed a developmental gap between low-income preschool children and their middle-class peers with respect to the extent of their numerical knowledge. Research has also found that many low-income children do not receive a broad base of support for mathematical development at home or in preschool. In each of two studies, we conducted a bi-generation (parent and child) mathematics intervention with Head Start families. The intervention was designed to enhance parental support for pre-kindergarten children's mathematical development. It was found that low-income parents were willing and able to support this area of their children's development once they were provided with the training to do so. The support that parents provided to their children through the intervention was clearly effective in enhancing the development of children's informal mathematical knowledge. Intervention children developed more extensive mathematical knowledge than a comparison group of low-income children. Thus, an important step toward achieving the school readiness goal can be taken by fostering low- income parents' support for young children's mathematical development.","Comments":"Please code study 2","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Starkey Prentice ; Klein Alice ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15566935eed1105_7","Keywords":"world","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Starkey Prentice, and Klein Alice (2000) Fostering parental support for children's mathematical development: An intervention with Head Start families.

preschoolers rapidly acquire new information from social partners but do not learn efficiently from people on video. We trained parents to use Whitehurst’s dialogic reading questioning techniques while watching educational television with their children. Eighty-one parents coviewed storybook videos with their 3-year-old children in 1 of 4 conditions: dialogic questioning (pause, ask questions, and encourage children to tell parts of the story), directed attention (pause and comment but do not ask questions), dialogic actress (show the videos with dialogic questioning by an on-screen actress embedded in them), or no intervention (show the videos as usual). After 4 weeks, children in the dialogic questioning group scored higher than children in the directed attention and no-intervention groups on story comprehension and story vocabulary measures. Scores from the dialogic actress group fell in between. On a standardized measure of expressive vocabulary, children in the 2 parent-interaction groups exhibited significant improvement over their pretest scores. Results indicate that parent-led questioning enhances children’s learning from video stories at age 3 and that a video incorporating an on-screen dialogic questioner may also be effective. Mechanisms behind the effect of dialogic reading-style interventions are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: There are 4 conditions: a) dialogic questioning (pause, ask questions, and encourage children to tell parts of the story), b) directed attention (pause and comment but do not ask questions), c) dialogic actress (show the videos with dialogic questioning by an on-screen actress embedded in them), or d) no intervention (show the videos as usual).

Low levels of literacy and high levels of behaviour problems in middle childhood often co‐occur. These persistent difficulties pose a risk to academic and social development, leading to social exclusion in adulthood. Although parent‐training programmes have been shown to be effective in enabling parents to support their children's development, very few parent interventions offer a combination of behavioural and literacy training. Aims. This paper (1) reports on a prevention programme which aimed to tackle behaviour and literacy problems in children at the beginning of school, and (2) presents the effects of the intervention on children's literacy. Sample. One hundred and four 5‐ and 6‐year‐old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods. This is a randomized control trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. The behavioural intervention consisted of the ‘Incredible Years’ group parenting programme combined with a new programme designed to train parents to support their children's reading at home. Results. Analyses demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on children's word reading and writing skills, as well as parents' use of reading strategies with their children. Conclusion. A structured multicomponent preventive package delivered with attention to fidelity can enable parents to support their children's reading at home and increase their literacy skills. Together with the improvement in child behaviour, these changes could improve the life chances of children in disadvantaged communities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sylva Kathy ; Scott Stephen ; Totsika Vasiliki ; Ereky‐Stevens Katharina ; Crook Carolyn ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1348/000709907X255718","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sylva Kathy, Scott Stephen, Totsika Vasiliki, Ereky‐Stevens Katharina, and Crook Carolyn (2008) Training parents to help their children read: A randomized control trial.

In the TL condition, the focus of the parent meetings was on technology-enhanced storytelling with real-time interaction support. AL and TL children were compared to a control\ncondition consisting of children involved in a preschool program [...].\nThe family literacy program used in the current study was the Dutch program ‘Early Education at Home’ (In Dutch: VVE Thuis, developed by the Dutch Youth Institute, 2014). The key element of the program was to improve linguistic input quality and sensitive responsiveness. To achieve this, the program classiﬁed theoretical elements of linguistic input quality and sensitive responsiveness (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Hoff, 2003) into ﬁve general guidelines for parent-child interaction. These guidelines were (1) involve your child in conversations, (2) encourage your child, (3) provide\nrules and structure, (4) recognize your child’s needs, (5) provide autonomy. The general guidelines were used to provide practical examples of speciﬁc interaction behavior during the parent meetings. Every six weeks parents received a workbook with eight activities to be conducted at home (i.e., shared reading, storytelling activities, memory games, puzzles, songs and rhymes, arts and craft activities, and daily activities). During 1.5-h parent group meetings, parents were trained on interaction behavior to be performed during these activities.

The effects of these programs are limited, partly because they appear to give insufficient guidance and support to parents in changing how they interact with their children. To increase the impact of family literacy programs, two ways to support parents in changing their interaction behavior were examined: active learning during parent group meetings (AL) and technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL). The effects on vocabulary were investigated in children involved in preschool education programs. In an experimental design with partially randomized clusters, 223 preschool children were enrolled in a family literacy program with AL, TL or in the control condition without a family literacy program. Results showed that children in the AL condition made larger receptive vocabulary gains than control children, whereas TL children showed similar gains to controls. Children in all three conditions made similar gains in productive vocabulary. These results demonstrate the strength of AL and shows the complexity of implementing TL.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: a) active learning during parent group meetings (AL), b) technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL), c) control.

In the TL condition, the focus of the parent meetings was on technology-enhanced storytelling with real-time interaction support. AL and TL children were compared to a control\ncondition consisting of children involved in a preschool program [...].\nThe family literacy program used in the current study was the Dutch program ‘Early Education at Home’ (In Dutch: VVE Thuis, developed by the Dutch Youth Institute, 2014). The key element of the program was to improve linguistic input quality and sensitive responsiveness. To achieve this, the program classiﬁed theoretical elements of linguistic input quality and sensitive responsiveness (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Hoff, 2003) into ﬁve general guidelines for parent-child interaction. These guidelines were (1) involve your child in conversations, (2) encourage your child, (3) provide\nrules and structure, (4) recognize your child’s needs, (5) provide autonomy. The general guidelines were used to provide practical examples of speciﬁc interaction behavior during the parent meetings. Every six weeks parents received a workbook with eight activities to be conducted at home (i.e., shared reading, storytelling activities, memory games, puzzles, songs and rhymes, arts and craft activities, and daily activities). During 1.5-h parent group meetings, parents were trained on interaction behavior to be performed during these activities. Parent groups consisted of, on average, 12 parents (ranging from 6 to 25 parents, with the larger groups being divided into subgroups during the meeting) to allow active group interactions.

The effects of these programs are limited, partly because they appear to give insufficient guidance and support to parents in changing how they interact with their children. To increase the impact of family literacy programs, two ways to support parents in changing their interaction behavior were examined: active learning during parent group meetings (AL) and technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL). The effects on vocabulary were investigated in children involved in preschool education programs. In an experimental design with partially randomized clusters, 223 preschool children were enrolled in a family literacy program with AL, TL or in the control condition without a family literacy program. Results showed that children in the AL condition made larger receptive vocabulary gains than control children, whereas TL children showed similar gains to controls. Children in all three conditions made similar gains in productive vocabulary. These results demonstrate the strength of AL and shows the complexity of implementing TL.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: a) active learning during parent group meetings (AL), b) technology-enhanced learning with real-time interaction support (TL), c) control.

In the study a pre- post-test control group design was used. The data were obtained using the General Information Form, developed by the researchers, the Cognitive Process Skills Evaluation Form and Semi-Structured Interview Form. The study group consists of 60 children (30 in the experimental group, 30 in the control group) receiving preschool education in the spring semester of 2016-2017 academic year. The cooperative learning-based science education program with family involvement include activities such as eddies, shadows, mirrors, plants\\u0027 breathing, water power, etc. that can support scientific process skills of children. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22 package program. Since the data has no normal distribution, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for intra-group comparisons and Paired Sample t Test was used for inter-group comparisons. As a result of the study, a significant difference between experimental and control groups was found in favor of the experimental group in the development of scientific process skills of children. According to this result, it can be said that cooperative learning with family involvement-based education program supports the scientific process skills of children of 5-6 years of age. It may be suggested that cooperative learning with family involvement-based science education should be included and popularized in preschool education.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ulutaş Ayşegül ; Kanak Mehmet ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.14704/NQ.2018.16.11.1263","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ulutaş Ayşegül, and Kanak Mehmet (2018) Effect of the cooperative learning with family involvement based science education on the scientific process skills of 5-6-year-old children.

A total of 29 couples of mothers and their children were assigned to an experimental group (n = 16 couples) and a control group (n = 13 couples). Mothers in the experimental group participated in 12 weekly sessions and were trained how to enrich their daily parent-child interactions as such. Children’s cognitive performance was assessed by three subscales of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). The results of the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated a significant difference between the experimental and control group. The findings support the effectiveness of the parent training program for enhancing cognitive performance in preschoolers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vahidi Elahe ; Aminyazdi Amir ; Kareshki Hossein ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.5964/ejop.v13i3.1381","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vahidi Elahe, Aminyazdi Amir, and Kareshki Hossein (2017) The effectiveness of a parent-training program for promoting cognitive performance in preschool children.

paper reports the results of an intensive home-based educational intervention programme for 4- to 6-year-old children at risk of educational failure. The programme, Opstap Opnieuw (“Step-up Anew”), was developed in the Netherlands as an alternative to the well-known HIPPY-programme, of which a Dutch version was carried out in the early 1990s for ethnic minority groups, without apparent success. Building on the basic intervention strategy of HIPPY (i.e., involving mothers and paraprofessional aides), a new curriculum was developed based on recent theoretical insights in cognitive and language development, and emergent literacy and numeracy. The programme was carried out with Turkish and Moroccan immigrant families. For the Turkish group, the results were partly positive: There were modest effects of the programme on cognitive development and emergent numeracy, small effects on Turkish language development, but no effects on Dutch language development. In contrast, for the Moroccan group the effects were disappointing. The results are evaluated with respect to recent insights into effective strategies and essential ingredients of early educational intervention programmes.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 2 populations: Turkish and Moroccan.

The curriculum covered two years\r(effectively, 30 weeks in each year) and was presented to the\rmothers on weekly instructions and worksheets, which\rspecified activities for five days each week. In total, there\rwere 150 planned activities per year. Carrying out the daily\ractivities was estimated to take about 20 minutes each day. In addition to the worksheets, the programme provided all kinds of materials to be used in the activities, such as pencils,\rscissors, audiotapes with nursery rhymes and songs, and\rpicture books. Instructions to the mothers about how to carry\rout the activities were written on instruction sheets in clear,\rsimple language and, in view of the low literacy skills of many\rof the target mothers, supported by pictorial illustrations. For\rfully illiterate mothers, stories and songs were also made\ravailable on audiotape. Worksheets, instruction sheets,\rmaterials, books, and tapes were all attractively designed.\rPicture books were written by well-known authors of\rchildren’s books.\r\rThe mothers were supported by paraprofessional aides who\rwere to explain the worksheets and demonstrate appropriate\rinteractional behaviour. These paraprofessionals were experienced mothers themselves, belonged to the same communities as the target families, lived mostly in the same\rneighbourhoods, spoke their languages, but were on average\rslightly better educated. Paraprofessional aides were recruited\rlocally by the coordinators, from the Moroccan target group. They were usually known by the coordinators because of their active participation in the neighbourhood. They received an introductory training (8–10 days) and were further trained on the job by their local coordinator. According to the plan, the paraprofessionals visited the families every two weeks (planned number of visits: 15 in each year) or, alternatively, organised small group meetings in a nearby neighbourhood centre. In addition to instructing and supporting the mothers, the paraprofessionals were also asked to keep records of the actual implementation of the programme activities, thus being an essential instrument of the programme’s implementation strategy and implementation monitoring system.\r\rIn addition to the support by paraprofessionals, the programme also organised monthly group meetings (planned\rnumber of meetings: 12 per year) for the mothers in a\rneighbourhood centre, headed by the local coordinator. A\rportion of the group meetings was used for providing\radditional information on the worksheets. There was also time\rfor discussing general child-rearing themes brought in by the\rparents. However, the main purpose of the group meetings was to provide information about general principles of authoritative and emotionally supportive, sensitive-responsive interaction styles. A videotape showing a model mother-child interaction was used for demonstrating these principles.\rIn view of the fact that the target groups spoke different\rlanguages, the programme was made available in Dutch,\rTurkish, and standard Arabic.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215360,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215434,"AdditionalText":"age of onset (4–5 years)","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"page 150: \rimprove school achievement in reading, writing, and math, and to reduce grade retention and referrals to special education.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215493,"AdditionalText":"interuniversity team of experts","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215557,"AdditionalText":"intermediaries (called paraprofessionals) recruited from the\rparents’ own community to instruct and support the parents,\rand provided group meetings.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215558,"AdditionalText":"parents as instructors of their children","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"Please code for the Moroccan population only.

paper reports the results of an intensive home-based educational intervention programme for 4- to 6-year-old children at risk of educational failure. The programme, Opstap Opnieuw (“Step-up Anew”), was developed in the Netherlands as an alternative to the well-known HIPPY-programme, of which a Dutch version was carried out in the early 1990s for ethnic minority groups, without apparent success. Building on the basic intervention strategy of HIPPY (i.e., involving mothers and paraprofessional aides), a new curriculum was developed based on recent theoretical insights in cognitive and language development, and emergent literacy and numeracy. The programme was carried out with Turkish and Moroccan immigrant families. For the Turkish group, the results were partly positive: There were modest effects of the programme on cognitive development and emergent numeracy, small effects on Turkish language development, but no effects on Dutch language development. In contrast, for the Moroccan group the effects were disappointing. The results are evaluated with respect to recent insights into effective strategies and essential ingredients of early educational intervention programmes.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 2 populations: Turkish and Moroccan.

Parents were also asked to list\nthe strategies they learned from the curriculum, any changes they would like to see in the\ncurriculum. Additionally, they were asked if they would recommend this curriculum to\nother parents. The questionnaire for the control group consisted of 14 items that asked\nsimilar questions; however, instead of asking about the curriculum, questions asked\nabout the project.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215572,"AdditionalText":"Parent Satisfaction Questionnaire","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215502,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 55:\n[¬s]\"During the course of the intervention, parents were asked to\nread to their child 4 times per week for a minimum of 15 minutes for each SBR session.\nThe explicit scripted prompts and questions for each SBR session were designed to help\nparent engage in conversations with their children around words before, during and after\nreading using both fiction and non-fiction books that cover science and social studies\nconcepts.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215518,"AdditionalText":"4","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 55:\n[¬s]\"In\ntotal there were 46 scripted SBR sessions (12 week x 4 SBR sessions per week)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215517,"AdditionalText":"12","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 55:\n[¬s]\"Due to the discontinuation of three books, the\ncurriculum was shortened to 12 weeks for this pilot study[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215519,"AdditionalText":"15","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 55:\n[¬s]\"parents were asked to\nread to their child 4 times per week for a minimum of 15 minutes for each SBR session[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215508,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 55:\n[¬s]\"During the course of the intervention, parents were asked to\nread to their child 4 times per week for a minimum of 15 minutes for each SBR session.\nThe explicit scripted prompts and questions for each SBR session were designed to help\nparent engage in conversations with their children around words before, during and after\nreading using both fiction and non-fiction books that cover science and social studies\nconcepts.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215522,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 92:\n[¬s]\"Two treatment fidelity methods were used in this study to examine parents’\nadherence to the use of the shared-book reading curriculum. Parents were asked to\ncomplete a simple 4-item checklist for each shared-book reading session, for a total of\n46 checklists. The first item required parents to report the duration of their shared-book\nreading session. The other three items asked them to check “yes” or “no” if they engaged\non the required activity: a) discussion before the reading, b) discussing during the\nreading and c) discussion after the reading. In total, the group returned 276 checklist, a\nreturn rate of 60%. On average, parents reported that their shared-book reading session\nlasted 15 minutes. For the checklist returned, parents reported having completed\ndiscussions before, during and after the reading session (100%). One parent participant\nfailed to complete the checklist, and thus the information obtained reflects the self-report\nof 9 intervention parents.\"\n\"The second method used to examine treatment implementation fidelity was\nthrough an evaluation of parent-child shared-book reading audio recordings. Parents\nwere instructed to record two reading sessions one for the first week of treatment and\none, each, for the duration of the intervention for a total of 13. In total, the group\ncompleted 117 audio recordings, a completed rate of 90%. Table 8 summarizes fidelity\ninformation for each participant and for the group. As can be seen in Table 8, only 5\nparticipants completed all the required audio recordings. Contrary to parent report on the\nchecklist about amount of time spent reading, when audio recordings were reviewed,\nfindings indicated that only for 4 parents were reading the minimum suggested time (15[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 93:\n[¬s]\"minutes). The other 6 parents’ average reading time ranged from 10 to 14 minutes. As a\ngroup, on average, shared book reading sessions lasted M =14 minutes. Regarding\nadherence to the curriculum, audio recordings were examined for parents’ use of the\nscripted curriculum prompts and questions at the beginning, during and after the reading.\nAdherence percentages were calculated for each audio-recording session on the different\nsections (discussion before, during, after) and averaged for a total performance score.\nAs a group, on average, parents used the scripted prompts and questions before, during\nand after the reading 67% of the time. However, variability of performance was\nobserved. Five parents demonstrated high adherence to the shared-book reading\ncurriculum and obtained an average total performance of 84% and higher.\"\n\"Two parents\nadhered to some portions of the curriculum and obtained an average total performance of\n62% and 78%, respectively. Three parents obtained low average performance (29% and\nbelow). These three parents failed to use the scripted discussion questions during and\nafter the reading. Although there was variability on the fidelity of intervention (e.g.\nusing the scripted questions during their shared-book reading session), it was noted that\nin general, parents engaged in discussion about targeted and non-targeted words. It is\npossible that the “Stop” stickers placed at the bottom of the targeted pages of each book,\nprompted parents to discuss the targeted words. In summary, the results of the fidelity of\nimplementation analysis suggests that all child intervention participants were exposed to\nthe books and portions of the curriculum, but only half of these participants received the\nintervention as it was intended.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215529,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215533,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 58:\n[¬s]\"Parents completed questionnaires while the\nprincipal investigator assessed children.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Vaquero_2014.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215537,"AdditionalText":"ROWPVT-SBE (Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test: Spanish-Bilingual Edition) and EOWPVT-SBE (Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test: Spanish-Bilingual Edition)","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":879235,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 59:\n[¬s]\"ROWPVT-SBE (Receptive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test: Spanish-\nBilingual Edition; Brownell, 2001).

Twenty Spanish-speaking mother-child dyads were assigned to one of two conditions (shared-book reading curriculum, or control condition). Child participants were tested at three points in time on general Spanish receptive and expressive vocabulary, knowledge of targeted words taught by the shared-book reading curriculum, knowledge of concepts about print (CAP) and oral narrative abilities (microstructure and macrostructure elements). Based on prior research, it was predicted that children in the intervention group would outperform their peers in the control group on all outcome variables at post-testing and at the 12-month follow-up. Results at post-testing revealed positive effects of the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum on measures of generalized receptive vocabulary, targeted receptive vocabulary, CAP, microstructural oral narrative skills (lengthier mean length utterances; MLU) for the story retell task and macrostructural oral narrative skills (story grammar) for the two oral narrative tasks (story retell and story spontaneous). Results at the 12- month follow-up revealed a positive impact of the intervention for the story retell task. Although we were unable to detect long-term sustained effects of the intervention on all child outcome variables, the pilot study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that teaching Low-SES Spanish-speaking parents how to use a scripted shared-book reading curriculum that incorporates cognitively complex questions about words and stories before, during and after reading, can produce positive impacts on children’s oral language, CAP and narrative skills at short-term. Implications, limitations and directions for future research are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Vaquero Juana ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Social sciences\nEducation\nEmergent literacy\nLatino children\nShared-book reading\nVocabulary\nEarly childhood education\nLiteracy\nReading instruction\nLatin American Studies\nIndividual & family studies\n0628:Individual & family studies\n0535:Reading instruction\n0550:Latin American Studies\n0535:Literacy\n0518:Early childhood education","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vaquero Juana (2014) An exploratory study of a shared-book reading intervention involving Spanish-speaking Latino families. , Texas A&M University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":11237553,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416187,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Mother-AslTeacher Program[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Waksman_1980.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416187,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"The present study was undertaken to examine the possibility of enhancing\nmaternal teaching strategies and whether this in turn could bring about a\nchange in a child's learning patterns and subsequent school performance.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Waksman_1980.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215251,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416187,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Subjects were matched as to their age, sex, and number of\nsiblings and then assigned to either the experimental or control group by\nrandom selection.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Waksman_1980.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215255,"AdditionalText":"The intervention was given to Mothers at their home and they were asked to complete the set task with their child the next week, also at home","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215298,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":416187,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Each week a trained paraprofessional visited the home of each experimental-\ngroup mother and presented a task to her.

What else? -- this section suggested to the mother a variety of ways in which\nshe could add to and enhance the learning of a specific task. It allowed both the\nmother and the child to explore the many ways and situations in which newly-\nlearned tasks or skills could be applied.\nSome of the teaching ideas that were incorporated into the weekly tasks\nwere: development of concepts such as time and size; recognition of colors and\nshapes; familiarity with letters and number symbols, etc.\nThe presentation of the task was followed by a role-playing session in\nwhich the paraprofessional assumed the role of the child, the mother the role of\nteacher. The mother then had a chance to practise what she had just been\ntaught. This was followed by a general discussion of the previous week's task,\nthe general objectives of the program, and other related matters. An appoint-\nment was then made for the next visit and the mother was reminded to teach the\nnew task to her child during the following week, and if possible to repeat it more\nthan once.

The teaching staff varied in their\nlevel of formal training, from high school\ngraduates to master teachers.

First was a prob-\nlem-solving approach that called for the home\nvisitor to encourage and promote parent prob-\nlem solving throughout all her interactions\nwith the parent and to help parents learn\nspecific problem-solving strategies (Wasik,\n1984; Wasik, Bryant, & Lyons, 1990). This\ncomponent was included based on the\nrationale that problem-solving ability is nec-\nessary for effective parenting as well as for\nmanaging everyday problems, and that this\nability could be enhanced by specific train-\ning.\nphasized activities that support both the in-\ntellectual/creative domain and the social/\nemotional domain of the child. Language\nstimulation received special attention and\nfocused on promoting verbal interaction mod-\neled on what a nurturant and developmen-\ntally encouraging mother might establish with\nher child (see McGinness & Ramey, 1981, for\na more detailed description). To foster certain\ntypes of linguistic functioning in the child's\nrepertoire, teachers provided a large number\nof opportunities for communication and for\nsocial, representational, syntactic, and seman-\ntic competence. In addition to the educational\nday-care experience, the children and parents\nin the Child Development Center Plus Fam-\nily Education group also received the family\neducation intervention described below.\nFamily education.-The Family Educa-\ntion program was designed to help the parent\nHome visitors discussed with parents on-\ngoing concerns or goals and ways they could\nuse problem-solving strategies to deal with\nthese situations. Concerns could be brought\nup for discussion either by the home visitor or\nfoster the cognitive and social development of\nthe child. The home-based intervention was\nbased on a belief that not only do many\nfamilies lack knowledge and skills necessary\nto positively influence their child's develop-\nment, but many families also experience\nstresses that interfere with effective par-\nenting. To respond to family needs, home\nvisitors were to establish a caring relationship\nwith the parents. Through this relationship\nthey could provide support and encourage-\nment, convey information, be an advocate,\npromote effective coping, and encourage\nand model positive parent-child interactions.\nHome visitors also facilitated the family's con-\ntact with agencies in the community, such as\nhelping parents sign up for the WIC program\nor referring them to local support services for\nby the parent and could be child-related or\nadult-related. The home visitor used these on-\ngoing concerns to discuss effective problem\nsolving and to discuss the stages in the prob-\nlem solving model: problem identification,\ngoal selection, generating alternatives, select-\ning consequences, making decisions, evaluat-\ning problems, implementation, and evalua-\ntion. These steps were presented to the\nparents in everyday language (i.e., \"It is im-\nportant to stop and think before you act\"). The\nhome visitor used both real and hypothetical\nproblems to illustrate the different problem-\nsolving stages. She also encouraged the par-\nent to think through her concerns, to generate\nalternatives, and to make decisions. Topics\nranged from arranging for baby-sitters and\nfeeding problems to returning to school or\nfinding ajob. Printed materials illustrating the\nstages in the problem-solving model were\ngiven to the parent.\nWithin the home visit, the basic child\ncurriculum component was Learningames,\nthe same materials used in the day-care.\nHome visitors demonstrated and described\nthe developmentally appropriate activities\nand helped the family identify materials in\nthe home needed for the activities.

For the most intensive intervention group, family education was combined with a center-based educational day-care program; the less intensive intervention group received the home-based family education program only. To assess the cognitive performance of children, The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered at 6, 12, and 18 months; the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test at 24, 36, and 48 months; and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities at 30,42, and 54 months. On each test after the 6-month assessment, scores of children in the educational day-care plus family support group were greater than those in the other 2 groups. No cognitive intervention effects were obtained for the family education group. Group effects were not obtained for measures of either the quality of the home environment or parent attention.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: (1) Child Development Center Plus Family Education, (2) Family Education, (3) a Control group.

To what extent does a Head Start experience accelerate the rate at which disadvantaged preschoolers acquire cognitive skills? (2) Are the Planned Variation models, simply by virtue of sponsorship more effective than ordinary nonsponsored Head Start programs? and (3) Are some Planned Variation models particularly effective at imparting certain skills? The first chapter gives an overall picture of the Head Start Planned Variation study, while the second chapter summarizes data concerning background characteristics and distribution of test scores. Chapter 3 provides a general discussion of methodological issues and some of the major difficulties resulting from the study design. Chapters 4-7 attempt to present a picture of the pattern of overall effects of various programs through ranking analysis, residual analysis, analysis of covariance, and resistant analysis. The final chapters explore the question of whether the relative effectiveness of various programs is related to certain child background characteristics, such as sex, ethnicity, age, prior school experience, and mother's education. One major conclusion drawn as a result of the intermodel comparisons was that Head Start programs are quite homogeneous in their ability to promote general cognitive development.","Comments":"MDE: This report includes 11 programs that follow the Head Start.

The sound foundations\ncurriculum began in February in each classroom and continued\nthrough June. Teachers introduced children to seven consonant\nsounds (s, m, p, g, I, t, sh) in the beginning and ending positions in\nwords and to two vowel sounds (a and e) in the beginning position\nonly.\"\n\"As an example of how this element of the curriculum\nworked, on Monday of beginning /s/ week, children were invited\nindividually to walk forward from the group and to find objects\nwith names beginning with the /s/ sound (e.g., seal or scissors) in\na large colorful poster. On Wednesday, the students were asked to\nfind objects on their own worksheets that began with the /s/ sound\nand to color the objects with crayons. On Friday, the students were\nasked to play a version of the game hot potato in which the\nchildren sat in a circle and passed a bean bag to each other while\nmusic was playing.

of 4-year-olds attending Head Start were randomly assigned to an intervention condition, involving an add-on emergent literacy curriculum, or a control condition, involving the regular Head Start curriculum. Children in the intervention condition experienced interactive book reading at home and in the classroom as well as a classroom-based sound and letter awareness program. Children were pretested and posttested on standardized tests of language, writing, linguistic awareness, and print concepts. Effects of the intervention were significant across all children in the domains of writing and print concepts. Effects on language were large but only for those children whose primary caregivers had been actively involved in the at-home component of the program. One linguistic awareness subtest, involving the ability to identify the first letter and first sound of words, showed significant effects.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 June 2018","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Epstein J N; Angell A L; Payne A C; Crone D A; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.86.4.542","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Epstein J N, Angell A L, Payne A C, Crone D A, and Fischel J E (1994) Outcomes of an emergent literacy intervention in Head Start.

effects of an interactive book reading program were assessed with children from low-income families who attended subsidized day-care centers in New York. The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 months behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (b) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (c) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests. These assessments were repeated at a 6-month follow-up. Educationally and statistically significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and follow-up on measures of expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: 1) school plus home condition, 2) school only, and 3) control.

Positive effects at the end of Head Start obtained in the original study were replicated, and effects on emergent literacy skills in both cohorts were maintained through the end of kindergarten. Effects of the emergent literacy intervention did not generalize to literacy outcomes at the end of 1st and 2nd grades. Growth in emergent literacy skills and literacy skills from year to year was strongly influenced by variation in the Head Start centers and school districts attended by children in the sample. Although children in the sample began formal reading instruction with relatively low levels of emergent literacy skills, they showed substantial gains with respect to national norms by the end of 2nd grade.","Comments":"Export Date: 13 June 2018","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Crone D A; Zevenbergen A A; Schultz M D; Velting O N; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.261","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Crone D A, Zevenbergen A A, Schultz M D, Velting O N, and Fischel J E (1999) Outcomes of an emergent literacy intervention from Head Start through second grade.

of parental participation in school on the assistance parents could give their children outside of the classroom. A Parent Involvement Program was developed in the Mesa, Arizona Title I schools to help raise the consistently low reading readiness scores of the kindergarteners in these schools. A random proportional stratified sample was selected from 14 kindergarten classrooms in five of these schools: 40 students whose parents did not participate in the program and 40 students whose parents did participate. Parents received instruction twice a week in working effectively with their children,making reading games; and teaching in the kindergarten classroom one day a week. The Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on letter names was administered as a pre- and post-test (the Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on phonemes was also administered as a post-test).. Results showed that all children who were taught by the parents mastered the beginning skill of letter recognition, regardless-of-whether their- own parents-attended theParent Involvement Program. However, in the more difficult task of learning phonemes, the children whose own parents attended the program, learned more letter sounds than children whose own parents did not attend.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Woods C ; Barnard D P; Teselle E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Woods C, Barnard D P, and Teselle E (1974) The effect of parental involvement programs on reading readiness scores.

impact of a shared-reading program on the narrative skills of children from low-income families was examined. Participants in the study were 4-year-old children (N=123) enrolled in Head Start. Fifty-eight percent of the sample participated in a 30-week shared-reading intervention conducted in Head Start classrooms and homes. The remainder of the sample experienced the regular Head Start curriculum. The shared-reading intervention was found to have a significant effect on children's inclusion of evaluative devices in their narratives. Specifically, children who participated in the intervention program were significantly more likely to include references to internal states of characters and dialogue in their narratives at the end of the Head Start year than children who did not participate in the intervention program. This study adds to the growing experimental literature demonstrating that preschool literacy interventions can have a positive impact on the language skills of children from low-income families.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zevenbergen Andrea A; Whitehurst Grover J; Zevenbergen Jason A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0193-3973(03)00021-2","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zevenbergen Andrea A, Whitehurst Grover J, and Zevenbergen Jason A (2003) Effects of a shared-reading intervention on the inclusion of evaluative devices in narratives of children from low-income families.

study is a replication and extension of an earlier study, using a larger sample, a better measure of poverty status, and new longitudinal data. The study used path analysis to test hypothesized models of how the Parents as Teachers (PAT) program affects children’s school readiness and subsequent third-grade achievement. Participants were 5,721 kindergarten children who were chosen to be representative of all children beginning public school in the state of Missouri in the fall of 1998–2000. These children were subsequently located in the state’s third-grade test database 4–5 years later (82% of the original kindergarten sample). The causal models, which postulated both direct and indirect effects of PAT, were strongly supported by the data. Editors’ Strategic Implications: The findings add to the evidence that the PAT home visiting program holds promise as a primary prevention program. The authors demonstrate how parenting practices (including reading to children and enrolling them in preschool) promote both school readiness and subsequent academic achievement, but they also remind us of the pervasive effects of poverty.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use Table 7. Third grade achievement (statewise exams Communication Arts -MAP) Compare PAT+pre-school vs No PAT pre-school; then PAT no preschool vs No PAT no preschool (for Poverty) and the respective 2 comparisons for Non-Poverty. After you have produced 1 effect size for each of these 4 comparisons (therefore, 4 ES), take the fixed effects using the fixed-effect excel formula, to produce a Toolkit primary outcome ","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zigler Edward ; Pfannenstiel Judy C; Seitz Victoria ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/S10935-008-0132-1","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zigler Edward, Pfannenstiel Judy C, and Seitz Victoria (2008) The parents as teachers program and school success: A replication and extension.

supplemental Teaching Together intervention was iteratively developed using multiple earlier phases to ensure the\ncurriculum was feasible and appealing for users. Thus, this pilot\nstudy used an underpowered, randomized controlled trialto evaluate intervention promise for child outcomes. We screened children\nto focus only on a sample of children eligible for Tier 2 based on\nstate screening measures. Although in authentic MTSS models children who receive Tier 1 versus Tier 2 represent different skill levels,\nwe sought to experimentally contrast the effects of enriched Tier 1\nonly or added Tier 2 supports for a sample of preschoolers at higher\nrisk due to Tier 2 eligibility. We designed the study to examine\nthe effects of increasingly intensive teacher and parent supports\nsuch that children could be randomly assigned to Tier 1 Only or\nincreasingly intensive interventions including Tier 2 Basic or Tier\n2 Enhanced family supports. The components of the three school\nplus home interventions are detailed below; all treatment conditions included an aligned parent component rather than a school\nonly condition.\nOur primary research question asked:What are the effects of the\nincreasingly tailored tiers of school plus home interventions (Tier\n1 Only, Tier 2 Basic, Tier 2 Enhanced) contrasted with business as-usual (BAU) practice on children’s language skills and literacy\nskills? Second, we asked for which children the interventions were\nmore or less beneficial depending on children’s: (a) DLL status; (b)\ninitial skill levels; and (c) end of year skill level, examining varying\npoints of the conditional distribution of the outcome. We hypothesized that the intervention program would result in improved\noutcomes relative to the other children receiving business-as usual instruction. We also expected that each increasing tier and\nintensity of school and home supports would be associated with\nmodest gains relative to BAU practice. We did not have directional expectations around the second research question but felt\nsuchconsiderations were importantinexploring whomight benefit\nfrom this new program. _MR","Comments":"MDE: Please code for Tier 1 vs business as usual (BAU) as control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zucker Tricia A; Cabell Sonia Q; Petscher Yaacov ; Mui Heather ; Landry Susan H; Tock Jamie ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2020.09.001","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zucker Tricia A, Cabell Sonia Q, Petscher Yaacov, Mui Heather, Landry Susan H, and Tock Jamie (2021) Teaching Together: Pilot study of a tiered language and literacy intervention with Head Start teachers and linguistically diverse families.

supplemental Teaching Together intervention was iteratively developed using multiple earlier phases to ensure the\ncurriculum was feasible and appealing for users. Thus, this pilot\nstudy used an underpowered, randomized controlled trialto evaluate intervention promise for child outcomes. We screened children\nto focus only on a sample of children eligible for Tier 2 based on\nstate screening measures. Although in authentic MTSS models children who receive Tier 1 versus Tier 2 represent different skill levels,\nwe sought to experimentally contrast the effects of enriched Tier 1\nonly or added Tier 2 supports for a sample of preschoolers at higher\nrisk due to Tier 2 eligibility. We designed the study to examine\nthe effects of increasingly intensive teacher and parent supports\nsuch that children could be randomly assigned to Tier 1 Only or\nincreasingly intensive interventions including Tier 2 Basic or Tier\n2 Enhanced family supports. The components of the three school\nplus home interventions are detailed below; all treatment conditions included an aligned parent component rather than a school\nonly condition.\nOur primary research question asked:What are the effects of the\nincreasingly tailored tiers of school plus home interventions (Tier\n1 Only, Tier 2 Basic, Tier 2 Enhanced) contrasted with business as-usual (BAU) practice on children’s language skills and literacy\nskills? Second, we asked for which children the interventions were\nmore or less beneficial depending on children’s: (a) DLL status; (b)\ninitial skill levels; and (c) end of year skill level, examining varying\npoints of the conditional distribution of the outcome. We hypothesized that the intervention program would result in improved\noutcomes relative to the other children receiving business-as usual instruction. We also expected that each increasing tier and\nintensity of school and home supports would be associated with\nmodest gains relative to BAU practice. We did not have directional expectations around the second research question but felt\nsuchconsiderations were importantinexploring whomight benefit\nfrom this new program. _MR","Comments":"MDE: Please combine Tier 2 groups vs business as usual control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zucker Tricia A; Cabell Sonia Q; Petscher Yaacov ; Mui Heather ; Landry Susan H; Tock Jamie ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2020.09.001","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zucker Tricia A, Cabell Sonia Q, Petscher Yaacov, Mui Heather, Landry Susan H, and Tock Jamie (2021) Teaching Together: Pilot study of a tiered language and literacy intervention with Head Start teachers and linguistically diverse families.
