determine if direct parental training would effect third, fourth, and fifth grade students' academic performance in the area of mathematics. Mathematics is an important subject in elementary education. The major emphasis of the activities involved was on reinforcing computational skills. Those interested in the formal education of students, both in the K-12 arena and also teacher education programs at universities should find the analysis of the effects of parent-school involvement an important area of study. Parents who volunteered for the study were randomly assigned to one of three study groups. Treatment Group A consisted of direct parental training in the area of mathematical activities concentrating on computational skills which were played at home with their children. Treatment Group B only received the mathematical activities which were played at home with their children. Group C was the Control Group. Based upon this research, parental involvement does not make a difference with third and fifth grade students' mathematical achievement test scores. There was however, significance with the fourth grade students' mathematical achievement test scores. Further analysis revealed that at the third grade, those students who returned log books scored significantly higher on the mathematic achievement test scores than those students who did not return the log books. There was no significance found for the fourth and fifth grades with respect to the log books. Additionally, at the third grade, females played more of the mathematical activities than did the males. At the fourth grade, the males played more of the mathematical activities than the females, at the fifth grade, the males played approximately twice as many mathematical activities as the females. There was no significance found at the third and fourth grades with respect to gender, however, significance was found at the fifth grade.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

determine if the math and reading scores achieved by first grade students on the Georgia Criterion Reference Test (GCRT) could be increased by parent-aided homework designed to give daily practice on the math and reading tested objectives. The subjects were 77 first grade children enrolled in an urban elementary school in the South and their parents. The school system placed children in one of four first grade classrooms in the fall, 1987, based on their achievement scores in reading and math. Mean class achievement scores and teacher experiences were used to designate two classes as experimental and two as comparison. Parents of children in the experimental classes received a group meeting at the beginning of the year, another meeting in the middle of the year, and daily parent-aided homework assignments listing the objective and learning activity from October, 1987 to April, 1988. The comparison parents received two group meetings, with different content, and no systematic parent-aided homework. Analysis of Covariance and Sheffe's procedure failed to reject null hypotheses 1 and 2 indicating that no significant differences existed in achievement scores received in reading and math on the GCRT between students who had received the parent/homework intervention program and those who had not. Computation of Pearson's r yielded moderate positive correlations allowing the rejection of null hypotheses 3 and 4, thus, revealing a positive correlation did exist between the number of reading and math parent/homework intervention assignments completed and GCRT reading and math achievement scores. The moderate positive correlations found between achievement scores and amount of homework completed along with the positive responses from parents and students indicated that homework can be effectively used with primary age children when parent participation is included in the homework process. The study demonstrated that (1) homework will be completed by primary age students if it is well-organized and easy to locate; (2) completion of parent-aided homework is moderately related to academic achievement; and (3) the parent/homework intervention program improved parent's understanding of their child's educational strengths and weaknesses, relations with the school, and the overall climate of parent-teacher relations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Austin C A;

studies were carried out to investigate the impact of participation in the Home Instruction Programme for Preschool and Year One Youngsters (HIPPY) on New Zealand children's reading ability, school readiness and school behaviour. In study 1, scores on a Reading Diagnostic Survey were obtained for 77 six?year?old HIPPY children and 704 six?year?old non?HIPPY children. In study 2, 29 HIPPY children who had recently entered school and 29 control children were assessed using four subsections of the Metropolitan Readiness tests. In the third study the Behavioural Academic Self Esteem Scale (BASE) was completed by teachers for the HIPPY and control children in study 2 as well as all their classmates. HIPPY children were found to show consistently better performance on all of the measures used and the differences reached statistical significance on three of the six sub?tests of the Reading Diagnostic Survey and the BASE scale.","Comments":"MDE: Please code study 1.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barhava‐Mònteith Galia ; Harré Niki ; Field Jeff ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0300443991590112","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barhava‐Mònteith Galia, Harré Niki, and Field Jeff (1999) A Promising Start: An Evaluation of the HIPPY Program in New Zealand.

The printed version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Parent (DISC-P) version 2.1 that was constructed and used in the DSM-IV ?eld trials for the Disruptive Behavior Disorders (Lahey et al., 1994) was employed in this study. This particular interview was designed to collect information on both DSM-III-R and DSM- IV symptom lists for 12 childhood disorders. Since the ?nal DSM-IV symptom lists for each disorder are now published, the present project employed those criteria in the scoring of the results of this interview rather than using the older DSM-III-R criteria. The interview also required that both the parent and interviewer provide separate estimates of the child’s global assessment of functioning scale using a range of 0 to 100 with lower scores re?ecting poorer global functioning.\"\n\"Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edel- brock, 1983). This scale provides T-scores for seven diﬀerent dimensions of child psychopathology and has been used extensively in child mental health research. The revised 1991 scoring sytem was employed in this study. The Sex Problems, Somatic Complaints, and Thought Problems scales were not used given that these domains offunctioning were not a focus of this intervention program and that there is no equivalent Sex Problems scale on the teacher version of the CBCL also used in this project (see below). The scales used were those for Withdrawal, AnxietyDepression, Social Problems, Attention Problems, Aggression, and Delinquent Behavior.\"\n\"Home Situations Questionnaire (HSQ; Barkley, 1990). This scale assesses the pervasiveness of behavior problems across 16 diﬀerent home and public setttings (Number of Problem Settings) and the severity of these behavior problems (Mean Severity Score) as rated on a Likert scale of 1 to 9. These two raw scores were used in this study.\"\n\"Normative Adaptive Behavior Checklist (Adams, 1984). This 120-item questionnaire surveys parents about a child’s adaptive functioning in eight areas of development, including ﬁne motor, gross motor, language, and self-help skills, in- dependence, home responsibilities, etc. The total adaptive behavior score (standard score) was used here.\"\n\"Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI; Abidin, 1986). This is a shortened version of the original PSI and is completed by parents. It evaluates the degree of perceived stress in the role of being a parent to this particular child. Only the Total Stress raw score was used here.\"\n\"Parenting Sense ofCompetence Scale (Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman, 1978; Mash & Johnston, 1983). This self-report scale was employed to evaluate a parent’s degree of self- perceived competence or eﬃcacy (nine items) and satisfaction (seven items) in their role as a parent. It produces separate raw scores for each of these two domains.\"\n\"CBCL-Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1986): This scale contains 126 items related to children’s behavioral and emotional problems. It yields eight T- scores identical to those for the parent version noted above with the exception that no Sex Problems scale is generated. Again, the 1991 scoring system was employed for this study. The scales used were for Withdrawal, AnxietyDepression, Social Prob- lems, Attention Problems, Aggression, and Delinquent Be- havior. The Somatic Complaints and Thought Problems scales were not employed here given that these domains offunctioning were not speciﬁcally targeted within the intervention programs.\"\n\"School Situations Questionnaire (SSQ; Barkley, 1990). This rating scale provided a measure of the pervasiveness of a child’s behavior problems across 12 diﬀerent school situations (Number ofProblems Settings). Each problem setting was rated as to severity using a Likert scale (1–9) so as to provide a Mean Severity Score across all problem settings. Raw scores were used here.\"\n\"Self-Control Rating Scale (Kendall & Wilcox, 1979). This is a 33-item scale used to assess children’s self-control. A single summary raw score was generated for this behavioral di- mension.\"\n\"Social Skills Rating Scale (SSRS; Gresham & Elliott, 1990). This standardized and normed teacher-completed scale was used to assess the social skills (30 items), behavioral problems (18 items), and academic competence (9 items) of the children. Three standard scores were obtained from this scale, one for each domain.\"\n\"Woodcock Johnson Psychoeducational Test Battery (Woodcock&Johnson, 1984). This lengthy test battery includes a number of tests assessing cognitive abilities (intelligence) as well as a separate battery of tests assessing academic knowledge (science, social studies, humanities) and skills (reading, math, spelling). Standard scores are produced for each subtest. Only the academic knowledge and skills tests were used in assessing treatment eﬀects.\"\n\"Continuous Performance Test (CPT; Gordon, 1983). The preschool version was used here, which provided raw scores for total correct and number of commission errors. The task uses a single digit target (‘‘1’’) that appears in a random series ofdigits presented at the rate of one per second on the display screen of a small computerized device. The task lasts 6 minutes. Due to the young age of the subjects and consistent with recom- mendations of the test developer, the examiner remained in the room during the testing.\"\n\"Disruptive behavior during the CPT. During the child’s performance of the CPT, the child’s behavior was videotaped from behind a one-way mirror. These videotapes were later coded for four categories of behavior related to ADHD using the Restricted Academic Situations Coding System developed by Barkley (1990). These categories were: oﬀ-task, ﬁdgets, vocalizes, and out-of-seat. Deﬁnitions of the codes and inform- ation on the reliability and validity of the system can be found\"\n\"Parenting Practices Scale (Strayhorn & Weidman, 1988).\"\n\"This is a 34-item scale used to assess the extent to which parents\nuse various practices commonly taught in most behavioral\nparent training programs.

A second\ncoder independently recoded 20% of the videotapes so as to\nprovide an estimate of inter-coder reliability for this measure.\nAgreement between these two coders for these observations was\ncomputed using Pearson product-moment correlations for the\nscores of percentage occurrence for each behavioral category.\nThe inter-coder agreements across the three cohorts for each\ncategory were: o?-taskl.97, ?dgetsl.93, vocalizesl.95,\nand out-of-seatl.97.\"\n\"Classroom behavioral observations. To record the behavior of\nchildren in their classrooms, this study employed the CBCL-\nDirect Observation Form (DOF; Achenbach, 1986). This\ncoding system is designed to assess the same behavioral items\nthat are found on the parent and teacher versions of the CBCL\ndescribed earlier. The observer visited the child’s classroom and\nobserved the child for 1 hour, after which the rating scale was\ncompleted by the observer. The total raw scores for the\nexternalizing and internalizing items were scored separately and\nreported here. For 20% of the subjects, a second observer\naccompanied the ﬁrst to the same classroom and observed the\nchild for the same 1-hour interval, after which they completed\nthis observation form. The two coders in this case sat at\ndiﬀerent locations in the classroom so as to avoid observing the\nother’s completion of this observation form. Inter-coder re-\nliability was calculated using a Pearson product-moment corre-\nlation separately for the externalizing, internalizing, and total\nraw scores with the following results : internalizing symptoms,\n.69, externalizing symptoms, .80, and total symptoms, .75.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Barkley etal_2000.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215538,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414575,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Mental health history.

Typically, this procedure\ninvolves placing the child in a clinic playroom with adjacent\nobservation room and shared one-way mirror and having the\nchild sit alone and perform math problems. Because of the\nyoung age ofthe subjects used here, this procedure was modiﬁed\nsuch that the child was required to sort plastic colored chips into\ncontainers by their color (red, blue, white) instead ofperforming\nmath problems. The task lasted 15 minutes. The child was\nvideotaped from behind the one-way mirror during this task.\nThe same four behavior categories used during the CPT were\nscored for their percentage occurrence in order to measure\nADHD symptoms during task performance. Additionally, the\nnumber of chips sorted by the child was also scored. A second\ncoder independently recoded 20% of the videotapes so as to\nprovide an estimate of inter-coder reliability for this measure.\nAgreement was computed using Pearson product-moment cor-\nrelations for the percentage occurrence scores for each behav-\nioral category and the results were: oﬀ-taskl.94, ﬁdgetsl\n.95, vocalizesl.98, and out-of-seatl.98.\"\n\"Mother–childinteractions during free play andtask periods.\nMothers and children were asked to play with each other using\ntoys in a playroom for a 10-minute period.

These 'disruptive' children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year: no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains: parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother-child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children. Even so, most treatment effects were specific to the school environment and did not affect achievement skills. These findings must be viewed as tentative until follow-up evaluations can be done to determine the long-term outcomes of these interventions.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 4 arms.

The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Beach D W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beach D W (2004) The effects of a school district's kindergarten readiness summer program on phonological awareness skills of at-risk prekindergarten students: A regression discontinuity analysis. , Utah State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407113,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407109,"AdditionalText":"78","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407108,"AdditionalText":"84","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407118,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406862,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406864,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406866,"AdditionalText":"general demographic info","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":424133,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"Of these, 125 were in bilingual programs. 17 were in\nregular education (all English programs). and 20 were in English as a second\nhmguage classes.

A parental assistance plan (PAP) was devised to involve parents in working on language with their children at home 20 minutes a day & brought the parents into school a few hours per week for 12 weeks. The mothers of 2 groups followed the PAP (1 group also received the Distar language program), 1 group received only the Distar, & 1 group received no formal intervention but merely played with toys in the presence of a teacher for an equivalent period. Results of an immediate EPVT posttest & another one 18 months later showed that the groups with the PAP showed significantly greater increase in language development.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Beveridge M ; Jerrams Ann ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8279.1981.tb02484.x","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beveridge M, and Jerrams Ann (1981) Parental Involvement in Language Development: An Evaluation of a School-Based Parental Assistance Plan.

of teaching Spanish-speaking Even Start mothers to use dialogic reading strategies with their preschool children were examined in this experimental study. Thirty-four children and their mothers participated. Mothers in the treatment group were taught to use the strategy to engage their children in conversation while reading storybooks. Data gathered from the children at pretest and posttest were measures of receptive vocabulary (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised), expressive vocabulary by calculating mean length of utterance and concepts about print using a checklist. Use of the Adult/Child Interactive Reading Inventory (ACIRI) provided data about mother and child behaviors at pretest and posttest. An attitudinal measure assessed the trained mothers' self-efficacy as a literacy coach. Findings include direct effects on the mothers' ability to use the strategy as well as indirect effects on the children's emergent literacy behaviors. Statistically significant effects were found for concepts about print (p < .05) using an ANOVA. A strong positive correlation (r(12) = .85, p < .001) between the treatment group mother's and child's ACIRI score was found. Time spent in Even Start (p < .02) and the mother's ACIRI score (p < .01) were positively related to the child's mean length of utterance in a multiple linear regression analysis. A moderate positive correlation was found (r(12) = .54, p < .05) for the relation between the mother's ACIRI score and the self-efficacy measure at posttest. Implications include a promising reading strategy resulting in the growth of emergent literacy skills for bilingual children and changed reading behaviors for their mothers in workshop format that could be easily and inexpensively incorporated into existing curriculum in intergenerational literacy programs.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code PPVT-R as primary, Concepts of print and Expressive language as secondary outcomes.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Brickman Sharon Olivia; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education\nReading.\nHispanic American Children Education (Preschool)\nReading (Preschool)\nReading Parent Participation.\nEven Start Program (U.S.)","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Brickman Sharon Olivia (2002) Effects of a joint book reading strategy on Even Start. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407110,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":432659,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 47:\n[¬s]\"A total of 124 LEP students from Tuolumne Elementary\nSchool (grades l through 3) were selected to participate in\nthis study.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Busco_1991_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407105,"AdditionalText":"8 - Control and Intervention were mixed in the same classes.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":432659,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 48:\n[¬s]\"Students whose parents participated were considered the\ntreatment group.

project evaluated in this dissertation was intended to help limited-English-proficient (LEP) Hispanic students achieve competence in their native language of Spanish while engaging in classroom study that used some English. The project was also intended to provide indirect instruction to these students' parents and other family members who could facilitate their educational achievement. Participants were 124 students and their parents from a small California school district with a population that is primarily Spanish speaking. The students were in eight bilingual classes in grades 1 through 3. Only 61 families were actually involved in project activities; the remaining families served as a control group. Teachers encouraged the students to take home literature backpacks, each containing a cassette player, audiotape, and Spanish literature book. They were asked to write their reactions to the audiotapes in a journal. Their parents were asked to share stories of their lives with their children and to initial the pages of the children's journals after reading them. The students' families were visited by two community aides, who encouraged the parents to read Spanish literature books once a night to their children. Parents were also encouraged to listen to the audiotapes from the backpack materials. The aides also verified the parents' participation by making sure they were sharing stories and initialing their children's journals. Academic achievement (using the Spanish Assessment of Basic Education (SABE)) and self-esteem (using the Behavioral Academic Self-Esteem Test (BASE)) were measured before and after 5 months of participation in the project. Treatment students made larger gains on all measures than did control students, but the differences were not statistically significant. Third graders scored significantly higher on the SABE in academic gains than did students in other grade levels. Female students scored significantly higher on the BASE than did males. Although no statistical support was shown for the program as indicated by statistical tests, the study did demonstrate that a parent literacy program can bond parents and children through a literacy environment. This environment is created through the use of techniques and materials that make literacy meaningful and enjoyable for students and their parents.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

innovative integrated remedial reading program has been developed based on recent research findings. My longitudinal studies have revealed that poor reading compounds itself over the years. The majority of children with reading disabilities currently remain in regular classrooms with varying techniques being used depending upon individual school directives and current educational theory. Despite current remedial techniques, the poorer reader tends to remain so throughout the school years. Innovative techniques must be developed in the hope of altering this pattern. This paper presents one alternative strategy which can be used to upgrade reading skills and break the cycle of reading failure. The Reading Assistance Tutorial Pack (R.A.T. Pack) is a carefully sequenced series of activities that enables the learner to experience the motivating and reinforcing properties of success through all stages of phonetic and reading skills development. It is a systematic, multidisciplinary remedial reading program based on sound behavior, psycholinguistic and cognitive theories of learning—incorporating listening, speaking, seeing, writing, thinking, and comprehension skills. The R.A.T. Pack demands a high percentage of on-task behavior and trains phonological processing strategies. Functional language use is promoted through enjoyable activities involving sentence construction, cloze passages, puzzles, games, and other creative manipulations of the surface features of languages. The program has proven successful in schools, homes, and clinics.","Comments":"MDE: This paper includes two experiments.

Hong Kong Chinese kindergarten children were pretested on the Preschool and Primary Chinese Literacy Scale (PPCLS) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test?Third Edition (PPVT-III), and assigned randomly within schools to 1 of 3 conditions, dialogic reading, typical reading and control. After an 8- week intervention, the children were posttested. Results indicated a significant main group effect for performance on both the PPCLS and the PPVT-III, with children in the dialogic reading group benefiting significantly from the intervention. These results indicate that early literacy-related activities in the home have strong and direct effects on both children's literacy growth and language development in Chinese. The success of the dialogic reading technique in this study contributes to the goal of raising global literacy standards and educational achievement.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 3 arms.

Children were pretested on Chinese character recognition, vocabulary, morphological awareness, and reading interest and then assigned randomly to 1 of 4 conditions: the dialogic reading with morphology training (DR + MT), dialogic reading (DR), typical reading, or control condition. After a 12-week intervention period, the DR intervention yielded greater gains in vocabulary, and the DR + MT intervention yielded greater improvement in character recognition and morphological awareness. Both interventions enhanced children's reading interest. Results confirm that different home literacy approaches influence children's oral and written language skills differently: Shared book reading promotes language development, whereas parents' explicit metalinguistic training within a shared book reading context better prepares children for learning to read.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

effectiveness of learning games upon reading achievement and I.Q. of economically disadvantaged children. It was hypothesized that children who played learning games with their parents would achieve significantly greater scores in reading and I.Q. than children denied such gaming experience. Thirty second grade children from the Seattle Central Area served as subjects. There were three hypotheses relating the effects of three treatments to four variables: vocabulary, comprehension, composite reading and I.Q. The research design had three major components: 1) tests for differences between treatment groups, 2) tests for correlation of certain of the dependent measures, and 3) tests for interaction of I.Q. (high and low) and treatment upon dependent variables. Methods of analyses involved Analysis of Covariance as well as Correlational techniques.\nResults indicated that 1) the Experimental Treatment resulted in significant differences in vocabulary, composite reading and I.Q. but not for comprehension; 2) that certain variables correlated highly with I.Q.; 3) that the treatment effects were significant when groups were divided by I.Q.; and 4) that no interaction existed between treatment and I.Q. The researcher concluded that learning games used by economically disadvantaged parents increased the reading achievement and I.Q. scores of their children. Thus it seems that such games can provide useful tools for stimulating learning in such pupils and can provide an avenue for effectively involving parents in their children's learning processes.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

this study, we instructed parents and early childhood special education staff in Dialogic Reading, an interactive language facilitation technique. We compared the effects of this instruction on adult and child language during shared book reading and on children's vocabulary growth in three different treatment conditions. Thirty-two children with language delays were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) parent instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (b) staff instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (c) staff instruction without one-on-one shared book reading practice (control group). Children were given standardized tests of vocabulary and were videotaped during shared book reading before and after the 8-week intervention period. Parents and staff showed changes in their shared book reading style consistent with the instruction they had received. After adult instruction in Dialogic Reading, children in all three groups spoke more, made longer utterances, produced more different words, and participated more in shared book reading. The magnitude of change in the children's linguistic performance from pre- to posttest was positively correlated with the magnitude of change in adult behavior. There were no statistically significant changes in children's vocabulary test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with a Vygotskian model in which children's linguistic performance can be enhanced by a supportive social context. © 1999, Sage Publications.

this study, we instructed parents and early childhood special education staff in Dialogic Reading, an interactive language facilitation technique. We compared the effects of this instruction on adult and child language during shared book reading and on children’s vocabulary growth in three different treatment conditions. Thirty two children with language delays were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) parent instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (b) staff instruction with one-on-one shared book reading practice, (c) staff instruction without one-on-one shared book reading practice (control group). Children were given standardized tests of vocabulary and were videotaped during shared book reading before and after the 8-week intervention period. Parents and staff showed changes in their shared book reading style consistent with the instruction they had received. After adult instruction in Dialogic Reading, children in all three groups spoke more, made longer utterances, produced more different words, and participated more in shared book reading. The magnitude of change in the children’s linguistic performance from pre- to posttest was positively correlated with the magnitude of change in adult behavior. There were no statistically significant changes in children’s vocabulary test scores. We interpret these findings as consistent with a Vygotskian model in which children’s linguistic performance can be enhanced by a supportive social context.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms.

purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a preschool emergent literacy enrichment curriculum. Participants were 126 Head Start children, their teachers, and their parents. Matched centers were assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: experimental literacy, experimental math, or control. Teachers in both experimental groups implemented either literacy or math instruction in small groups on a daily basis, and parents and children completed supplementary learning activities at home. The control classroom implemented the ongoing Head Start curriculum. Children in the literacy condition showed the largest gains in phonemic awareness and emergent writing skills; they also made greater gains on emergent reading than did children in the math condition. There were no group differences on expressive vocabulary. Results are discussed in terms of curriculum design and practical issues involved in supporting preschools in the implementation of research-based instructional programs. Copyright © 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.","Comments":"MDE: Please code Literacy group versus control.\rESDE: Extract Emergent Reading as Primary outcome (using adjusted means). Phonemic awareness, emergent writing and vocabulary as secondary outcomes. Also extract Math condition as active control for Literacy group (4 outcome). No maths outcomes for maths group.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"DeBaryshe B D; Gorecki D M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1080/10409280701274741","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"DeBaryshe B D, and Gorecki D M (2007) An experimental validation of a preschool emergent literacy curriculum.

determine the effect a parent education program would have on fourth-grade student reading and mathematics standardized test scores, attitudes toward reading and mathematics, attendance, and completion of homework. Benjamin Bloom and Ravindrakumar Dave identified six environmental variables: achievement press, language models, academic guidance, activeness of the family, intellectuality in the home, and work habits in the family. These home environmental characteristics were the theme for the parent education program which was the independent variable in this experiment. The treatment consisted of parent meetings, school newsletters, and home news notes during an academic year. Forty-six nine-year-old children entering the fourth grade in a midwestern elementary school were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Effect size was used to determine the treatment effect on the following dependent variables: mathematics and reading achievement scores from the California Achievement Test, mathematics attitude score from the Attitude Toward Mathematics Scale, reading attitude score from a variation of The Attitude Toward Mathematics Scale, and homework completion rate. A t test was computed on attendance. Significance was determined at the.05 level. The findings of this study indicated that the students in the experimental group performed at a higher achievement level than did the students in the control group in both reading and mathematics, but students of the control group showed a greater interest in reading and mathematics. The students in the experimental group were more conscientious than the students in the control group with regard to the completion of homework assignments. Analysis of the attendance data indicated that there was not a significant difference between the experimental and control group with regards to school attendance.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

There were two aspects to the intervention. The first involved training teachers in how to embed metacognitive approaches in their work, and how to continue to effectively and strategically involve parents. This training took place over a day and was provided by a consultant. The second component focused on parental engagement and offered families the opportunity to participate in a series of facilitated workshops where children and parents work together to create an animated film. Sessions were coordinated by a practitioner who helped participants to think about how they are learning, create learning goals and reflect on their progress; to be metacognitive about the learning process they were engaged in together. The families were offered 2 hours of workshops per week for 5 weeks (10 hours in total). The project targeted schools in four areas of England: Birmingham, Devon, London and Manchester. It was delivered by the Campaign for Learning, with assessments carried out by Durham University. Delivery started in September 2012 and finished in October 2013. The project was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial, which compared the interventions to a ‘business-as-usual’ control group. It is important to note that it was eligibility for the animation course, not participation, that was randomised, so the results must be regarded as estimating the effect of being offered the animation course (alone or in combination with teacher training, as appropriate) rather than participating in it.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Dorsett Richard ; Rienzo Cinzia ; Niesr Heather Rolfe; Burns Helen ; Robertson Barbara-Anne ; Thorpe Benjamin ; Wall Kate ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dorsett Richard, Rienzo Cinzia, Niesr Heather Rolfe, Burns Helen, Robertson Barbara-Anne, Thorpe Benjamin, and Wall Kate (2014) Mind the Gap: Evaluation report and executive summary.

Subjects were second grade students identified as poor readers from a small northwestern Pennsylvania school district. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group received only classroom instruction. The second received classroom instruction and parent tutoring in the area of reading. The instruction provided by parents consisted of repeated reading and word flash cards drawn from material in the basal reading series. Brief training sessions were held for the parents. These consisted of direct instruction, written directions and modeling. Information gathered through curriculum-based measurement (CBM) reading probes given once a week were used to guide instructional decisions. Following these weekly assessments, parents were contacted by phone to discuss progress, possible instructional changes and treatment integrity. The study lasted six weeks. Program outcome was based on pre-test to post-test gain for words correct per minute for the median of three CBM reading probes. In order to make further comparisons the same pre-testing and post-testing was completed for a randomly selected group of second graders identified as average or better readers. At the end of the study, training and consultation were made available to parents of students in the control group. The results were in the predicted direction. The oral reading fluency of the experimental group students improved in relation to that of the control group students. Although an effect size of.52 was obtained, the improvement was not statistically significant. The students who were average or better readers showed the greatest gains in oral fluency. These gains were significantly higher than those of the control group but not the experimental group.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms.

The main aim of the study was to investigate the effects of PEEP on the children and families from the community it served. Embedded within this aim were dual objectives: to determine if the intervention had an effect within the community as a whole, and simultaneously to determine whether it had an effect on the sub?group of families who participated in the PEEP weekly sessions. Outcomes in favour of the intervention were found for parents and for children's progress in language and early literacy skills, both at community and sub?group level. The study is located within a discussion of social exclusion, the potentially mediating influence of education and the accessibility of literacy skills to intervention and change.","Comments":"Include\rMainDE: Two reports of the same study are available for data extraction\rESDE: Use Evangelou_Sylva_2007 for post-test only scores (Table 7) as Evangelou 2007 is missing SDs or CIs.\rVerbal comprehension and Early Number concepts as primary, Vocabulary and Phonological awareness as secondaries.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Evangelou Maria ; Brooks Greg ; Smith Sally ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03054980701476477","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Evangelou Maria, Brooks Greg, and Smith Sally (2007) The Birth to School Study: evidence on the effectiveness of PEEP, an early intervention for children at risk of educational under‐achievement.

According to the literature search, schools can help alleviate negative feelings if parents are encouraged to take a more active role in the education of their children; if experiences are provided that will help develop positive attitudes within parents; and if efforts are made to create a more desirable relationship between parents and the school staff. Parental involvement in the school program is extremely important to the effectiveness of the educational program in meeting the needs of children. Therefore, fostering positive parental attitudes and increasing parental involvement in schools have recently become very important goals for educators and administrators alike at all levels of the educational hierarchy. The purpose of this study was to obtain descriptive information pertinent to the effects of a parental involvement program on the attitudes of parents, self-concept, achievement, and attendance of students in an inner-city elementary school.\nMethods and Procedures: Parents in the study were categorized according to their level involvement in the program of the school. Experimental and control classes were set up in kindergarten, primary, intermediate, and upper levels. Parents were assigned to work in the experimental classes for a designated number of hours per week. Children of parents who were participants in the program were classified according to the level of participation of their parents and whether or not they were recipients of volunteer services in their classrooms. Attitudes of parents, selfconcept, achievement, and attendance of pupils were examined and analyzed.

Parents attended a training session where they received instruction in new English Language Arts Standards, the stages of the writing process, strategies for developing writing as a recursive process, and in the criteria of a scoring rubric used to evaluate their child's writing. The study consisted of three phases. In Phase 3, parents scored their child's writing sample and discussed areas of improvement with their children based on the information shared in the training session and using a writing rubric. Students in the experimental groups represented three socioeconomic classes. Results indicated that when students had an understanding of the criteria for evaluation, their writing scores improved. Moreover, when their parents became knowledgeable of the writing process and the criteria for evaluation, they were better able to interact with their children to discuss areas in need of improvement.

This model sought to enhance student performance by redefining school as the extended family for urban students and parents. A 4-year study concluded that when parents were involved with this process, student achievement and parental commitment to education far surpassed that of students and parents who remained in the more traditional school setting.","Comments":"MDE: Please code FAST students vs same school controls.\rESDE: Compare FAST students with same school controls (Building) Table 1 Classroom 1 CTBS - Reading as Primary outcome, Mathematics as Secondary.\rNext Compare FAST students with same school controls (Building) from Tables 2 - 5.

other children but there is some evidence that it might be improved if their parents are involved more in the teaching of reading by hearing their children read at home. A study was carried out of a reading at home parental involvement project in a primary school serving a working‐class area. The project was satisfactorily implemented and 76 children completed three years in it. Their reading test scores were compared to those of similar children who had passed through the school before the project. No significant improvement was found in test performance. The findings are discussed in relation to those of the Haringey Project (Tizard et al. , 1982). It is hypothesised that the effects of this form of parental involvement may depend on the nature of home visiting which supports it, on the previous extent of parental involvement, or on whether the families concerned are from ethnic minorities. It is argued that there should be continued development and evaluation of parental involvement in the teaching of reading.","Comments":"Export Date: 17 May 2019","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hannon P ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hannon P (1987) A study of the effects of parental involvement in the teaching of reading on children's reading test performance.

Also assessed was the effect of the interventions on parent participation and parent impressions of home-school connectedness. Eighty-four students in fourth- and fifth-grade evidencing poor performance in mathematics were selected. Students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: RPT plus Parent Involvement (PI), RPT Only, and Control. Prior to the interventions, students completed both curriculum-based and standardized computation measures. Measures of school adjustment were completed by the students and their teachers. Additionally, parents completed a measure assessing their level of participation in their children's learning experiences. Following the intervention, all measures were re-administered and student, parent, and teacher satisfaction were assessed.\rAnalyses of covariance indicated that students who received the RPT intervention in combination with a parent Reproduced with involvement intervention displayed the highest levels of accurate computations. Repeated measures ANCOVAs of school adjustment measures showed that RPT plus PI students received higher teacher ratings of positive academic and social behaviors than did Controls. Students involved in both RPT conditions perceived themselves as more socially confident with peers than did Controls. The measure assessing parent participation was found to be unreliable and was not used to assess pretest-posttest differences between groups. Students, parents, and teachers were highly satisfied with both RPT interventions.\rThese results replicate previous findings in which participation in the RPT intervention yielded significantly higher academic gains in mathematics than nonparticipation.\rFindings extend previous research by indicating the greater effectiveness of RPT when combined with active parent involvement. The need for a reliable, valid measure to assess parent participation in children's learning was addressed. Implications for research and practice of developing potent resources within schools were also discussed.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms.

Also studied were the effects of planned parental involvement in the affective education program. Five classrooms at each of two schools were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) affective education program, (b) affective education program with planned parental involvement, (c) control group. The students were pre- and posttested measuring: (a) self-esteem, (b) intellectual achievement responsibility (IAR), a locus of control measure, (c) alternative-thinking, (d) reading comprehension. To control for bias in regards to the self-esteem and IAR measures, the students were administered the Children's Social Desirability Questionnaire. Documentation was recorded by the researcher on (a) student fights, (b) teacher/student arguments, (c) self-initiated parent contacts, and (d) student self-referrals to the guidance counselor. Using the Toward Affective Development Program (TAD), treatment group I was involved in 23 weekly sessions, 30 minutes per session. In addition to TAD, treatment II involved newsletters and a reading seminar for parents of students. The treatment group with planned parental involvement demonstrated significantly higher gains on the self-esteem measure than control group (Group III). There were no significant differences noted between groups I and III, and I and II. Treatment groups I and II made significantly higher gains on the alternative-thinking measure than the control group. Treatment group II demonstrated the highest gain. There were no significant differences noted among the groups in intellectual achievement responsibility scores. Treatment group II reported significantly higher gains in reading achievement than the control group. There were no significant differences indicated between groups I, and II, and I and III. There were significant differences found in the percentages of fights and teacher/student arguments reported among the groups. The control group reported a higher percentage of student fights and teacher/student arguments than groups I and II. Treatment group I reported a higher percentage of student fights than treatment group II. Treatment group II reported a higher percentage of teacher/student arguments than treatment group I. There were no significant differences noted among the groups in the percentages of student self-referrals and parent contacts to the guidance counselor. The use of affective education in conjunction with parental participation warrants further investigation.","Comments":"There are 3 groups; affective education, affective education with parental involvement and control group.

whether boys read to by their fathers for the six-month period immediately preceding entrance into first grade would score significantly higher on predictor instruments for first-grade reading achievement when compared with boys read to by their mothers or boys in an unplanned situation for the same period. All boys in a central New York State school's kindergarten sections were assigned to a father -read- to , a mother-read- to , a father -not-participating, or a control (unplanned reading ) group for a six-month treatment period. The experimental groups were read to by the assigned parent reader about two or three times a week. The dependent variables were letter naming and word recognition (isolated words and words in context). The predictor criterion measures were administered individually at the conclusion of treatment, which coincided with the beginning of the boys ' first-grade school year. Within the context of the study's limitations, the results indicated that father -read- to boys had significantly higher mean scores on the words in context or criterion measure than the mother-read- to , the father -not-participating, or the control group of boys .","Comments":"MDE: Please code for mothers and fathers as treatment vs control.\rESDE: Combine Ns Means and SDs for mothers and fathers participating versus control.

As reported previously, at the end of the project children who had taken part in the parent involvement exercise were reading better than comparable children who had acted as controls. No such improvement was apparent in children given extra reading help, on a small group basis, from a supplementary teacher in school. Three years after the end of the project, the children were tested in reading by the LEA, as part of their routine monitoring and screening exercise for children transferring from junior to secondary schools. Analysis of these data revealed that the beneficial effects on reading performance of having taken part in the parent involvement exercise were still clearly apparent three years later. Again, no clear pattern of benefit could be seen in the children who had received extra teacher help as part of the project.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hewison Jenny ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8279.1988.tb00891.x","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hewison Jenny (1988) The long term effectiveness of parental involvement in reading: a follow‐up to the Haringey Reading Project.

Mothers in one group read to their children at least 15 minutes a day from a variety of picture story books considered appropriate for this group of children. The other group of children had the opportunity to take home toys from a toy library, but mothers were not asked to work with the children. As measured by a picture vocabulary test, the children experiencing the reading program made significant gains as compared to the group utilizing the toy library. This study provides further evidence for involving low-income mothers in the education of their children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Highberger R ; Brooks H ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Highberger R, and Brooks H (1973) Vocabulary growth of Head Start children participating in a mothers' reading program.

Eight boys and eight girls were selected at random from each of six second grade classrooms in two elementary schools and were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. The experimental group was given five 30 minute periods each week for 16 weeks of reading practice at home with a parent serving as tutor. At an orientation meeting parents were shown how to instruct their children, how to keep records, and how to reinforce performance. The materials used were the same basal reading texts which the pupils were using for reading instruction in school.

Table 20 sets this out in more detail. It is important to note that set-up costs have been divided equally between incentivised and unincentivised groups, although some costs arguably would be incurred in full if only one group was run (for example, the event for headteachers).\"\n\"When these figures are disaggregated by local authority, the results are quite different: respectively £754 and £366 for incentivised and unincentivised groups in Area 1, and £549 and £207 for Area 2 (see Table 21 and Table 22, respectively). The reason for the differences in per pupil costs is due to three interacting factors: 1. Staff costs were lower in Area 2. 2. The greater recruitment success in Area 2 reduced the impact of some annual fixed costs. 3.

Parents were offered the opportunity to participate in 12 Parent Academy classes, 6 on English and 6 on mathematics, delivered fortnightly by tutors with teaching qualifications and experience of teaching adults. The programme also included an educational family trip. The evaluation used a two-arm randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of two versions of the intervention. In the first version, parents were incentivised to attend with a payment of £30 per session and in the second version they were not. Children of both groups of parents were compared with a similar group whose parents were not offered Parent Academy. Sixteen schools in two urban local authorities took part in the trial. A total of 2,593 children were involved. The project also included a process evaluation which assessed how the intervention was delivered and reported on its perceived benefits. The intervention was developed by the University of Chicago. It was not manualised and involved the development of a new adult learning course. The intervention and evaluation were funded by the Education Endowment Foundation and the KPMG Foundation.

The intervention, Early Access to Success in Education (Project EASE), was designed to increase the frequency and quality of language interactions through book-centered activities and to give parents information about and opportunities for engagement in their children's developing literacy abilities. Parents received information about ways to strengthen vo- cabulary, extend narrative understanding, develop letter recognition and sound awareness, produce narrative retellings, and understand exposition. Measures of home literacy support were collected from parents and a battery of language and literacy tests were adminis- tered to intervention and comparison children prior to the interven- tion and at its conclusion.

Each family received an explanatory letter from the district administration outlin- ing the program and met with the intervention teachers individually to learn about the scope and intention of the program (only three parents refused to participate). Parents were invited to an evening meeting where the program was further explained and the proposed process of parental involvement outlined. At that meeting an overview of the year's program and an explanation of the research principles involved were given. Concurrently, control families were informed that the project was being carried out, and all agreed to allow their children to be tested as part of a comparison group. The parent training sessions were organized in five 1-month units; in each unit a parent coaching session was led by a trained parent educator, working from a scripted discussion outline to assure fidelity across schools. All relevant information was also included in a take-home guide so that the concepts addressed in the sessions could be reviewed at will. Each parent education session was followed immediately by opportunities to en- gage in structured parent-child activities designed to pro- vide practice in the desired interaction. Each of the subsequent 3 weeks, the teachers sent home a set of scripted activities incorporating the principles that were the focus for that month. These structured activities in- cluded scripted interactions and demonstrations of how to engage children in extended discussions surrounding a book. Each book to be used in the at-home activities was specifically selected because its content and text design offered lexical richness, extended discourse opp\"\n\"ties, and interesting ideas to talk about. Thus, the scripted parent-child interactions fostered the types of high-quality language interactions that research has shown to be ef- fective in promoting language development. The se- quence, including a parent education session during which literacy activities were modeled and opportunities to practice those activities with the child were given and then scripted activities that were sent home from school every week, was repeated for each of the five interven- tion units.

intervention project was carried out with 248 kindergarten students, composed of 71 students in a control group and 177 students whose parents participated in an experimental program that included parent education sessions, at-school parent/child activities, and at-home book-mediated activities. The intervention, Early Access to Success in Education (Project EASE), was designed to increase the frequency and quality of language interactions through book-centered activities and to give parents information about and opportunities for engagement in their children's developing literacy abilities. Parents received information about ways to strengthen vocabulary, extend narrative understanding, develop letter recognition and sound awareness, produce narrative retellings, and understand exposition. Measures of home literacy support were collected from parents and a battery of language and literacy tests were adminis- tered to intervention and comparison children prior to the intervention and at its conclusion. Children whose families engaged in the at- school and at-home activities made significantly greater gains in language scores as measured on subtests of vocabulary, story comprehension, and sequencing in story-telling than comparison children. The greatest gains were found in those low-achieving students who started out with low language skills at pretest and strong home literacy support. Parents in general showed high levels of par- ticipation in the prescribed activities, and they reported high levels of satisfaction. The study demonstrates the potential for schools to engage parents in a meaningful way in supporting their children's literacy development, and the sensitivity of children's oral language skills to the impact of structured enrichments.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jordan Gail E; Snow Catherine E; Porche Michelle V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1598/RRQ.35.4.5","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nFamily Literacy\r\nEmergent Literacy\r\nPrimary Education\r\nBeginning Reading\r\nKindergarten Children\r\nKindergarten\r\nProgram Descriptions\r\nParent Participation\r\nParent Student Relationship\r\nProgram Effectiveness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jordan Gail E, Snow Catherine E, and Porche Michelle V (2000) Project EASE: The Effect of a Family Literacy Project on Kindergarten Students' Early Literacy Skills.

investigation examined the efficacy of a home-based book reading intervention program for enhancing parents' use of print-referencing behaviors and for stimulating children's early literacy skills in the areas of print and word awareness. Participants included 28 parents and their typically developing 4-year-old children. Each dyad was assigned to a control or experimental group, using a pretest-posttest control group research design. Pretest measures of parents' book-reading behaviors and children's early literacy skills were collected. Each dyad then completed a home-based shared reading program, in which they read two books each week over a 4-week period. Parents in the experimental group were instructed to use nonverbal and verbal print referencing behaviors in their reading sessions. Control group parents did not receive this instruction. Posttest measures found that parents in the experimental group showed a significant increase in their use of verbal and nonverbal references to print. Results also indicated that parental use of these print referencing behaviors significantly enhanced their children's early literacy skills in several areas of print and word awareness. Clinical implications of this intervention are discussed.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Percentage agreement for the occurrence of the target behavior\nwas calculated with the following equation: (agreements / agreements + disagreements) x\n100 (Sattler, 1988).\nThe seventh grade teacher asked that classroom observations not be conducted in\nher classroom.

During these inter-observer\nagreement checks, two observers observed the same student during the same observation\nperiod. Initial calculations indicated that all observations tested for inter-observer\nagreement met the 75% agreement criterion (M = 8 8\n%, range = 78% -100%). However,\nonce the teacher-initiated positive interactions were excluded, the mean level of agreement\nfell just below the 75% agreement criterion (M = 74.6%, range = 42% -100%).

Therefore, improving academic success may serve as a protective factor against the escalation of antisocial behavior. Some research suggests that academic interventions are able to improve the academic performance of antisocial children. However, most of these studies have been conducted in restrictive settings such as special classes or juvenile detention centers. One potential method for improving a student''s academic success in a less restrictive setting is to increase the student''s engagement in school activities such as homework completion. This study investigated a model that suggested that an intervention aimed at increasing parental supervision of a routine study-time would improve the students'' level of school engagement, as measured by attendance, homework completion, and homework accuracy, and that school engagement would account for a significant amount of variance in antisocial behavior, math performance, and social interactions. Subjects were 29 middle school iv students at risk for antisocial behavior because of low academic performance and teacher reports. Students and their parents were assigned randomly to an intervention group or a control group. The intervention consisted of four main components, a video-based instructional program establishing a routine study-time, parental monitoring of the child''s routine study time, a home-school communication process using the teachers'' voice mail and the students'' school calendar, and ongoing support and consultation via weekly telephone calls to the parents. Results provided only partial support for the model. The treatment package had no significant effects on School Engagement. However, School Engagement accounted for a significant amount of variance in student math grades and teacher-reported antisocial behavior. These results suggest that school engagement may be an important target for improving grades and preventing antisocial behavior in the classroom. Issues of parental participation are discussed in the context of increasing treatment implementation.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

parent scaffolding were investigated in an experimental study. A total of 24 teachers and 400 children in Grades 3, 4, and 5 were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: control, books only, books with oral reading scaffolding, and books with oral reading and comprehension scaffolding. Books were matched to children's reading levels and interests. Children were pre- and posttested on measures of oral reading fluency (DIBELS) and silent reading ability (Iowa Test of Basic Skills [ITBS]). Results showed that children in the books with oral reading and comprehension scaffolding condition scored significantly higher on the ITBS posttest than children in the control condition. In addition, children in the two scaffolding conditions combined scored higher on the ITBS posttest than children in the control and books only conditions combined. Practical implications for summer voluntary reading interventions are discussed.

voluntary summer reading intervention with and without a parent training component were evaluated with a sample of low-income Latino children from language minority families. During the last month of 4th grade, 370 children were pretested on a measure of reading comprehension and vocabulary and were randomly assigned to (a) a treatment group in which children received 10 self-selected books during summer vacation, (b) a family literacy group in which children received 10 self-selected books and were invited with their parents to attend 3 summer literacy events (2 hr in length), and (c) a control group. Although children in the treatment group and the family literacy group reported reading more books than the control group, there was no significant effect on reading comprehension and vocabulary. Recommendations for improving the efficacy of the intervention are discussed, including efforts to improve the match between reader ability and the readability of texts and the instructional goals of the family literacy events.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Parent Readiness Education Project (PREP) on readiness skills and subsequent performance of preschool children.\n\nProcedures. This was an ex-post-facto study using summative evaluative procedures. Seven hundred and thirty-six students from the Ballard, Eastside, Ellis, Howard, and Oak Manor elementary schools in the Niles Community School District, Niles, Michigan, were used in this evaluation. All the subjects had participated in the Title III federally funded PREP screening program which selected those students with anticipated learning problems for PREP training. Two hundred and fifty-nine children received PREP training.\n\nOne-way analysis of variance and one-way analysis of covariance were used to analyze the results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, Caldwell Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills subtests. Simple t-test for independent means and correlated means were used to analyze the pretest and posttest scores of the Caldwell Preschool Inventory.\n\nResults. With the exception of the first annual group, the PREP students made significant gains in readiness skill areas in comparison to the Non-PREP and Non-Accepting PREP students. Follow-up studies at the end of kindergarten right through fourth grades continued to show significance in favor of the PREP group. In almost every case the PREP students had at least caught up with the Non-PREP students, and scored significantly higher than the Non-Accepting PREP group. However, for the first annual group the PREP students failed to close the gap between them and the Non-PREP in nine cases on the CTBS Subtests. Furthermore, they did not surpass the Non-Accepting PREP group in four subtests.\n\nConclusion. The parent-involvement variable of the PREP program is an important factor affecting the readiness skills and performance of preschool children. As a program for early identification and an intervention of learning problems, PREP is an effective project worthy of wider application.","Comments":"ESDE: Use Grade 1 outcomes on CTBS for Groups A, B and C.

Workshops are an effective method of engaging parents in the education of their children. This dissertation studies the effects of voluntary Family Science and Technology Workshops on elementary children's science interest and achievement, as well as on parents' collaboration in their child's education. The study involved 35 second and third-grade students and their parents who volunteered to participate. The parental volunteers were randomly assigned to either the control group (children attending the workshops without a parent) or the treatment group (children attending the workshops with a parent). The study was conducted in the Fall of 1995 over a four-week period. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine the effects of the workshops on children's science achievement and science curiosity, as well as on parents' involvement with their child's education. The study revealed that there was no significant statistical difference at the.05 level between the treatment/control groups in children's science achievement or science curiosity, or in parent's involvement with their children's education. However, the study did focus parental attention on effective education and points the way to more extensive research in this critical learning area. This dual study, that is, the effects of teaching basic technology to young students with the support of their parents, reflects the focus of the Salve Regina University Ph.D. program in which technology is examined in its effects on humans. In essence, this program investigates what it means to be human in an age of advanced technology.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

If the\nchild responded incorrectly or repeated the let-\nter name, the next phoneme was presented.\nThus, the number of correctly produced\nphonemes served as the dependent measure.\"\n\"Second, word tests were designed for each set\nof books. The set 1 word test sampled 51 words\n(94% of the words introduced in the set 1\nbooks) and the set 2 word test sampled 52\nwords (63% of words introduced in the set 2\nbooks).\"\n\"The third curriculum-based measure was how\nlong a child kept a packet of books before\nexchanging it for a new packet.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Kraft

purpose of this study was to examine the effects of teaching parents to deliver a carefully sequenced reading program to their kindergarten children who were not receiving formal reading instruction in school. Forty-five children and their parents enrolled in a kindergarten in a university-sponsored primary school participated in the research. Approximately twice as many children who participated in the home reading program scored in the top quartile of the Woodcock Reading Mastery (WRMT-R) word identification and word attack subtests as might be expected based on the test norms, while the children in the control group approximated the expected norms. On curriculum-based measures, the average score of children in the home reading group was higher than 87% of the children in the control group. Finally, a multiple regression analysis revealed that a significant proportion of the variance in children’s posttest performance was associated with their pretest scores on the WRMT-R letter identification subtest scores, their knowledge of the phonemes introduced in the curriculum and the consistency with which their parents implemented the home reading program.\rThe results are discussed relative to previous research in which teachers implemented the curriculum and the issues associated with utilizing parents as primary beginning reading teachers. In addition, limitations of this research and suggestions for future research are provided.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kraft Benjamin Lignugaris; Findlay Penny ; Major Julie ; Gilberts Guy ; Hofmeister Alan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"ERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nReading Research\r\nPrimary Education\r\nReading Skills\r\nProgram Implementation\r\nBeginning Reading\r\nKindergarten\r\nReading Instruction\r\nParent Participation\r\nParents as Teachers\r\nHome Instruction","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kraft Benjamin Lignugaris, Findlay Penny, Major Julie, Gilberts Guy, and Hofmeister Alan (2001) The Association between a Home Reading Program and Young Children's Early Reading Skill.

parents of 40 children in two grade 1 classrooms were randomly assigned to receive brief training in one of four instructional methods for helping their child to read or to hear their children read at

The tutoring methods were Hearing Reading , Paired Reading , Pause , Prompt , Praise , and Direct Instruction . The results showed that the use of the additional instructional strategies included in the Direct Instruction and Paired Reading tutoring methods led to faster progress by the children receiving them than by children whose parents simply heard them read.

effects of an interactive shared-reading intervention were evaluated with 3-to 4-year-old children from low-income families who attended subsidized child care. The children entered the program with oral language skills that were significantly below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) no treatment control, (b) a school condition in which children were read to by their teachers in small groups, (c) a home condition in which children were read to by their parents, and (d) a combined school plus home condition. Parents and teachers were trained in a specific form of interactive reading via an instructional videotape. The intervention was conducted for 6 weeks, after which children were posttested on standardized measures of oral language, and language samples were obtained during a shared-reading assessment. Significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and were largest for children in conditions involving home reading.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

Groups of parents and their children (usually around 5–8 families in each group) attend eight weekly 2.5-hour group sessions after school, delivered by trained local partners. Families then continue to meet on a more informal basis for up to 22 months, a period known as FASTworks. Sessions are designed to encourage good home routines around mealtimes, bedtimes and homework with the intention that this will improve the behaviour of the attending pupils, freeing up the teacher to focus on learning to the benefit of the whole class. Save the Children U.K. (SCUK) delivers FAST in U.K. primary schools. This school-level randomised controlled trial focused on pupils in Year 1 and measured the impact of FAST for the whole year group on Key Stage 1 (KS1) attainment, as well as on children’s behavioural and prosocial outcomes measured using Goodman’s (1997) Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). One hundred and fifty eight schools took part in the trial with a total of 7,207 Year 1 pupils involved at the start of the trial; and 632 Year 1 pupils taking part in the eight-week programme. A process evaluation explored the views of school leaders, school FAST co-ordinators, teachers, pupils, parents, and FAST partners through case studies and telephone interviews. The trial ran between April 2015 and September 2017.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Lord Pippa ; Styles Ben ; Morrison Jo ; White Richard ; Andrade Joana ; Bamford Susie ; Lushey Clare ; Lucas Megan ; Smith Robert ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lord Pippa, Styles Ben, Morrison Jo, White Richard, Andrade Joana, Bamford Susie, Lushey Clare, Lucas Megan, and Smith Robert (2018) Families and Schools Together (FAST): Evaluation report and executive summary.

One such intervention, carried out for two consecutive years, involved giving low and middle income parents packets of several small, easy-to-read books and guidelines for using them with their children when the parents brought their children for preschool screening provided by the school districts in the spring. Children in the first wave (year one) of the study received two additional packets of books by mail during the summer, and children in the second wave (year two) received only the packet at the screening. Children who came to kindergarten the following fall were then tested, and the results were compared with those of control classmates who had received no materials. The first year students were tested at the beginning and end of the year. Year 2 students were tested only in November. A three-variable model (gender, picture vocabulary test score, and treatment type) was used to predict end-of-kindergarten scores on knowledge of words, letters, spelling, and story. Analyses of the reading knowledge of the first year students indicated reliable and longlasting effects of the treatment. The treatment affected not only story reading but also word reading and spelling. Year 2 students showed a smaller instructional effect when compared with control students. Children's story reading was affected by the treatment, but not word reading or spelling. The diminished effect could be explained by either the earlier posttesting date or the provision of fewer materials.","Comments":"We did not find the paper refered in the meta-analysis but we found the report of the paper: McCormick & Mason, 1984.\rMDE: Please code Wave 1 and Wave 2.\rESDE: Please code for Wave 1 and Wave 2 - full data in Tables at end of report.

The parent booklet further provided advice on how to deal with problems such as childrens reading errors. It was recommended that one parent should work through the whole program with the child, but it was also possible for fathers and mothers to alternate. Essentially, each session consisted of two parts: (a) guided reading aloud (with the additional element of parents as models) and (b) an implicit strategy-training component that focused on metacognitive strategies and elaboration of text content, again with parents as models, and involves a scaffolding component, with parents helping children to answer questions or answering questions themselves. Each individual session was highly structured and standardized comprising: (a) Shared reading aloud of a text for about 15 min to support \u001fuency and vocabulary; the materials in- dicated whether each text should be read by the child or the parent.

on knowledge about the development of reading comprehension, and empirical insights into the effects of training on students' learning strategies and reading-related metacognition, we developed a parent–child reading program for implementation in the home environment. The results of this first quasi-experimental evaluation study indicate that it is generally possible to implement a program of this kind within the family setting, but that participation is low and selective based on family background and children's achievement level. Nevertheless, participation in the program was found to have substantial effects on the development of vocabulary and on reading-related metacognition, indicating that family-based reading programs have considerable potential. The issues of selective participation and the lack of a program effect on text comprehension are discussed, and prospects for future research on systematic reading training in the family context are considered.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McElvany Nele ; Artelt Cordula ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.learninstruc.2008.02.002","Keywords":"Family\r\nLiteracy training\r\nReading\r\nMetacognition\r\nMotivation\r\nReading comprehension\r\nVocabulary","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McElvany Nele, and Artelt Cordula (2009) Systematic reading training in the family: Development, implementation, and initial evaluation of the Berlin Parent–Child Reading Program.

Moreover, the study assessed whether parental supervision of English homework influenced both students' grade point averages in English and students' scores on an English literature test. Finally, the study examined student and parental attitudes and practices with English homework.\rMETHOD: Participants in this study included 94 senior (grade 1 2 ) English students and their parents. The data collected consisted of the scores on the English test and student and parental questionnaires. Students'^ tests were applied to test three hypotheses.\rRESULTS: Findings indicated that students who did English homework performed significantly better than did students who did not do English homework. This suggests that doing English homework will improve student performance on literature tests. However, there was no significant difference between the cumulative twelfth-grade grade point averages in English of students who did and students who did not receive parental supervision of their English homework, and no significant difference between scores on an English litera­ ture test of students who received parental supervision and students who did not.","Comments":"MDE: Please compare stuents with and without parental supervision.\rESDE: Please use data on Table  23 (p103) English literature tests for Students With and Without Parental Supervision","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"McGrath J B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McGrath J B (1992) Student and parental homework practices and the effect of English homework on student test scores. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"3","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407109,"AdditionalText":"50","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407108,"AdditionalText":"50","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407117,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414647,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 21:\n[¬s]\"Th-c'gample used for the praeticum was a random selection\n.\n.\nassignment of one hundred parents from a group. of'Some six hundred\nparents who indicated that they desired to participate in a project\nwhich would help them to raise their children's academic achieve-\nment in reading and mathematics.

purpose of the particum described in this paper was to teach parents tutoring skills so that they could help raise their children's academic achievement in reading and mathematics. The pupils and parents in the project represented a tri-ethnic population of blacks, whites, and Spanish surnamed. The practicum consisted of training 50 parents in reading and mathematics, two hours a week for 15 weeks, to tutor their children at home. The children of these parents were the experimental group. A group of 50 pupils whose parents were not trained in the tutoring sessions were used as the control group. Relevant data gathered during the study tends to support the two major hypotheses that, given the training program for parents, the students in the experimental group would show a significant increase in achievement over the students in the control group and the parents in the experimental group would evidence a more positive attitude toward the school. Both hypotheses were accepted with significance at the .001 level.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"McKinney J A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McKinney J A (1975) The development and implementation of a tutorial program for parents to improve the reading and mathematics achievement of their children.. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414648,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Mothers and children were randomly assigned to one of three groups[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McQueen _ Washington_1988.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407112,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407113,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414648,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"The sample was randomly selected from a pool of ninety mother-child pairs who were partici- pating in a Parent and Child Center (PCC) in Washington[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McQueen _ Washington_1988.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407117,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":414648,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"The sample consisted of sixty three and four year old children and their adolescent mothers aged 14-19.

The sample consisted of 60 mothers paired with their three or four year old children who attended full day preschool. The families were randomly assigned to one of three groups for a twelve week period. The tests used in the study were the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test; the Cultural Language Test—Mean Length of Utterance; the Cultural Language Test—Standard English; and the Conversation—Mean Length of Utterance Measure. Three major findings result from the study: 1. The children of mothers provided with intensive training and practice (Group 1) scored significantly higher on all four tests than did the children whose mothers received minimal help (Group 2) or children whose mothers received no help at all (Group 3). 2. Group 2 children did not score any higher than did Group 3. 3. Group 1 mothers scored significantly higher on all measures. © 1988 Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, Inc.","Comments":"MDE: Please code group 1 vs group 3","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McQueen A B; Washington V ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0300443880330111","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McQueen A B, and Washington V (1988) Effect of Intervention on the Language Facility of Poor, Black Adolescent Mothers and their Preschool Children.

Children assessed on two standardized reading tests showed statistically significant differences after 6 months, but these differences later disappeared. When analyses were limited to those pairs of children in which the parent of the experimental group child had participated more completely in the tutoring program, there were both immediate and long-term statistically significant differences between the groups. It is concluded that parent tutoring programs can be an effective supplement to compensatory education programs but a substantial number of parents do not participate in such programs. The failure to account for degree of participation in previous research on parent involvement may account for the contradictory findings often reported.","Comments":"SubjectsTermNotLitGenreText - Compensatory Education 1978ER5 3164ER5 1967 3150; 6848ER5 7603ER5 3831ER5 8043ER5 4558ER5 3947ER5 6823 3932 8016 4542 7577 3816; Parent Participation 7576ER5 7641ER5 912ER5 7550 7615 909; 8208ER5 3366ER5 3382ER5 3164ER5 3098ER5 8179 3352 3368 3150 3085; Reading Difficulties 8667ER5 8264ER5 8635 8234; 8676ER5 5016ER5 8644 4999; Reading Instruction 8678ER5 5259ER5 8646 5242; 8693ER5 5811ER5 9726ER5 1ER5 8655ER5 11271ER5 8661 8623 11225 1 5792 9690; 8835ER5 8832ER5 5259ER5 8678ER5 8654ER5 6120ER5 5771ER5 8803 8800 5242 8622 5752 6101 8646; Tutoring 11099ER5 5074ER5 5259ER5 11055 5057 5242\rCODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

involvement is beneficial to academic achievement. However, it is unclear whether training parents to assist their children succeed in school is an effective form of intervention. This study examined the effects of a manual-based parent training program on parent perception of homework problems, on the percentage of mathematics homework assignments turned in by students, and on mathematics achievement were examined. Participants included 52 fourth and fifth grade students. Students were randomly assigned to a treatment group or to a control group. Parent perceptions of homework problems were assessed using the Homework Problem Checklist. Achievement was assessed via teacher assigned mathematics grades and curriculum based mathematics probes. Outcome measures were collected at three intervals: pretest, posttest, follow-up over an 18 week period. Data analysis revealed that all subjects showed significant improvement on the percentage of homework turned in, on teacher assigned grades, and on curriculum based mathematics probes over the three time periods of the study. The only significant difference between the treatment group and the control group was found on Homework Problem Checklist scores. Homework problems for the treatment group significantly decreased when compared to control group scores.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Meteyer B V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Meteyer B V (1998) The effects of a manual-based parent training program on parents perceptions of homework problems on mathematics homework and on mathematics achievement..

The children were aged 8 to 11 and had reading delays of at least 18 months. After a mean time of 7.6 hours of Paired Reading at home, spread over six weeks, the children made gains of 2.43 months for reading accuracy and 4.36 months for reading comprehension compared with a control group which experienced respective gains of 0.81 months and 1.69 months. The differences were statistically significant for accuracy but not for comprehension. The conclusions of previous Paired Reading studies are discussed in the light of these results and suggestions are made for the evaluation of future, similar projects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Miller Andrew ; Robson D ; Bushell R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0144341860060305","Keywords":"United Kingdom (England)\r\nEngland\r\nERIC, Current Index to Journals in Education (CIJE)\r\nGrade 2\r\nReading Research\r\nGrade 3\r\nGrade 4\r\nGrade 5\r\nReading Instruction\r\nForeign Countries\r\nElementary Education\r\nReading Programs\r\nFamily School Relationship\r\nPrimary Education\r\nReading Comprehension\r\nSocial Reinforcement\r\nParent Participation\r\nSchool Attitudes","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miller Andrew, Robson D, and Bushell R (1986) Parental Participation in Paired Reading: A Controlled Study.

PR consists of two phases: simultaneous and independent reading. The PR method focuses on parent modeling, practice, praise and a positive atmosphere. Fifty-two parents of second and third graders receiving Chapter 1 services and fourth graders who received Chapter 1 services in the year prior were recruited for this study. Participants were assigned to either the experimental (PR) condition where they were trained to use the PR Program through a competency-based training format or to a wait-list control condition. Twenty-four of the 26 parents in the PR condition participated in the training. Parents were asked to read with their child using the PR method five times a week, for 10 to 15 minutes, across eight weeks and to tape record their reading sessions. Seven of those 24 parents returned all eight audio recordings of the reading sessions. Eight participants returned no tapes and 9 subjects returned between one and seven tapes. Overall reading improvement based on reading accuracy, rate and comprehension was assessed in the children, using difference scores obtained on the Paragraph Reading subtest of the Gray Oral Reading Test-Diagnostic. Child and parent perceptions of the child's reading skills and reading habits were also assessed. Comparisons were made between participants in the trained PR and untrained control conditions. Significant attrition effected the analysis of the data and an intent-to-treat-analysis was conducted. Children in the PR condition did not improve more than children in the control condition on overall reading scores. The small subset of children who completed the program did, however, improve more in their overall reading scores than their matched controls. A post-hoc analysis indicated that second and third graders who were receiving Chapter 1 services in school improved significantly in their overall reading scores and that the fourth graders, who no longer were eligible for Chapter 1 services in their school, did not show improvement over the course of this study. Implications and future directions are discussed.","Comments":"Export Date: 17 May 2019\rCODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The intervention involved text messages being sent to parents using school communications systems, such as Schoolcomms. Texts informed parents about dates of upcoming tests, whether homework was submitted on time, and what their children were learning at school. The programme was developed collaboratively by research teams from the University of Bristol and Harvard University and was delivered between September 2014 and July 2015. The trial involved 15,697 students in Years 7, 9 and 11 from 36 English secondary schools, with schools sending an average of 30 texts to each parent over the period of the trial. This study was an efficacy trial in which the developers of the intervention managed its delivery to ensure optimal implementation. It was a cluster randomised controlled trial with randomisation at the Key Stage level, designed to determine the impact of the intervention on the academic outcomes of students in English, maths, and science, and the impact on absenteeism. A process evaluation used focus groups, telephone surveys, interviews, and an online survey to provide data on implementation and to capture the perceptions and experiences of participating parents, pupils, and teachers. The project was co- funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and Nominet Trust as part of a funding round focused on digital technology.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Miller Sarah ; Davison Jenny ; Yohanis Jamie ; Sloan Seaneen ; Gildea Aideen ; Thurston Allen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Miller Sarah, Davison Jenny, Yohanis Jamie, Sloan Seaneen, Gildea Aideen, and Thurston Allen (2016) Texting Parents: Evaluation report and executive summary.

Comprehension measures. Literal, inferential, and critical comprehension were evaluated along with sense of story structure and the ability to sequence stories. The act of story retelling and rewriting is a ho- listic measure of comprehension which demonstrates not only retention of facts but also the ability to con- struct meaning by relating parts of a text to one another.\"\n\". Story retelling and story rewriting tests. Two different storybooks were used for the retelling a\"\n\"s. These were chosen for quality of plot\nstructure, including strongly delineated characters,\ndefinite setting, clear theme, obvious plot episodes, and\ndefinite resolution\"\n\"rds. Testing books were selected with\nattention to research on children's preferences in\nbooks; however, I am aware of the fact that preference\nis often individual and idiosyncratic (Monson & Sebesta,\n1991). The books involved characters and concepts that\nare reported as familiar to and of interest to second-\ngrade children. Some of the books included characters\nfrom diverse backgrounds, such as Jenny Learns a Les-\nson (Fujikawa, 1980), which pictures White, Black,\nAsian, and Hispanic children, so that all subjects could\nrelate to the stories\"\n\". The quality of the literature and its plot structure\nwas the main concern, since the purpose of the study\nwas to determine if a literature program using books\nthat will be encountered in the American school could\nimprove comprehension of story in children from di-\nverse backgrounds.

Oral and written creations of original stories.\nResearch assistants were trained to administer the oral\ndictations of original story tests individually to each\nchild; classroom teachers were trained to administer the\nwritten original stories. Dictation, which was tape re-\ncorded, was elicited in the following manner: Children\nwere shown five figures-a boy, a rabbit, an elf, a\nhouse, and an airplane-and told they could use all or\nsome of the figures to help them create their own sto-\nries. A similar procedure was followed in eliciting writ-\nten stories, but with a different set of figures-a person,\nan animal, a fantasy character, a home, and a means of\ntransportation. There were no prompts given in the\nwritten setting. If children stopped during oral presen-\ntations, however, they were asked if they had anything\nmore to add.\"\n\"ity. To measure language develop-\nment, specifically vocabulary and syntactic complexity,\noral and written language samples from the retellings\nand rewritings and original oral stories and original\nwritten samples were analyzed. The total number of\ndifferent words used served as the criterion for vocabu-\nlary development, and the average number of words\nper T-unit as the measure for syntactic complexity. In\ndevelopmental studies of oral language (Hunt, 1965;\nO'Donnell, Griffin, & Norris, 1967), researchers have\nfound the T- unit to be a reliable measure of language\ncomplexity.\"\n\"Children filled out a survey concerning their after-\nschool activities on the previous day (Greaney, 1980). It\nwas completed once before the study began and again\nat the end. Items referring to voluntary reading were\nembedded within the lists of activities. The survey\nasked children to check all the things they did after\nschool before they ate their dinner offering the follow-\ning choices: (a) played outside, (b) watched TV, (c) read\nor looked at a book, (d) read or looked at a magazine,\n(e) played with toys or games, (f) did homework, (g)\nwent to an after-school activity (sports, lessons), (h)\nwent somewhere with a grown-up, (i) listened to re-\ncords or tapes, (j) did some arts and crafts. The same list\nwas provided for children to check what they did after\ndinner until they went to sleep. In each section they\nwere to go back and circle the one thing that they liked\nto do most.\"\n\"arents completed a questionnaire about their chil-\ndren's after-school activities and about literary charac-\nteristics of their home environments. Items referring to\nvoluntary reading were embedded in the questions. The\nfollowing information was solicited from the question-\nnaire: (a) how often children chose to look at books per\nweek, (b) how many hours children engaged in televi-\nsion viewing, (c) how often the child visited the library\nand if they have a library card, (d) how often the child\nwas read to by an adult, (e) if children's books were\npresent in the home and if so how many, and (f) types\nof books their children enjoyed reading or look[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Morrow (1992).pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416351,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"Attitudes towards the reading program.

Nine second-grade classes (N = 166) were assigned to one control group and two experimental: one in a school-based program only and one in a school- and home-based program. Standardized and informal written and oral tests of comprehension were used to determine growth in literacy. Use of literature was measured by child surveys concerning after-school activities and records of books read in school and checked out to read at home. In with teachers and children determined attitudes toward the reading program. Children in the experimental groups did significantly better on all literacy measures except for the standardized test, where no differences were found. ND differences were found in the performance of the children in the home- and school-based program and the school-based program alone.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: 1) school-based intervention, 2) school and home-based intervention\r3) control.

The purpose of the program was to enhance children's achievement and interest in literacy. The family program was similar to a literature-based school program that included classroom literacy centers, teacher-modeled literature activities, and literacy center time. Meetings were held monthly, with parents, teachers, and children all working together. The program was in an inner-city school district including African American and Latino families. There were 56 children in 1st through 3rd grades (28 in the experimental group and 28 in the control). Pre- and posttest data determined achievement and motivation differences favoring the children in the family program.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morrow L M; Young J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.89.4.736","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morrow L M, and Young J (1997) A family literacy program connecting school and home: Effects on attitude, motivation, and literacy achievement.

Group T3 was composed of 14 children in a traditional day-care center. Before and after a 9-month intervention period, all Ss were tested with the Leiter International Performance Scale and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test in English and Spanish. On all measures, T1 made significantly greater gains than T2 or T3, indicating the greater effectiveness of the planned Bilingual Early Childhood Education Program.","Comments":"MDE: Please code T2 vs T3","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Nedler Shari ; Sebera Peggy ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2307/1127080","Keywords":"Social sciences -- Population studies -- Human populations\nBehavioral sciences -- Sociology -- Human societies\nEducation -- Formal education -- Pedagogy\nBehavioral sciences -- Psychology -- Developmental psychology\nEconomics -- Economic disciplines -- Labor economics\nBiological sciences -- Biology -- Developmental biology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Nedler Shari, and Sebera Peggy (1971) Intervention Strategies for Spanish-speaking Preschool Children.

examine the effects of three school-to-home parent involvement communication programs on reading achievement, conduct, homework habits, attendance, and parent-student-school interactions. The method. The subjects (N = 136) scored at or below the fiftieth percentile in reading and mathematics on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills and were served in a Chapter I replacement model for reading and mathematics. The study site was Blackshear Trail School, Crisp County, Georgia, a second and third grade elementary school. Scores, ranked from highest to lowest by grade, were grouped to assure equal groups. Group A parents received monthly communication by letter. Group B parents received monthly communication by letter with an invitation from the school to visit their child's classroom and have lunch with their child. Transportation and the cost of lunch were provided by the school. Group C parents received monthly communication through home visits. Group D was the control group and received standard school communication. Parent and teacher questionnaires were completed. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine group differences. Results. Group differences attributable to the type of parent involvement communication implemented were not found. There were no significant differences among groups in terms of student reading achievement, conduct, attendance, homework habits, and parent-student-school interaction. The data from this study supported the decision to fail to reject the null hypotheses. Conclusions. This study indicated there may not be one specific communication type which is most advantageous for promoting parent involvement but that a variety of types may be best. Parent and teacher questionnaires revealed relevant information regarding different perspectives and opinions of parent involvement in terms of its effect on school and children. Parents were generally pleased with the school and expressed positive feelings regarding the school's parent involvement program. Parents' attitudes toward school, considered to be important to their child's success, may produce long range benefits to the student which were not measured by this study. Teacher's opinions varied as to the most effective method for involving parents but all indicated a belief that schools should involve parents in their child's education.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The subjects were 159 first-, second-, and third-grade children who read at least one year below grade level. The parents who tutored their children used an instructional guide for a ten-week period during the summer months. In addition, the supervised parents were required to attend weekly instructional workshop meetings in order to hear formal presentations regarding the program and were supervised individually each week by the author. At the end of the ten-week period, the results suggested that parental tutoring efforts were not significantly different for the children of either the supervised tutors or the unsupervised tutors. However, parental tutoring was effective in increasing children's scores in some reading subskills on the posttests.","Comments":"MDE: Please code supervised parent-tutorial group vs control.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"O’Neil A G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"O’Neil A G (1975) An investigation of parent tutorial intervention as a means of improving reading skills in the primary age child.. , University of Oregon."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":418570,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Since randomisation of group composition and of the assignment of treatment was not practically possible, the selection of two complete grade four, English-medium, classes within the same population provided comparability, as far as possible (Ker- linger, 1986), within a quasi-experimental design.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Overett & Donald_1998.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":418570,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The experimental school was randomly selected within a sub-area of Mitchells Plain.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Overett & Donald_1998.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":418570,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\" In collaboration with the principal of this school, a maximally equivalent control school in the same area was then selected according to the procedure of purposive sampling[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Overett & Donald_1998.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407112,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407153,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":418570,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"two complete grade four, English-medium, classes[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Overett & Donald_1998.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406859,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406861,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406866,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":418570,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"There was no significant difference on pre-test reading accuracy or comprehen- sion levels between the two groups.

The study was conducted in an educationally disadvantaged\nSouth African community where the effectiveness of a paired reading parent\ninvolvement programme, which stressed interaction around reading as a\nmeans of mediating meaning, was evaluated.\nAims. The research aimed to evaluate whether reading accuracy, comprehension and attitude were promoted through involving parents and other family\nmembers as mediators in a process of paired reading. Further, it aimed to\nelucidate interactive ecosystemic effects across family, school and community\nlevels.\nSamples. Two complete grade four classes (29 and 32 children respectively)\nserved as comparison groups (average age: 9 years 7 months).\nMethods. To test the significance of the improvement in reading accuracy and\ncomprehension (Neale Analysis of Reading Ability: Neale, 1966) and attitude\n(Elementary Reading Attitude Survey: McKenna & Kear, 1990) for the\nexperimental group relative to the control, one-tailed t-tests for independent\nsamples on the respective pre-test/post-test difference scores were applied.\nResults. Statistically significant improvements in reading accuracy and comprehension, as well as reading attitude and involvement, were demonstrated.\nA broad ecosystemic analysis suggested that positive relationships between\nchildren and significant others in the family were nurtured and other children\nin the family were benefiting. Interactions between family and school, and\nschool and the local community library, were also enhanced.\nConclusions. The study emphasises the importance of developing mediation\ninsights and skills in parent involvement programmes, and the place of\necosystemic analysis in understanding the social dynamics involved in such\nprogrammes.

This relation is consistent and robust, but fails to consider additional factors that may be influential in predicting children's literacy performance. Moreover, this relation speaks to the use of reading programs to improve children's achievement by increasing reading frequency. Two studies were conducted to examine these issues. Study 1 proposed and tested a comprehensive model of children's literacy performance where the association between children's home literacy environment, reading motivation, and achievement was mediated by children's reading exposure. A sample ( N = 116) of grade 3 and 5 children and their parents participated. Findings were in accord with the model; however, children's reading motivation was a significant and unique predictor of children's reading and spelling ability. Overall, the findings of Study 1 suggested that incorporating additional explanatory factors is necessary to children's literacy performance. Study 2 tested whether a summer reading program would improve achievement measures in a targeted sample (N = 57) of poor achievers from Study 1. Children were randomly assigned to a Book Reading Group or Control Group. Over 8-weeks children in the Book Reading Group were sent one book per week that was matched to their interest and reading level. In addition, parents acted as reading models and were trained to use skill-building strategies. As predicted, children in the Book Reading Group showed significant gains in reading compared to children in the Control Group. No group differences were found for oral language skills or reading motivation. Study 2 revealed that providing access to books and maximizing the role of parents was an effective method for improving poor achiever's literacy skills over the summer.

There are many simple things you can do at home to help\nyour child become a better reader.\n1 . Reading to your child everyday is the most important thing you\ncan do to help your child learn to read. Fifteen minutes per day\ncan make a difference in whether or not your child becomes a\nreader. Men should make an extra effort to read to their children.\nMost primary teachers are women, so many young boys associate\nreading with women or schoolwork. If you are not a good reader,\nyou can still encourage your child. As your children learn to\nread, ask them to read to you. Talk about books they have read.\nAsk a friend or relative to read to your child.\n♦Try to set aside a regular time everyday for reading aloud.\nBedtime is a natural read-aloud time. Other busy families\nmight read aloud at breakfast or just after dinner.\n♦Sit close to your child when you read a book. This will be a\nspecial time that many children always remember.\n*Talk about the pictures. Occasionally, ask questions such as,\n\"What do you think will happen next?\"\n♦Reading should be fun and enjoyable. Choose stories you like\nso that you can read them with enthusiasm.\n2. Read yourself. Your actions really do speak louder than\nyour words. When your child sees you reading the newspaper or\ncurling up with a book, he or she will want to do the same. Try to\nspend some time reading even if you do not enjoy it.\n3. Provide your child with many reading materials.\n♦Schedule regular trips to the library.\n♦Read books, magazines, newspapers, cereal boxes, or anything\nthat you have in your home.\n♦Give books as gifts.

Some examples of things you and your\nchild can do together might include:\n♦Write letters to friends and family members.\n♦Make lists for everything. You and your child can make lists\nof groceries to buy, items to pack for a trip, books to get\nat the library, and chores to be done. Refer to these lists\noften, and ask your child to check off items as they are\npurchased, packed or accomplished.\n♦Read the television guide together to plan what television\nshows you will watch.\n5. Talk to your child. Discuss things that happen during the\nday. Answer your child's questions. Talk about books you are\nreading. Encourage your child to read and praise him when he does.\nMake reading a privilege. Say, \"You can stay up 15 minutes later\ntonight if you're reading in bed.\" Or you might say, \"Because you\nhelped with the dishes, I have some time to read you an extra\nstory.\"\nBecoming a good reader requires practice, and most children\nwill want to practice only if the task is enjoyable.

Subjects were 50 first-grade students in the Madison County, Mississippi public school system who were randomly selected and assigned to either a control or experimental group. Parents of students assigned to the experimental group received the parental training component, HELP (Home Enrichment Learning Program), while parents of students assigned to the control group received no training. After a period of approximately 15 weeks, the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests and the Elementary Reading Attitude Survey were administered to each student in the control and treatment groups. Six null hypotheses were proposed and tested. The reading achievement data were analyzed using an independent samples t-test with alpha preset at.05, power at.80, and medium effect size. Alternative hypotheses were nondirectional. Reading attitude data were analyzed with an independent samples Wilcoxon Rank Sum test with alpha preset at.05. Alternative hypotheses were nondirectional. Three null hypotheses (relating to reading achievement data) were rejected, and three null hypotheses (relating to reading attitude data) were not rejected in the study. The following conclusions were reached: (1) Parental participation in a training program designed to train parents in methods to aid beginning reading development had a positive significant effect on vocabulary development, reading comprehension, and total reading achievement of first-grade students. (2) Parental participation in a training program designed to train parents in methods to aid beginning reading development had no significant effect on recreational, academic, or total reading attitude of first-grade students.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

From a sample of 40 Newfoundland schools, schools were grouped into rural village (drawing students from one small community), rural collector (drawing students from several small communities), and urban, and four schools were randomly selected from each grouping. Schools were assigned randomly to one of the treatment groups (Little Books used in the home only, LittleBooks used in the home and school, Little Books used in the school only, and control). Complete pretest and posttest data were obtained for 309 children. Quantitative analyses showed the children entering kindergarten in this study to be at risk of school failure. On average, urban kindergartners scored higher on all measures, and village and collector students scored about the same. Differences in posttest means were not related clearly to treatment. However, the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Pretest x Treatment interaction, which showed that the lowest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they were used at home only, and the highest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they used them in school only, helps to support the hypothesis that the home has a crucial role to play in literacy development. (Three tables of data are included and 16 references are attached.)","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 arms.

Eighteen classes of kindergarten children from 12 schools participated in the study.Complete pretest and posttest data were obtained for 309 children. Quantitative analyses showed the children entering kindergarten in this study to be at risk of school failure. On average, urban kindergartners scored higher on all measures, and village and collector students scored about the same. Differences in posttest means were not related clearly to treatment. However, the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Pretest x Treatment interaction, which showed that the lowest achieving students profited most from the Little Books when they were used at home only and the highest achieving students when they used in school only, helps to support the hypothesis that the home has a crucial role to play in literacy development.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Specifically, this study identified beginning mathematics achievement levels of first-grade pupils from two elementary schools at the pre-kindergarten level, kindergarten level and on-grade-level. Beginning mathematics achievement levels were determined by a pretest using the mathematics curriculum used in Richland School District One called Progress and Review in Mathematics Education (PRIME). There were two posttest measures used. PRIME was one posttest measure and the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) was used as the other posttest measure. The results of this investigation using PRIME as the pre and posttest measure showed that the first-grade pupils from the experimental school scored significantly better in mathematics achievement than the first-grade pupils from the control school when all of the first-grade pupils, pre-k level, and on-grade-level pupils were compared. Although the experimental first-grade pupils who were categorized as kindergarten level also scored better in mathematics achievement than the corresponding control group, this difference was not significant. The results of this investigation using the CTBS as the posttest measure showed that the first-grade pupils from the control school scored significantly better in mathematics achievement than the first-grade pupils from the experimental school when all first-grade pupils and the kindergarten level first-grade pupils were compared. However, there was no significant difference in mathematics achievement at the pre-k level or the on-grade-level.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Subjects were 36 student/parent pairs assigned randomly to two treatment groups and a control group. The 15-week study comprised 5 weeks of baseline, 5 weeks of treatment, and 5 weeks of follow-up. During treatment, tutoring occurred four times each week for 20 minutes per session. Treatment effects were evaluated using curriculum-based measurement. Results showed that although parents implemented the tutoring programs as designed, neither tutoring program had a significant effect upon student reading achievement. Some individual students in LB and CB groups did experience gains in reading achievement, however. Implications for future endeavors in parent tutoring in reading are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: Please describe each arm.\rESDE: Please report CB vs control as primary outcome and LB vs c as a second primary outcome. \rCODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

study tested the effects of a fluency-based home reading program called Fast Start. Thirty beginning first-grade students, representing a wide range of early reading abilities, were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions for a period of 11 weeks. Parents and students in the experimental group received Fast Start training, weekly materials packets, and weekly telephone support. Control group parents and students received the parent involvement opportunities typical for their family and classroom. Significant effects for those students most at-risk in reading (as measured by pretest) were found on measures of Letter/Word recognition and reading fluency. Verbal and written survey information collected from the experimental group indicated generally positive perceptions of the program by parents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rasinski Timothy ; Stevenson Bruce ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/02702710590930483","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rasinski Timothy, and Stevenson Bruce (2005) The Effects of Fast Start Reading: A Fluency-BasedHome Involvement Reading Program, On the Reading Achievement of Beginning Readers.

make powerful contributions to their children's early literacy learning in school. The purpose of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate the efficacy of the Words to Go parent involvement program as part of a larger effort to reach out to parents in early literacy. Quantitative data from surveys and qualitative data from focus group meetings were collected about the Words?to?Go program and demonstrated moderate to highly favorable perceptions among parents, teachers, and students. A pretest post test comparison of first?graders? word reading, word writing ability and criterion?referenced reading test performance in two matched elementary schools showed significant effects favoring the Words?to?Go program participants.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Reutzel D Ray; Fawson Parker C; Smith John A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19388070609558445","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Reutzel D Ray, Fawson Parker C, and Smith John A (2005) Words to go!: Evaluating a first‐grade parent involvement program for “making” words at home.

retention has been the de facto policy for children with academic difficulties in many Latin American countries [Schiefelbein, E., & Wolff, L. (1992). Repetition and inadequate achievement in Latin America’s primary schools: a review of magnitudes, causes, relationships, and strategies. Washington, DC: World Bank.]. In Costa Rica, 14.9% of public school children were retained in first grade in 2002. In a study of first grade classrooms in Costa Rica, children identified as in need of repeating first grade were found to have lower levels of reading ability [Rolla San Francisco, A., Arias, M., Villers, R., & Snow, C. (in press). The importance of reading skills, prereading skills, and family in teachers’ decisions to retain children: a case study in costa rica. Aula Abierta]. There has been a greater focus in recent years on the importance of prevention of educational difficulties, versus repetition, as the most cost-effective and efficient way of providing educational opportunities to low-income children. There is little rigorous research evaluating the impact of different interventions on the early literacy skills of low-income children in developing countries as a way to prevent posterior academic difficulties. This experimental study evaluated the differential impact of three early literacy interventions—tutoring, classroom activities, and work with families—on the emergent literacy skills of low-income Costa Rican kindergarteners. Tutoring or a combination of all three interventions were the most effective, while providing high-quality materials to teachers without training had no impact, but more intensive interventions of longer duration will probably be needed to ensure long-term impact on first grade repetition and eventual school dropout. Continuing research will assess the impact of these interventions on student outcomes and repetition rates in first grade, as well as exploring the impact of the more intensive intervention of professional development.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 6 arms.

article reports on the effects of a family literacy program for first graders that had three main characteristics: (1) book reading with parents that adapts parental intervention to the child’s gradually increasing skills in reading during the school year, (2) support for writing activities, and (3) enjoyable home activities complementing the in-class teaching. The 108 participants were assigned to two treatment conditions: Workshop and Control. Pre- and post-test group comparisons indicate that the workshop program has a positive effect on the children’s performance in both reading and writing. Children produced longer texts and used better vocabulary, sentence structure and spelling. This study provides new data supporting the utility of family literacy programs by demonstrating their positive effect on writing. This confirms the importance of connecting reading and writing activities in family literacy at the beginning of learning and that parents should be invited by the teacher to intervene in these two areas rather than only in reading.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Saint-Laurent Lise ; Giasson Jocelyne ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1468798405058688","Keywords":"academic achievement,beginning reading,beginning writing,early intervention,literacy family,parent participation","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Saint-Laurent Lise, and Giasson Jocelyne (2005) Effects of a family literacy program adapting parental intervention to first graders’ evolution of reading and writing abilities.

The first workshop briefly discussed\nthe important role that parents play in supporting children's academic success and included a\nbroad overview of research evidence linking parental involvement to academic achievement.\nThe bulk of the workshop, however, was spent discussing parent-child shared book reading.\nThe workshop included a discussion on the role of shared book reading for children's reading\ndevelopment and information on how to choose books that support early reading acquisition.\"\n\"parents learned that shared\nbook reading is important for growth in children's vocabulary, general knowledge, and\ncomprehension, and children's increasing understanding of print concepts and syntactic\nstructure. The workshop presentation discussed how each of these skills is related to\nchildren's reading ability. The group also discussed the importance of creating a relaxed,\nsupportive environment during shared book reading, and that parents need to structure the\nbook reading experience so that children enjoy reading.\"\n\"To ensure that children are enjoying books, the workshop presented tips for choosing\n'good books' - books that children enjoy but are also useful for teaching phonological\nawareness and word reading. The workshop included information on the importance of\npattern, of repetitive phrases or words, of lyrical or rhythmic flow in the text, and of content\nthat appeals to children's interests.\nAt the end of the first session, the facilitator read each of the five books used for the\nchildren's camp program, demonstrating different characteristics of the books and different\ntechniques for shared reading. The techniques demonstrated how different types of books\ncould be used to support growth in children's vocabulary, general knowledge, and\ncomprehension, and children's understanding of print concepts and syntactic structure[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Seward_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416112,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 59:\n[¬s]\"Parents were encouraged to be 'expressive' readers so that, in addition to learning emergent\nliteracy skills, children also would be entertained by the book reading experience.\"\n\"The second workshop focused on phonological awareness specifically. This session\nincluded an explanation of phonological awareness and an explanation of its importance for\nreading acquisition. Parents learned that there were three types of phonological awareness\n(syllable, rhyme, and phoneme) that most often develop in sequence. Parents learned to\nrecognize their own child's level of phonological awareness and were shown how to focus\nchildren's learning at their current level.\"\n\"The second part of the workshop presented different types of phonological awareness\nskills. To demonstrate, the workshop facilitator described the phonological awareness items\nin the assessment battery. The test battery includes tasks where children are asked to identify,\nsegment, and blend phonological units. Parents also learned that other tasks, not used in this\nassessment battery, ask children to manipulate or substitute phonological units. Parents were\nasked to consider these types of activities (identifying, segmenting, blending, and\nmanipulating) when thinking of different phonological awareness activities for their own\"\n\"At the end of this workshop, parents worked in small groups to discuss the ways that\nphonological activities could be incorporated into home routines. After working in small\ngroups, parents presented different phonological awareness activities that they could perform\nat home. Working together with the facilitator, the group considered ways to modify\nchildren's favourite activities into 'phonological' activities, for example, while playing catch,\ntry to say another rhyming word each time you catch the ball; see how many rhyming words\nthe group can come up with in a row[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Seward_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":416112,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 60:\n[¬s]\"At the end of the second workshop, the facilitator again stressed the importance of\nparents taking an active role in supporting their child's learning.

evaluate the influence of a summer intervention for children showing early signs of reading delay. The project evaluated two intervention components: a two week camp for children and two training workshops for parents. Data were collected for five groups of participants. Three groups participated in one or more intervention components: parent workshops only group, child camp only group, and both parent workshops and child camp group. All children who participated in the interventions were identified by teachers as having difficulty in phonological awareness and word reading skills at the end of senior kindergarten. Two additional groups served as comparisons. Children in the 'low' comparison group had early literacy skills similar to children in the intervention groups. The 'average' comparison group included children that were identified by teachers as normally achieving in early literacy. The intervention programs sought to improve children's word reading ability by providing explicit instruction in phonological awareness and opportunities to practice other emergent literacy skills. Children participated in pre- and post-test assessments measuring literacy skills and general cognitive skills. Children in all three intervention groups showed positive change following the intervention compared to a comparison group of children with similar initial abilities who did not receive any intervention. Children who received both intervention components showed the most positive change following a follow-up assessment at the end of grade one. The frequency of home literacy activities with parents was related to positive improvement in children's phonological awareness and word reading skills. The quality of home literacy activities is also thought to be important. Results are presented in the context of the response-to-intervention framework for identifying children with reading disabilities.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 5 arms: 1) parent workshop only, 2) child camp only group, 3) parent workshop and child camp group, 4) low comparison group, and 5) average comparison group.

retardation and 20 control children. Intervention was based in part upon Sigel's theory, with 20 mothers encouraged to increase inductive, responsive, and complex behavior and the other 20, only inductive and responsive behavior. Results indicate that both procedures were effective in increasing targeted maternal and child behavior; control measures remained stable over sessions. Posttest results suggested that training procedures significantly increased treated children's cognitive skills compared to the control children; the treated children who were encouraged to increase the complexity of behavior outperformed the others. Training generalized to the home environment. Implications of the results for early intervention were discussed.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

randomized experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of Even Start, a federally supported family literacy program providing early childhood education, adult education, parenting education, and joint parent-child literacy activities to children and parents from low-literate families. The evaluation of 18 Even Start projects followed 463 families for 2 years and found no statistically significant or educationally important impacts on Even Start families when they were compared with control families on child literacy outcomes, parent literacy outcomes, or parent-child interactions. The study concludes that Even Start projects were able to properly implement family literacy programs, and the observed lack of effectiveness is attributed to a combination of 2 factors: (a) a lack of full participation on the part of families and (b) instructional services that may be ineffective because of the curriculum content or the instructional approach.

Low levels of literacy and high levels of behaviour problems in middle childhood often co‐occur. These persistent difficulties pose a risk to academic and social development, leading to social exclusion in adulthood. Although parent‐training programmes have been shown to be effective in enabling parents to support their children's development, very few parent interventions offer a combination of behavioural and literacy training. Aims. This paper (1) reports on a prevention programme which aimed to tackle behaviour and literacy problems in children at the beginning of school, and (2) presents the effects of the intervention on children's literacy. Sample. One hundred and four 5‐ and 6‐year‐old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods. This is a randomized control trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. The behavioural intervention consisted of the ‘Incredible Years’ group parenting programme combined with a new programme designed to train parents to support their children's reading at home. Results. Analyses demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on children's word reading and writing skills, as well as parents' use of reading strategies with their children. Conclusion. A structured multicomponent preventive package delivered with attention to fidelity can enable parents to support their children's reading at home and increase their literacy skills. Together with the improvement in child behaviour, these changes could improve the life chances of children in disadvantaged communities.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sylva Kathy ; Scott Stephen ; Totsika Vasiliki ; Ereky‐Stevens Katharina ; Crook Carolyn ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1348/000709907X255718","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sylva Kathy, Scott Stephen, Totsika Vasiliki, Ereky‐Stevens Katharina, and Crook Carolyn (2008) Training parents to help their children read: A randomized control trial.

A total of 28 families/31 students participated in the study. A pretest-posttest control group design was used. The experimental group subjects' parents received training in homework monitoring. The Computation section, Level 2 of the Mathematics subtest of the Stanford Achievement Test, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventories and, a \"Student Mathematics Homework Perception Scale\" constructed by the researcher were used for pre and posttest measures of achievement, self-esteem and students' perceptions. The students' grades and the percentage of homework they completed and returned for the first three quarters were obtained from their mathematics teachers. Ten of the experimental group subjects' families were interviewed at the end of the study. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between either the computation or the self-esteem posttest scores of the two groups. No significant differences were obtained for teachers' grades and the percentage of homework completed and returned. However, the grades and percentage of homework completed and returned by the experimental group showed a trend in the expected direction. A significant difference was found (p $<$.05) in the perception posttest scores of teacher involvement in mathematics homework. Significant negative correlations were found between parent level of education (p $<$.05) and self-esteem measures and between teachers' grades and self-esteem measures (p $<$.05) for the experimental group. The home interviews revealed: Positive feelings and sense of closer relationship between parents and students, a heightened sense of responsibility for mathematics homework by parents and students in their respective roles, and conflictual issues between parents and students in following the homework monitoring program.","Comments":"Export Date: 21 May 2019","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Tamayo L F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tamayo L F (1992) Hispanic parent monitoring of seventh grade mathematics homework assignments and relationship with achievement and self-esteem. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":356481,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"The trial was a two-armed, within-school, pupil-randomised efficacy trial.

The programme teaches parents strategies to support their children’s reading such as listening to children read, pausing to let them work out words, and praising them when they concentrate and problem-solve.\rThe programme was based primarily in Plymouth and was conducted with six cohorts of children and parents, one cohort each term from Spring term 2012 to Autumn term 2014. This evaluation was designed to assess the impact of the programme on children’s reading outcomes. It was a randomised controlled trial involving the parents of 808 children from 68 primary schools. Parents of Year 1 children identified as ‘struggling readers’ were recruited through their child’s school to participate in the project. Parents of the intervention children participated in ten weekly SPOKES sessions over one term and parents of children in a comparison group received books and newsletters. The impact evaluation measured the impact of SPOKES—on children’s literacy (letter identification, word identification, and phonetic awareness) and on a range of social and emotional outcomes—at the end of the programme and at six- and twelve-month follow up points. The process evaluation was designed to collect parents’ views and experiences of SPOKES, to help to explain the findings from of the impact evaluation, and to provide feedback to inform the future design and delivery of the programme.","Comments":"Code for Parental engagement (Strand Specific)\r","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Tracey Louise ; Chambers Bette ; Bywater Tracey ; Elliot Louise ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tracey Louise, Chambers Bette, Bywater Tracey, and Elliot Louise (2016) SPOKES.

paper reports the results of an intensive home-based educational intervention programme for 4- to 6-year-old children at risk of educational failure. The programme, Opstap Opnieuw (“Step-up Anew”), was developed in the Netherlands as an alternative to the well-known HIPPY-programme, of which a Dutch version was carried out in the early 1990s for ethnic minority groups, without apparent success. Building on the basic intervention strategy of HIPPY (i.e., involving mothers and paraprofessional aides), a new curriculum was developed based on recent theoretical insights in cognitive and language development, and emergent literacy and numeracy. The programme was carried out with Turkish and Moroccan immigrant families. For the Turkish group, the results were partly positive: There were modest effects of the programme on cognitive development and emergent numeracy, small effects on Turkish language development, but no effects on Dutch language development. In contrast, for the Moroccan group the effects were disappointing. The results are evaluated with respect to recent insights into effective strategies and essential ingredients of early educational intervention programmes.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 2 populations: Turkish and Moroccan.

The curriculum covered two years\r(effectively, 30 weeks in each year) and was presented to the\rmothers on weekly instructions and worksheets, which\rspecified activities for five days each week. In total, there\rwere 150 planned activities per year. Carrying out the daily\ractivities was estimated to take about 20 minutes each day. In addition to the worksheets, the programme provided all kinds of materials to be used in the activities, such as pencils,\rscissors, audiotapes with nursery rhymes and songs, and\rpicture books. Instructions to the mothers about how to carry\rout the activities were written on instruction sheets in clear,\rsimple language and, in view of the low literacy skills of many\rof the target mothers, supported by pictorial illustrations. For\rfully illiterate mothers, stories and songs were also made\ravailable on audiotape. Worksheets, instruction sheets,\rmaterials, books, and tapes were all attractively designed.\rPicture books were written by well-known authors of\rchildren’s books.\r\rThe mothers were supported by paraprofessional aides who\rwere to explain the worksheets and demonstrate appropriate\rinteractional behaviour. These paraprofessionals were experienced mothers themselves, belonged to the same communities as the target families, lived mostly in the same\rneighbourhoods, spoke their languages, but were on average\rslightly better educated. Paraprofessional aides were recruited\rlocally by the coordinators, from the Moroccan target group. They were usually known by the coordinators because of their active participation in the neighbourhood. They received an introductory training (8–10 days) and were further trained on the job by their local coordinator. According to the plan, the paraprofessionals visited the families every two weeks (planned number of visits: 15 in each year) or, alternatively, organised small group meetings in a nearby neighbourhood centre. In addition to instructing and supporting the mothers, the paraprofessionals were also asked to keep records of the actual implementation of the programme activities, thus being an essential instrument of the programme’s implementation strategy and implementation monitoring system.\r\rIn addition to the support by paraprofessionals, the programme also organised monthly group meetings (planned\rnumber of meetings: 12 per year) for the mothers in a\rneighbourhood centre, headed by the local coordinator. A\rportion of the group meetings was used for providing\radditional information on the worksheets. There was also time\rfor discussing general child-rearing themes brought in by the\rparents. However, the main purpose of the group meetings was to provide information about general principles of authoritative and emotionally supportive, sensitive-responsive interaction styles. A videotape showing a model mother-child interaction was used for demonstrating these principles.\rIn view of the fact that the target groups spoke different\rlanguages, the programme was made available in Dutch,\rTurkish, and standard Arabic.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"page 150: \rimprove school achievement in reading, writing, and math, and to reduce grade retention and referrals to special education.","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215493,"AdditionalText":"interuniversity team of experts","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"Please code for the Moroccan population only.

paper reports the results of an intensive home-based educational intervention programme for 4- to 6-year-old children at risk of educational failure. The programme, Opstap Opnieuw (“Step-up Anew”), was developed in the Netherlands as an alternative to the well-known HIPPY-programme, of which a Dutch version was carried out in the early 1990s for ethnic minority groups, without apparent success. Building on the basic intervention strategy of HIPPY (i.e., involving mothers and paraprofessional aides), a new curriculum was developed based on recent theoretical insights in cognitive and language development, and emergent literacy and numeracy. The programme was carried out with Turkish and Moroccan immigrant families. For the Turkish group, the results were partly positive: There were modest effects of the programme on cognitive development and emergent numeracy, small effects on Turkish language development, but no effects on Dutch language development. In contrast, for the Moroccan group the effects were disappointing. The results are evaluated with respect to recent insights into effective strategies and essential ingredients of early educational intervention programmes.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 2 populations: Turkish and Moroccan.

purpose of this intervention study was to examine the effects of weekly interactive science homework on family involvement in homework, student achievement, and homework attitudes. Sixth- and 8th-grade students (N = 253) participated in the 18-week study. Six classes of students completed TIPS (Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork) assignments with directions for family and parent involvement. Four classes completed noninteractive homework (no family involvement directions). Interactive students reported significantly higher levels of family involvement than did noninteractive students. Students in both groups who more regularly involved family members completed more assignments; TIPS students turned in more accurate assignments than did non-TIPS students. TIPS students also earned significantly higher science report card grades. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that TIPS interactive homework affects family involvement in homework, science attitudes, and student achievement in the middle grades.","Comments":"Export Date: 21 May 2019","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Van Voorhis F L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00220670309596616","Keywords":"Family involvement\r\nInteractive homework\r\nMiddle school students' science achievement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Van Voorhis F L (2003) Interactive homework in middle school: Effects on family involvement and science achievement.

Prior to the onset of the program the\nparaprofessionals had been trained for a period of three weeks.\nThe tasks were presented in a simple, uniform style so that the mother\nunderstood their purpose and subsequently was able to teach them to her child.\nThe tasks consisted of:\n1. Name of the task -- title.\n2. Why? -- a simplified explanation of the purpose of the specific lesson, i.e.,\nwhat the child would learn and how both the child and the mother would benefit\nfxom it.\n3. What? -- references to materials necessary for teaching the specific lesson,\nsuch as paper, pencil, crayons, etc.\n4. How? -- step-by-step instructions as to the teaching of the specific lesson.\nSuggestions were made as to the kinds of questions a mother could ask the\nchild, and ways of arousing the child's interest in the learning of the new task.\n5. What else? -- this section suggested to the mother a variety of ways in which\nshe could add to and enhance the learning of a specific task. It allowed both the\nmother and the child to explore the many ways and situations in which newly-\nlearned tasks or skills could be applied.\nSome of the teaching ideas that were incorporated into the weekly tasks\nwere: development of concepts such as time and size; recognition of colors and\nshapes; familiarity with letters and number symbols, etc.\nThe presentation of the task was followed by a role-playing session in\nwhich the paraprofessional assumed the role of the child, the mother the role of\nteacher. The mother then had a chance to practise what she had just been\ntaught. This was followed by a general discussion of the previous week's task,\nthe general objectives of the program, and other related matters. An appoint-\nment was then made for the next visit and the mother was reminded to teach the\nnew task to her child during the following week, and if possible to repeat it more\nthan once. In addition, the mother was encouraged to involve the rest of the\nfamily in the new learning situation.

Academic performance was measured by the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) mathematics battery. The researcher developed an intervention program to provide parents training on how to assist their children with mathematics homework. Parents received an overview of the skills needed to understand mathematics concepts taught to fifth grade students. In addition, teaching techniques used by the classroom teachers were discussed, the ITBS assessment was explained, and feedback was given on their child''s scores. In support of this training program, the researcher published a weekly newsletter that discussed the current training session and the children''s classroom requirements for the week. This quasi-experimental study consisted of the children of 30 parents who volunteered to come to the training sessions and a control group of 35 students whose parents did not come to training, but allowed their children to participate in the study by taking the pretest and posttest of the ITBS mathematics battery. The experimental group scored significantly higher than the control group in all sections of the ITBS and in the total battery score as well. Further examination of the means displayed a higher increase for the experimental group in all areas of the test with the exception of the concept and estimation sections. In addition, the experimental group completed and turned in significantly more homework than did the control group.

questions: (1) To what extent does a Head Start experience accelerate the rate at which disadvantaged preschoolers acquire cognitive skills? (2) Are the Planned Variation models, simply by virtue of sponsorship more effective than ordinary nonsponsored Head Start programs? and (3) Are some Planned Variation models particularly effective at imparting certain skills? The first chapter gives an overall picture of the Head Start Planned Variation study, while the second chapter summarizes data concerning background characteristics and distribution of test scores. Chapter 3 provides a general discussion of methodological issues and some of the major difficulties resulting from the study design. Chapters 4-7 attempt to present a picture of the pattern of overall effects of various programs through ranking analysis, residual analysis, analysis of covariance, and resistant analysis. The final chapters explore the question of whether the relative effectiveness of various programs is related to certain child background characteristics, such as sex, ethnicity, age, prior school experience, and mother's education. One major conclusion drawn as a result of the intermodel comparisons was that Head Start programs are quite homogeneous in their ability to promote general cognitive development.","Comments":"MDE: This report includes 11 programs that follow the Head Start.

The population included 166 fourth graders from two rural elementary schools in a mid-Atlantic state, their teachers, and their primary caregivers. Four classes at each school participated with two classes at each school forming the experimental group and the other two the control group. Achievement effects were determined after examination of mean score results on the pre/post researcher developed test (MWRT), comparisons between the mathematics mean scores on the 1995/1996 Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS), and comparisons between the second and third marking terms' mean grades in mathematics. Except for the area of Concepts on the MWRT, where the experimental group's mean was higher, no statistically significant mean differences in achievement between the experimental and the control groups were found. Surveys developed by the researcher were administered immediately prior to and following the study to determine primary caregivers' and teachers' opinions about primary caregiver involvement in their children's schoolwork at home. Statistically significant mean differences were found for one item which asked primary caregivers if they believed they could help their children with mathematics. Survey responses indicated that, after participation in the study, primary caregivers lost some confidence in their ability to help their children with mathematics homework. Other responses suggested primary caregivers wanted to be involved in their children's schoolwork but needed assistance from the school. Teachers indicated they needed more information on how to involve primary caregivers. Further study is recommended to examine achievement effects after using TIPS Math activities for more than one marking period. Additional study is also recommended to examine achievement effects on a variety of grade levels.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"White Merry Spence; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"White Merry Spence (1996) The effects of TIPS Math activities on fourth grade student achievement in mathematics and on primary caregivers' and teachers' opinions about primary caregivers' involvement in schoolwork. , University of Maryland at College Park."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023565,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406849,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":431234,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Classrooms were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions.

of 4-year-olds attending Head Start were randomly assigned to an intervention condition, involving an add-on emergent literacy curriculum, or a control condition, involving the regular Head Start curriculum. Children in the intervention condition experienced interactive book reading at home and in the classroom as well as a classroom-based sound and letter awareness program. Children were pretested and posttested on standardized tests of language, writing, linguistic awareness, and print concepts. Effects of the intervention were significant across all children in the domains of writing and print concepts. Effects on language were large but only for those children whose primary caregivers had been actively involved in the at-home component of the program. One linguistic awareness subtest, involving the ability to identify the first letter and first sound of words, showed significant effects.","Comments":"Export Date: 11 June 2018","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Epstein J N; Angell A L; Payne A C; Crone D A; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.86.4.542","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Epstein J N, Angell A L, Payne A C, Crone D A, and Fischel J E (1994) Outcomes of an Emergent Literacy Intervention in Head Start.

The videotape contained two assign- ments, described in Table 3. The procedures for the adult in Table 3 were presented as a set of rules and were followed by taped vignettes of adult-child book reading that exemplified those rules. Afinalsection of the videotape consisted of vignettes of inappropriate adult-child book reading. Teachers were asked by the trainer to criticize the readers in the vignettes in terms of the rules of dialogic reading and to indicate what the adult reader should have done differently in response to the child. Following the videotape, the trainer engaged in role play with the teach- ers being trained, which involved presenting various examples of child behavior and giving the teacher feedback on her use ofthe dialogic read- ing rules. The whole training sequence took about 30 min per trainee for Part 1 and 20 min for Part 2. Part 1 and Part 2 training were sepa- rated by 3 weeks. Teachers were trained during the school day. \"\n\" Parents were trained at their child's day-care center. Train- ing sessions were held in late afternoon, just before closing time. Chil- dren were cared for by the day-care staff while a number of parents watched the training video simultaneously and then engaged in one-on- one or two-on-one role play with a trainer. As was the case for the teach- ers, parent training was delivered in two assignments, separated by 3 weeks. Parents were given three books at each assignment to be used at home during dialogic reading. The books were given to the families to keep.

The videotape contained two assign- ments, described in Table 3. The procedures for the adult in Table 3 were presented as a set of rules and were followed by taped vignettes of adult-child book reading that exemplified those rules. Afinalsection of the videotape consisted of vignettes of inappropriate adult-child book reading. Teachers were asked by the trainer to criticize the readers in the vignettes in terms of the rules of dialogic reading and to indicate what the adult reader should have done differently in response to the child. Following the videotape, the trainer engaged in role play with the teach- ers being trained, which involved presenting various examples of child behavior and giving the teacher feedback on her use ofthe dialogic read- ing rules. The whole training sequence took about 30 min per trainee for Part 1 and 20 min for Part 2. Part 1 and Part 2 training were sepa- rated by 3 weeks. Teachers were trained during the school day. C\"\n\"Parents were trained at their child's day-care center. Train- ing sessions were held in late afternoon, just before closing time. Chil- dren were cared for by the day-care staff while a number of parents watched the training video simultaneously and then engaged in one-on- one or two-on-one role play with a trainer. As was the case for the teach- ers, parent training was delivered in two assignments, separated by 3 weeks. Parents were given three books at each assignment to be used at home during dialogic reading. The books were given to the families to keep. The books were those also used by a child's teacher during dialogic reading. Parents were encouraged to read to their child daily.

effects of an interactive book reading program were assessed with children from low-income families who attended subsidized day-care centers in New York. The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 months behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (b) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (c) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests. These assessments were repeated at a 6-month follow-up. Educationally and statistically significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and follow-up on measures of expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms: 1) school plus home condition, 2) school only, and 3) control.

effects, of an interactive book reading program were assessed with children from low-income families who attended subsidized day-care centers in New York. The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 months behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (b) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (c) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests. These assessments were repeated at a 6-month follow-up. Educationally and statistically significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and follow-up on measures of expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"MDE: Please code school reading as control group vs school reading + home reading as treatment group.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Arnold D S; Epstein J N; Angell A L; Smith M ; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.30.5.679","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Arnold D S, Epstein J N, Angell A L, Smith M, and Fischel J E (1994) A Picture Book Reading Intervention in Day Care and Home for Children From Low-Income Families.

Positive effects at the end of Head Start obtained in the original study were replicated, and effects on emergent literacy skills in both cohorts were maintained through the end of kindergarten. Effects of the emergent literacy intervention did not generalize to literacy outcomes at the end of 1st and 2nd grades. Growth in emergent literacy skills and literacy skills from year to year was strongly influenced by variation in the Head Start centers and school districts attended by children in the sample. Although children in the sample began formal reading instruction with relatively low levels of emergent literacy skills, they showed substantial gains with respect to national norms by the end of 2nd grade.","Comments":"Export Date: 13 June 2018","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Crone D A; Zevenbergen A A; Schultz M D; Velting O N; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.261","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Crone D A, Zevenbergen A A, Schultz M D, Velting O N, and Fischel J E (1999) Outcomes of an emergent literacy intervention from head start through second grade.

The children were aged 8 to 9 yr. Analyses showed that the amount of time parents spent listening to a child read at home was positively related to both reading accuracy and comprehension scores. A short group-program training mothers as home reading tutors achieved the anticipated changes in mothers' behaviours: delayed intervention, increased use of meaning and contextual cues rather than direct word prompts, and greater use of praise. Children's reading accuracy was marginalJy improved and reading comprehension was significantly increased as a result of training the mothers as home reading tutors.

One of the primary\nproblems was attrition from the original sample. Approximately 49% of the children\n(i.e., 16 subjects) win were registered by their parents into the program failed to\nmaintain contact with it. Reasons for this discontinuance in the program varied.\nFive families moved from the area. One mother felt that there was too much tension\nin working with her child, so we advised discontinuance. Her child was then picked\nup by a volunteer tutor, but was removed from the rime Study. Another youngster who\nhad been working with his older brother had tole discontinued because the older brother\ncomplained of lack of time to work with his younger brother.\"\n\"A number of parents\nseemed to find it very difficult to maintain a continuing relationship with the\nPPRC. We found a rather typical pattern whereby a number of mothers were not showing\nup for appointments. The problem of failure to show for appointments was not entirely\nunexpected as many programs in poorer communities have also reported this sort of\nphenomenon. On closer examination we found that the parents' lack of follow-through\nseemed multidetermined. In some cases the program material we had chosen seemed a\nbit dry on a motivational level. Many parents seemed to have difficulty understanding\nsome of the reading programs and reluctant to admit their ignorance.

Working within a community-based child health care agency in Washington, D.C., the Parent Participation Reading Clinic offered an innovative model for providing remedial educational assistance to low-income educationally handicapped children through involvement of the child's parents or older sibling as a \"home-instructor\" in the teaching process. Thirty-eight elementary school children (19 experimental and 19 match control) participated in the study over an eight month period. As a group, the experimental children who participated in the program showed significant gains over the matched control group on eight month re-evaluation on the California Test of Basic Skills, vocabulary and comprehension reading sub-tests. The results indicated no significant positive effects among experimental subjects for increasing IQ scores as measured on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Significant results were found for the within group reassessment of the Wide Range Achievement Test (reading) and Dolch Word List Test. The general findings of this study are interpreted as supportive of further development of this alternative compensatory education model.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Wise James H; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wise James H (1972) Parent Participation Reading Clinic--A Research-Demonstration Project.

to assess the influence of parental participation in school on the assistance parents could give their children outside of the classroom. A Parent Involvement Program was developed in the Mesa, Arizona Title I schools to help raise the consistently low reading readiness scores of the kindergarteners in these schools. A random proportional stratified sample was selected from 14 kindergarten classrooms in five of these schools: 40 students whose parents did not participate in the program and 40 students whose parents did participate. Parents received instruction twice a week in working effectively with their children,making reading games; and teaching in the kindergarten classroom one day a week. The Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on letter names was administered as a pre- and post-test (the Murphy-Durrell Reading Readiness Analysis Test on phonemes was also administered as a post-test).. Results showed that all children who were taught by the parents mastered the beginning skill of letter recognition, regardless-of-whether their- own parents-attended theParent Involvement Program. However, in the more difficult task of learning phonemes, the children whose own parents attended the program, learned more letter sounds than children whose own parents did not attend.(Cs)","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Woods C ; Barnard D P; Teselle E ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Woods C, Barnard D P, and Teselle E (1974) The effect of parental involvement programs on reading readiness scores.
