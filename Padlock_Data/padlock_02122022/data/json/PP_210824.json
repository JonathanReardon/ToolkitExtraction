Using data which matches individual pupils to individual teachers, and contains both test scores and value-added, we test whether the introduction of a payment scheme based on pupil attainment increased teacher effort. Our evaluation design controls for pupil effects, school effects and teacher effects, and adopts a difference-indifference methodology. We find that the scheme did improve test scores and value added increased on average by about 40% of a grade per pupil.","Comments":"Cited By :38 Export Date: 9 October 2020","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Atkinson A ; Burgess S ; Croxson B ; Gregg P ; Propper C ; Slater H ; Wilson D ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2008.10.003","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Atkinson A, Burgess S, Croxson B, Gregg P, Propper C, Slater H, and Wilson D (2009) Evaluating the impact of performance-related pay for teachers in England.

This study analyzes the test scores of students enrolled in schools participatingin the REACH program to students enrolled in schools within AISD not participating in the program. We also investigate the relationship between student learning objectives (SLOs), the program’s primary measure of individual teacher performance, and teacher performance as measured by value -added student test scores. The AISD REACH program is associated with positive student test score gains in both math and reading during the initial year of implementation. Student test score gains are maintained in the second year, but we do not find any additional growth. We also find that SLOs are not significantly correlated with a teacher’s value-added student test scores.","Comments":"Cited By :18 Export Date: 9 October 2020","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Balch R ; Springer M G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2014.11.002","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Balch R, and Springer M G (2015) Performance pay, test scores, and student learning objectives.

This study illustrates the impact of the TAP System in 66 Louisiana schools. These are primarily high-need schools, with average free/reduced price lunch eligibility of 86%, impacting more than 32,000 students each year. The authors report evidence of a positive effect of the TAP System on student achievement using two complementary analysis strategies: (1) They found a significant positive effect of TAP on 2012-13 K-8 Assessment Index scores, controlling for previous achievement, percentage of students receiving free or reduced price lunch, school configuration, school size (number of students), and percentage of English language learners. The 66 TAP schools scored 3.7 points higher on average than non-TAP schools statewide; and (2) They also found that the TAP schools had significantly greater 2012-13 Assessment Index scores than a group of matched control schools. The TAP schools scored 5.5 points higher on average than their matched controls.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Barnett Joshua H; Wills Kellie C; Kirby Peggy C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Academic Achievement\r\nAccountability\r\nAlignment (Education)\r\nDisadvantaged Youth\r\nEconomically Disadvantaged\r\nEnglish Language Learners\r\nFaculty Development\r\nFaculty Promotion\r\nFidelity\r\nLow Income Groups\r\nModels\r\nProgram Effectiveness\r\nPromotion (Occupational)\r\nRegression (Statistics)\r\nTeacher Effectiveness\r\nTeacher Evaluation\r\nTeacher Leadership\r\nTeacher Salaries","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barnett Joshua H, Wills Kellie C, and Kirby Peggy C (2014) Comprehensive Educator Effectiveness Models That Work: Impact of the TAP System on Student Achievement in Louisiana. : National Institute for Excellence in Teaching. 1250 Fourth Street, Santa Monica, CA 90401.

The program offers yearly cash bonuses to teachers in a sample of 600 public primary schools with the lowest mean student exam scores in the province. The bonus is linked to the change in the school's average student exam scores, the change in the school's enrollment, and the level of student exam participation in the school. Bonus receipt and size are randomly assigned across schools according to whether or not the teacher is the school's head. The program increases student exam participation rates in the second and third year and increases enrollment in grade 1 in the third year. We do not find that the program increases student exam scores in any year. Mean impacts are similar across program variants. The absence of positive impacts on test scores may be due to weaknesses in the program's incentive structure and/or limitations in the program's administrative data.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use the impact on student exam scores  (Table 4 ) one year after impact (1st - column 7) - these are effect sizes (SMD) and standard errors.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barrera-Osorio Felipe ; Raju Dhushyanth ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2017.02.001 ","Keywords":"Administrative data\r\nField experiment\r\nIncentive pay\r\nPakistan\r\nPerformance pay\r\nPrimary education\r\nPublic schools\r\nTeachers","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barrera-Osorio Felipe, and Raju Dhushyanth (2017) Teacher performance pay: Experimental evidence from Pakistan.

First, to what extent is there evidence that ProComp is having an impact on student achievement? This question is examined with respect to student performance on state administered achievement tests, and with respect to trends in the attainment of SGOs incentives by ProComp participants. Second, to what extent is there evidence that ProComp is having an impact on teachers’ professional practices? This question was initially explored by conducting a series of eight focus group interviews with DPS teachers. The results of these focus groups led to additional exploratory analyses that examined how teachers perceive their year-to-year salary changes.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use the regression coefficients from Table 4.4 Model 1 Main subject impact and standardise this using the SDs in Table 4.3.

article we evaluate the effects of the introduction of group monetary incentives for teachers, based on a school performance tournament in Chile. This is particularly relevant to analyze since it is the only scaled-up incentive program for teachers in the world. We evaluate the tournament effect, that is, the effect of introducing the incentive scheme on all participant schools, both winning and losing. We compare public and private subsidized schools to private fee-paying schools following a matched difference in difference and using three different empirical approaches. We explore the heterogeneous impact of the treatment through the distribution of the probability of winning. The results indicate a positive and significant tournament effect especially for schools that are very likely to win, which we call “on the money.”","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Contreras Dante ; Rau Tomás ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1086/666955 ","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Contreras Dante, and Rau Tomás (2012) Tournament incentives for teachers: Evidence from a scaled-up intervention in Chile.

This paper reviews that evidence and presents case study evidence from a county where one high school piloted a merit pay system to reward student retention while another comparable high school maintained a traditional compensation system. A difference-in-differences analysis implies that merit pay increased retention, had no effect on grade point averages, reduced average daily attendance rates, and increased the percentage of students who failed.","Comments":"Export Date: 25 October 2020","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Eberts R ; Hollenbeck K ; Stone J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2307/3069621","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Eberts R, Hollenbeck K, and Stone J (2002) Teacher performance incentives and student outcomes.

attempts to use financial incentives for teachers to increase student achievement have been ineffective. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting the power of loss aversion—teachers are paid in advance and asked to give back the money if their students do not improve sufficiently—increases math test scores between 0.201 (0.076) and 0.398 (0.129) standard deviations. This is equivalent to increasing teacher quality by more than one standard deviation. A second treatment arm, identical to the loss aversion treatment but implemented in the standard fashion, yields smaller and statistically insignificant results. This suggests it is loss aversion, rather than other features of the design or population sampled, that leads to the stark differences between our findings and past research.

This article describes a school-based randomized trial in over 200 New York City public schools designed to better understand the impact of teacher incentives. I find no evidence that teacher incentives increase student performance, attendance, or graduation, nor do I find evidence that these incentives change student or teacher behavior. If anything, teacher incentives may decrease student achievement, especially in larger schools.

Some\nschools were thought by the district to be more ready to implement the program. To accommodate\nthe preference for schools of greater readiness, we had the program manager rate each prospective\nschool as A, B, or C, with A being most ready and C being least ready. We then assigned to the\ntreatment group the schools in group A with the highest probability (three out of four), group B\nwith the next highest probability (three out of seven), and group C with the lowest probability (two\nout of five). Comparisons between cohorts 1 and 2 in this report are weighted to reflect the unequal\ntreatment assignment probabilities (where weights are the inverse of the assignment probabilities),\nso that they represent the original sample. To reflect the theoretical probability of assignment to\ncohort 1 or 2, matched comparison schools are given an assignment probability weight of .50, where\nsuch weights are used and all three groups are compared. As discussed below, however, the featured\nresults combine cohorts 1 and 2 and therefore do not incorporate randomization weights. The\nresults did not change whether we used weights or not.

This quasi-experimental strategy does not offer the same protection against bias due to unobservable differences that the experimental strategy does. In order to infer program impacts from comparing TAP schools to matched comparison schools, we must assume that the observable characteristics used to match schools are sufficiently similar and comprehensive so that the remaining differences in outcomes can be attributed to TAP itself and not to unobserved factors, such as a dynamic principal or an especially motivated teaching staff.

Under the TAP model, teachers can earn extra pay and responsibilities through promotion to mentor or master teacher as well as annual performance bonuses based on a combination of their value added to student achievement and observed performance in the classroom. The idea behind the program is that performance incentives, combined with tools for teachers to track performance and improve instruction, should help schools attract and retain talented teachers and help all teachers produce greater student achievement. This report provides evidence on the impacts of TAP during the 2008-2009 school year, the second year of the program's rollout in CPS. Appended are: (1) Propensity Score Matching; and (2) Longitudinal Analysis of Test Score Data. (Contains 18 tables, 7 figures and 14 footnotes.)

Such incentives offer bonuses for the highest-performing teachers to move into schools serving the most disadvantaged students. In this report, we provide evidence from a randomized experiment that tested whether such a policy intervention can improve student test scores and other outcomes in low-achieving schools. The intervention, known to participants as the Talent Transfer Initiative (TTI), was implemented in 10 school districts in seven states. The highest-performing teachers in each district--those who ranked in roughly the top 20 percent within their subject and grade span in terms of raising student achievement year after year (an approach known as value added)--were identified. These teachers were offered $20,000, paid in installments over a two-year period, if they transferred into and remained in designated schools that had low average test scores. The main findings from the study include: (1) The transfer incentive successfully attracted high value-added teachers to fill targeted vacancies; (2) The transfer incentive had a positive impact on test scores (math and reading) in targeted elementary classrooms; and (3) The transfer incentive had a positive impact on teacher-retention rates during the payout period; retention of the high-performing teachers who transferred was similar to their counterparts in the fall immediately after the last payout. Seven appendixes are included: (1) Supplemental Materials for Chapters I and II; (2) Value-Added Analysis to Identify Highest-Performing Teachers; (3) Supplemental Materials for Chapter III; (4) Identification of Focal Teachers; (5) Supplemental Materials for Chapter IV; (6) Supplemental Materials for Chapter V; and (7) Supplemental Materials for Chapter VI.

Scores increased on the formula used to reward teachers, and program school students scored higher on the exams linked to teacher incentives. Yet most of the gains were focused on the teacher reward formula. The dropout rate was unchanged. Instead, exam participation increased among enrolled students. Test scores increased on exams linked to the incentives, but not on other, unrelated exams. Teacher attendance and homework assignment were unaffected, but test preparation sessions increased.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Generic","Authors":"Glewwe Paul ; Ilias Nauman ; Kremer Michael ;

ProComp was modiﬁed somewhat\nin August, 2008, increasing the bonuses associated with student achieve-\nment on the state assessment and increasing bonuses in the Market\nIncentives area.\n7 Teachers can receive payment for one Professional Development Unit\n(PDU) each year, but can “bank” them, saving them for later years if they\ncomplete more than one professional development program in a particu-\nlar year.\n8 In general, teachers are considered “probationary” during the ﬁrst\nthree years in the district.\n9 In 2010–2011, elementary schools with at least 87 percent of stu-\ndents FRL eligible, middle schools with at least 85 percent of students FRL\neligible, and high schools with 75 percent of students FRL eligible were\nconsidered “hard-to-serve” schools.\n10 Hard-to-staff designations are reviewed every year and are based on\nseveral data sources, including national, state, and district-wide data on\nthe supply of teachers.\n11 The School Performance Framework takes into account a broad range\nof measures, including CSAP and AYP performance and improvement from\nprevious years, and measures progress with respect to other schools with\nsimilar demographic characteristics.\n(these four areas are discussed in greater detail below).6\nThe bonuses that are paid out are relative to an index salary.\nIn 2010, the index salary was

This study analyzes the student achievement implications of ProComp utilizing matched student- and teacher-level data from 2003 to 2010. We find that student achievement increased during the years ProComp was implemented, but that these gains were observed for students taught by teachers enrolled in ProComp’s alternative compensation system as well as non-participating teachers. While the findings are not consistent across grades and subjects, there is some evidence that teachers voluntarily opting into ProComp are more effective than those who do not volunteer. Finally, some ProComp bonuses were well targeted towards value-added measures of teacher effectiveness while others were not.","Comments":"Cited By :21 Export Date: 9 October 2020","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Goldhaber D ; Walch J ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2012.06.007","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Goldhaber D, and Walch J (2012) Strategic pay reform: A student outcomes-based evaluation of Denver's ProComp teacher pay initiative.

Because TAP typically targets low-performing schools, assignment to the intervention is nonrandom. I use synthetic control matching methods to identify appropriate comparison units. I then use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences model to estimate the eﬀects of TAP on state achievement exam scores in reading and mathematics. I ﬁnd that students in TAP schools outperform students in comparison schools by roughly 0.15 standard deviations in mathematics. I ﬁnd smaller and less precisely estimated eﬀects on reading achievement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Hudson Sally ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hudson Sally (2010) The effects of performance-based teacher pay on student achievement. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023566,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546789,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 96:\n[¬s]\"Number of Students by Subject with Fall and Spring NWEA MAP Scores, 2010-1\"\n\"Grade\nN of Students:\nMath\nK\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n5th\n6th\"\n\"7th\n8th\n9th\n10th\nOverall\n726\n70\n74\n78\n85\n87\n82\n78\n79\n93\nN of Students:\nReading\n70\n74\n78\n85\n87\n82\n79\n82\n93\n70\n52\n852\nN of Students:\nLanguage\n77\n82\n85\n82\n78\n82\n93\n73[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Jensen_2012.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407119,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546789,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 98:\n[¬s]\"Fountain Lake students were matched to comparison students on a number of observable\nmeasures, though the matching process was based primarily on identifying students with\nidentical test scores from the Spring of 2009 and Spring of 2010, the two years of test scores\nprior to the implementation of the CPIP.32 By using this as my base criteria for matching\npurposes, I ensured that the academic performance of both Fountain Lake and FLCG students\nwas as similar as possible[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Jensen_2012.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407028,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546789,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 94:\n[¬s]\"For the third research question, “What impact did the CPIP have on student achievement\nat Fountain Lake”, I evaluated how students at Fountain Lake performed on both nationally\nadministered and Arkansas-specific assessments, as a way of capturing the overall effect of the\nintroduction of merit pay in the district on improvements in student learning.

at the Fountain Lake School District implemented the Cobra Pride Incentive Program (CPIP), a merit pay program designed to financially reward all school employees with year-end bonuses primarily for significant improvements in student achievement. At the conclusion of the 2010-11 school year, over $800,000 in bonuses were distributed to school personnel. Because of the substantial investment in this program, it was important to determine how the CPIP impacted the school counselors, teachers, and students of Fountain Lake, to see if any of the potential benefits of a merit pay program were realized. The results from this evaluation provided little evidence that this program had a positive impact at Fountain Lake. Based on interview responses, school counselors noted that they now had less time with students because of the CPIP, and were mixed in their opinions about whether or not this program was beneficial for students. Teachers responded to surveys at two different time periods—before and after they received their year-end bonuses and performance ratings—and noted that they did not support the use of merit pay in general or the CPIP specifically. The teachers also did not think the program impacted their approach to teaching, their interactions with their peers, or that the CPIP had a positive impact on students. Further, after they received their bonuses, the attitudes of teachers did not change. While Fountain Lake students did show significant growth on a national assessment, this growth could not be directly attributed to the adoption of the CPIP. However, on the Arkansas assessments, Fountain Lake students showed growth equal to or less than a demographically and academically matched comparison group. Thus, a reasonable conclusion from this evaluation is that the CPIP did not have a positive impact on student achievement, and it did not appear to have a positive impact on the counselors and teachers at Fountain Lake.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

Teachers were rewarded with cash bonuses for improving their students’ performance in high-school matriculation exams. The main identification strategy is based on measurement error in the assignment to treatment variable that produced a randomized treatment sample. The incentives led to significant improvements in test taking rates, conditional pass rates, and mean test scores. Improvements were mediated through changes in teaching methods, enhanced after-school teaching, and increased responsiveness to students’ needs. No evidence was found of manipulation of test scores by teachers.

Implemented for the first time in the 2007–2008 school year, this voluntary, three-year program provided financial rewards based on school-level performance to educators in high-needs elementary, middle, and high schools. The SPBP represents one of a growing number of pay-for-performance programs being tested around the country. In 2009, the New York City Fund for Public Schools contracted with the RAND Corporation to independently evaluate the SPBP in partnership with Vanderbilt University and the National Center on Performance Incentives (NCPI). The purpose of this two-year project was to evaluate the program’s implementation and effectiveness. This monograph is the final product of this evaluation and should be of interest to policymakers, researchers, and practitioners designing, implementing, or studying pay-for-performance programs or policies. This research was conducted by RAND Education, a unit of the RAND Corporation, and partners at Vanderbilt and NCPI. Funding to carry out the work was provided by the New York City Fund for Public Schools and NCPI.","Comments":"For further information, please check the book online, it's free access.\nChapter 7 seems to be the most relevant, so we downloaded it here for review.","TypeName":"Book, Whole","Authors":"Marsh J A; Springer M G, McCaffrey, D.F; Yuan K Epstein, Scott, Koppich, J, Kalra, N, DiMartino, C; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Marsh J A, Springer M G, McCaffrey, D.F, Yuan K Epstein, Scott, Koppich, J, Kalra, N, DiMartino, and C (2011) A Big Apple for Educators: New York City’s Experiment with Schoolwide Performance Bonuses: Final Evaluation. : "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023566,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406849,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546787,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"We sampled ﬁve districts across each of the three sociocultural regions\nof AP in proportion to population (ﬁg. 1B).7\nIn each of the ﬁve districts,\nwe randomly selected one division and then randomly sampled 10 man-\ndals in the selected division.

We present results from a randomized evaluation of a teacher incentive program implemented across a large representative sample of government-run rural primary schools in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The program provided bonus payments to teachers based on the average improvement of their students' test scores in independently administered learning assessments (with a mean bonus of 3% of annual pay). At the end of two years of the program, students in incentive schools performed significantly better than those in control schools by 0.28 and 0.16 standard deviations in math and language tests respectively. They scored significantly higher on \"conceptual\" as well as \"mechanical\" components of the tests, suggesting that the gains in test scores represented an actual increase in learning outcomes. Incentive schools also performed better on subjects for which there were no incentives, suggesting positive spillovers. Group and individual incentive schools performed equally well in the first year of the program, but the individual incentive schools outperformed in the second year. Incentive schools performed significantly better than other randomly-chosen schools that received additional schooling inputs of a similar value.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Muralidharan Karthik ; Sundararaman Venkatesh ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3386/w15323","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Muralidharan Karthik, and Sundararaman Venkatesh (2011) Teacher performance pay: Experimental evidence from India.

SOUTH CAROLINA\nFor the South Carolina analyses, we employed student-level results on the PACT (Palmetto Achievement Challenge\nTests) for 2002 and 2003, and tracked individual student change. The data available for this analysis included test scores,\nprogram status, and background information for all students. Regarding the PACT, performance levels for both English\nlanguage arts (ELA) and mathematics for 2002 and 2003 were used. Because scale scores on the PACT are not vertically\nequated (i.e., the same scale score does not represent the same level of attainment across grades on a given subject), our\nanalyses were conducted using the performance levels provided.\nMatching TAP Schools to Control Schools\nThe state provided a control school for each TAP school based on a statewide cluster analysis of all schools in the state\nof South Carolina.

Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) is a comprehensive school reform with the goal to attract, retain, motivate, and develop quality teachers. By providing teachers with career paths; compensating expert teachers for their skills, knowledge, and responsibilities; restructuring school schedules to ensure time for teacher-led professional development; introducing competitive hiring; and paying teachers based on how well they instruct and how much their students gain on achievement tests, TAP schools support and reward skilled teachers. This study examined TAP’s preliminary impact on student achievement and teacher attitudes in Arizona and South Carolina schools. Our results demonstrate that over 60 percent of TAP schools made significantly greater achievement gains than control schools in reading, language, and mathematics, and that the vast majority of teachers in TAP schools support the reform.","Comments":"Table A4 has the effect sizes","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Schacter John ; Schacter John ; Thum Yeow Meng; Reifsneider Daren ; Schiff Tamara ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schacter John, Schacter John, Thum Yeow Meng, Reifsneider Daren, and Schiff Tamara (2004) The Teacher Advancement Program Report Two: Year Three results from Arizona and Year One results from South Carolina TAP schools. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023566,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406856,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"4","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546793,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"Four of the ﬁve TAP schools are included in this analysis[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schacter & Thum, 2005.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"7","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546793,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"For each of the four TAP schools, one or more comparison schools\nwere selected[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schacter & Thum, 2005.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":546793,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 11:\n[¬s]\"Controla\"\n\"Controla\nControla\"\n\"Controlab\nControlb[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schacter & Thum, 2005.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407112,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"Not provided","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"11","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546793,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"For each of the four TAP schools, one or more comparison schools\nwere selected[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schacter & Thum, 2005.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":546793,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"Four of the ﬁve TAP schools are included in this analysis,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schacter & Thum, 2005.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406859,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546793,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"To account for differences,\nour analyses control for initial achievement\"\n\"In addition, we employ all available\ncovariates[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schacter & Thum, 2005.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5406861,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":546793,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 10:\n[¬s]\"Table 1 reports the matched spring 2000 and 2001 baseline achievement and\ndemographic data for TAP schools and their controls.

By aggressively recruiting new teachers, providing a career continuum, introducing teacher-led professional development, implementing rigorous teacher accountability, and paying teachers based on their position, teaching skills, and how much their students achieve, TAP schools change their organizational structure to support and reward high-quality instruction. This study examined TAP's preliminary impact on student achievement and teacher attitudes. Using a multivariate-multilevel model for measuring student learning, we compared the growth in achievement of students from TAP schools to the growth in achievement of students from matched controls. Our preliminary results suggest that TAP schools' achievement grew significantly (E.S.=.35 and .41 for 2001 and 2002, respectively) more than controls. However, the magnitude of the achievement gains varied by school and fidelity of implementation.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schacter John ; Thum Yeow Meng; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13803610500146202","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schacter John, and Thum Yeow Meng (2005) TAPping into High Quality Teachers: Preliminary results from the Teacher Advancement Program comprehensive school reform.

opponents counter that teachers are not motivated by money. We used regression discontinuity techniques and data on a census of the students, teachers, and schools in a large urban minority-majority school district to show receipt of a financial award did not consistently relate to higher mean student test score gains or teachers? likelihood of retention. This study contributes to the literature by focusing on the effects of award receipt rather than award eligibility, differentiating by award amount, and using data from a large district serving predominantly disadvantaged students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Shifrer Dara ; Turley Ruth López; Heard Holly ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3102/0002831217716540","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shifrer Dara, Turley Ruth López, and Heard Holly (2017) Do Teacher Financial Awards Improve Teacher Retention and Student Achievement in an Urban Disadvantaged School District?.

management (HRM) practices on student achievement and workforce flows. Since 2005, dozens of Minnesota school districts in cooperation with teachers' unions implemented P4P as part of the state's Quality Compensation program. Exploiting district variation in participation status and timing, we find evidence that P4P- centered HRM reform raises students' achievement by 0.03 standard deviations. Falsification tests suggest that gains are causal. They appear to be driven especially by productivity increases among less- experienced teachers.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sojourner Aaron J; Mykerezi Elton ; West Kristine L; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3368/jhr.49.4.945","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sojourner Aaron J, Mykerezi Elton, and West Kristine L (2014) Teacher pay reform and productivity: Panel data evidence from adoptions of Q-Comp in Minnesota.

All districts in the state are eligible to receive grants, but participation is voluntary. D.A.T.E. incentive pay plans were first implemented in Texas districts during the 2008-09 school year, and the program is currently in its third year of operation during 2010-11 with approximately $197 million in annual state funding. The D.A.T.E. program currently stands as the sole state-funded incentive pay program in Texas. However, D.A.T.E.’s first year of implementation in 2008-09 occurred at a time when Texas was operating several state-funded incentive pay programs. The three-year Governor’s Educator Excellence Grant (G.E.E.G.) program was coming to its expected completion,1 while the Texas Educator Excellence Grant (T.E.E.G.) program was in its third year of operation. During the 2008- 09 school year, these programs dedicated a combined $247 million in state funds for the implementation of locally-designed incentive pay plans. However, the Texas Legislature opted not to reauthorize T.E.E.G. during the 2009 session, redirecting a portion of its funds to expand the D.A.T.E. program from approximately $150 million to $197 million annually starting with the 2009- 10 school year. Incentive pay for teachers entered Texas state policy deliberations during the 1980s, well before G.E.E.G., T.E.E.G., and D.A.T.E. came into existence. The 1980s was a decade marked as one of the most active periods of school reform in Texas. As early as the Texas Teacher Career Ladder program in 1984, policymakers attempted to reform the single-salary schedule and introduce incentive pay for educators. Several lessons emerged from those first-generation programs and play a significant role in the design and implementation of contemporary incentive pay programs in the state. Specific lessons that have informed programs such as D.A.T.E. include the importance of (1) adequate, sustainable funding; (2) teacher involvement in program design; (3) rewarding educators for their contribution to student performance and professional collaboration; and (4) conducting independent, comprehensive program evaluations. This report presents findings from the final D.A.T.E. program evaluation, which describes the experiences and outcomes for Cycle 1 districts participating in the first two years of the program.2 Findings focus on the decisions made by districts whether or not to participate in the program, the local design preferences of D.A.T.E. incentive pay plans, and the program’s influence on teachers and students (i.e., student achievement gains, teacher turnover, and educator attitudes and practice). An overview of key evaluation findings presented in this final evaluation report follows. First, information regarding actual dissemination of incentive awards to teachers is presented. This is followed by key findings from analysis of the program’s impact on students and teachers. Finally, background information on program participation decisions and implementation experiences, the design of D.A.T.E. incentive pay plans, and educator and administrator attitudes about D.A.T.E. incentive plans is presented. Distribution of Incentive Awards to Teachers3 • Among districts with district-wide incentive plans, 42% of full-time teachers received Part 1 awards.4 Among districts with only some schools eligible for participation in D.A.T.E. (referred to here as select school incentive plans), 41% of teachers in the selected schools received Part 1 awards. The average rates of teachers receiving awards can be misleading because Dallas ISD and Houston ISD are dominating the data. Excluding those two districts, 34% of full-time teachers in districts with district-wide incentive plans and 49% of full-time teachers in the selected schools received Part 1 awards, a statistically significant difference between districts with those two types of incentive plans. • Slightly more than half (52%) of the teachers in schools participating in D.A.T.E. select school plans received either a Part 1 award or a Part 2 award, as did 54% of the teachers in districts with district-wide plans. • The average total award (i.e., considering Part 1 and Part 2 awards) for teachers in districts with district-wide plans was $1,361, while the average total award for teachers in districts with select school plans was $3,344. Nearly all (96%) of the teachers in select school plans who received a Part 1 award received a total award of at least $1,000, and 50% received a total award of at least $3,000. In contrast, 70% of the teachers in district-wide plans who received a Part 1 award received a total award of at least $1,000 and only 10% received a total award of at least $3,000. in D.A.T.E. schools than in schools across the state that did not participate in D.A.T.E. However, D.A.T.E. schools had a higher percentage of economically disadvantaged (ED) students than non-D.A.T.E. schools. When looking at D.A.T.E. and non-D.A.T.E. schools that had a similar percentage of ED students, the average TAKS passing rates were similar between the two school groups. • From the time period before to after the implementation of D.A.T.E., the difference between TAKS passing rates of D.A.T.E. and non-D.A.T.E. schools decreased, indicating that passing rates in D.A.T.E. schools were catching up to rates in non-D.A.T.E. schools. • During the first two years of the D.A.T.E. program, students in D.A.T.E. schools had greater TAKS gains than those in non-D.A.T.E. schools.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Springer Matthew G; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Springer Matthew G (2010) District Awards for Teacher Excellence ( D .

This article examines a program in which bonuses were awarded to teams of middle school teachers based on their collective contribution to student test score gains. The study employs a randomized controlled trial to examine effects of the bonus program over the course of an academic year, with the experiment repeated a second year, and finds no significant effects on the achievement of students or the attitudes and practices of teachers. The lack of effects of team-level pay for performance in this study is consistent with other recent experiments studying the short-term effects of bonus awards for individual performance or whole-school performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Springer Matthew G; Pane John F; Le Vi-Nhuan  ; Mccaffrey Daniel F; Burns Susan F; Hamilton Laura ; Stecher Brian M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Academic Achievement\r\nAchievement Gains\r\nControl Groups\r\nEducational Practices\r\nEvidence\r\nExperimental Groups\r\nExperimental Programs\r\nIncentives\r\nLikert Scales\r\nMerit Pay\r\nMiddle Schools\r\nProgram Effectiveness\r\nTeacher Attitudes\r\nTeacher Effectiveness","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Springer Matthew G, Pane John F, Le Vi-Nhuan , Mccaffrey Daniel F, Burns Susan F, Hamilton Laura, and Stecher Brian M (2012) Team pay for performance: Experimental evidence from the Round Rock Pilot Project on team incentives.

The experiment was intended to test the notion that rewarding teachers for improved scores would cause scores to rise. It was up to participating teachers to decide what, if anything, they needed to do to raise student performance: participate in more professional development, seek coaching,\ncollaborate with other teachers, or simply reflect on their practices. Thus, POINT was focused on the notion that a significant problem in American education is the absence of appropriate incentives, and that correcting the incentive structure would, in and of itself, constitute an effective intervention that improved student outcomes.\nBy and large, results did not confirm this hypothesis. While the general trend in middle school mathematics performance was upward over the period of the project, students of teachers randomly assigned to the treatment group (eligible for bonuses) did not outperform students whose teachers were assigned to the control group (not eligible for bonuses). The brightest spot was a positive effect of incentives detected in fifth grade during the second and third years of the experiment. This finding, which is robust to a variety of alternative estimation methods, is nonetheless of limited policy significance, for this effect does not appear to persist after students leave fifth grade. Students whose fifth grade teacher was in the treatment group performed no better by the end of sixth grade than did sixth graders whose teacher the year before was in the control group.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Springer M G; Ballou D ; Hamilton L ; Le V N; Lockwood J R; McCaffrey D F; Pepper M ; Stecher B M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Springer M G, Ballou D, Hamilton L, Le V N, Lockwood J R, McCaffrey D F, Pepper M, and Stecher B M (2012) Final report: Experimental Evidence from the Project on Incentives in Teaching (POINT).

indicates that effective teachers are critical to raising student achievement. However, there is little evidence about the best ways to improve teacher effectiveness, or how schools that serve the students most in need can attract and retain effective teachers. Traditional salary schedules, which pay teachers based on their years of teaching experience and degree attainment, do not reward effective teaching or provide incentives for the most effective teachers to teach in high-need schools. In 2006, Congress established the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF), which provides grants to support performance-based compensation systems for teachers and principals in high-need schools. This study focuses on performance-based compensation systems that were established under TIF grants awarded in 2010. It examines grantees' programs and implementation experiences and the impacts of pay-for-performance bonuses on educator effectiveness and student achievement. This report, the third from the study, describes the programs and implementation experiences of all 2010 TIF grantees in the 2013-014 school year, the third of four years of implementation for nearly all grantees. The main findings for all districts that received 2010 TIF grants include the following: (1) Overall implementation of TIF requirements among all 2010 TIF districts was very similar in the third year of implementation as in previous years; and (2) Few TIF districts in the third year reported that key activities related to implementation of their program were a major challenge, and districts were less likely to report major challenges in the third year than in the second year. This report also provides detailed findings from a subset of 2010 TIF grantees, the evaluation districts, that participated in a random assignment study of the pay-for-performance component of TIF. For the ten evaluation districts that completed three years of TIF implementation, the report provides an in-depth analysis of TIF implementation and the impacts of pay-for-performance bonuses on educator and student outcomes after the first (2011-2012), second (2012-2013), and third (2013- 2014) years. The main findings for the ten evaluation districts include the following: (1) Pay-for-performance had small, positive impacts on students' reading and math achievement; (2) Few evaluation districts structured pay-for-performance bonuses to align well with TIF grant guidance; and (3) Teachers' understanding of performance measures continued to improve between the second and third year of implementation, but many teachers still did not understand that they were eligible for a bonus or underestimated how much they could earn. The following are appended: (1) Supplemental Information on Study Sample, Design, Data, and Methods for Chapter II; (2) Supplemental Information on Analytic Methods for Chapter II; (3) Supplemental Findings on Programs and Experiences of All TIF Districts for Chapter III; (4) Supplemental Findings on TIF Implementation in Evaluation Districts for Chapter IV; (5) Supplemental Findings on Impacts of Pay-for-Performance on Educators' Attitudes and Behaviors for Chapter V; (6) Supplemental Findings on Impacts of Pay-for-Performance on Educator Effectiveness and Student Achievement for Chapter VI; and (7) Supplemental Findings on Factors Associated with Differences in Impacts for Chapter VI.
