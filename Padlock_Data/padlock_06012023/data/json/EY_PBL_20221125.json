Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\r\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools). Peers will normally be of similar age and socio-economic or cultural background.\r\rUniversity students tutoring primary school pupils would not usually be classified as 'peers'.","AttributeType":"Not

However, Tools differs from other curricular models in that the teacher actively supports the development of mature intentional dramatic play, while ensuring that each child is active in the selection of activities and the creation ofthe play scenarios (Bodrova & Leong, 2007). In Tools, the teacher helps children to write play plans, teaches children to plan their dramatic play together, and helps children to think about next steps during their play with the intention of fostering the development of self-regulation. Dramatic play contributes to the development of children’s self-regulation because it is an imaginary situation governed by social rules. While pretending to be a store clerk, the child must seek to behave in ways that meet the social rules for that role, curbing immediate impulses in order to think about how to represent how a clerk would act. Dramatic play leads to the internalization of rules and expectations and places demands and constraints on the child’s behavior. In thinking about the role while talking and acting the child is relying on private speech, while play plans provide an external support and children remind each other ofthe rules and roles thereby helping each other regulate their behavior. In addition, the extensive use ofsymbols (e.g., pretending a jar lid is the cat’s ball) develops abstract thought more generally.\"\n\"In Tools, the teacher’s role is not just to teach skills or facts, but to help children use tools and to learn to develop tools to facilitate learning. One ofthe tools expressly taught is the use ofexternal mediators to regulate behavior. In “Buddy Reading”\"\n\"The “Freeze Game” is another activity speciﬁcally designed to develop self-regulation and other abilities. During the\nFreeze Game, children practice self-regulation and symbolic representation.

Thus, the curriculum calls for the use of toy\n?gures (animal or human) in each ofthe learning centers in the classroom to support children’s socio-dramatic play. To assess\n?delity ofimplementation regarding materials, a 50-item “environmental features” observation instrument was developed.\nThe scale measures the presence of materials for seven features: opening activity (circle time); play; equipment; classroom\nlabeling; books; writing; and socio-dramatic play. A criterion of 80% was established as “full” implementation for each\nfeature. Reliability scores of.85–.96were obtained prior to collecting data fromthe study classrooms.

Tools teachers are expected to pose questions to the group of\nchildren, rather than to speciﬁc individuals. Fidelity of implementation in this activity was examined using video tapes of\nlarge group meetings collected midyear. We found that on average large group sessions lasted 9min in Tools classrooms\nand 19min in control classrooms. This indicated ﬁdelity to the Tools model and a clear difference between treatment and\ncontrol conditions.\"\n\"In addition, Tools teachers are expected to pose questions to the entire group simultaneously during\nrather than to individual children during large group time. Thus, ﬁdelity of teacher–child interaction was assessed by coding\nthe video-taped teacher and child large group time interactions for instances in which teachers posed questions to the group\nas “group talk” and questions to individual children as “individual talk.” Coders were na¨ıve with respect to the study’s focus\nand which classrooms were in the treatment or control conditions. Reliability scores ranged from .90 to .95. Tools teachers,\nbut not control group teachers, were found to direct signiﬁcantly more “group talk” than “individual talk.”[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Barnett

The Tools curriculum, based on the work of Vygotsky, focuses on the development of self-regulation at the same time as teaching literacy and mathematics skills in a way that is socially mediated by peers and teachers and with a focus on play. The control group experienced an established district-created model described as a 'balanced literacy curriculum with themes.' Teachers and students were randomly assigned to either treatment or control classrooms. Children (88 Tools and 122 control) were compared on social behavior, language, and literacy growth. The Tools curriculum was found to improve classroom quality and children's executive function as indicated by lower scores on a problem behavior scale. There were indications that Tools also improved children's language development, but these effects were smaller and did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance in multi-level models or after adjustments for multiple comparisons. Our findings indicate that a developmentally appropriate curriculum with a strong emphasis on play can enhance learning and development so as to improve both the social and academic success of young children. Moreover, it is suggested that to the extent child care commonly increases behavior problems this outcome may be reversed through the use of more appropriate curricula that actually enhance self-regulation.

The playworld educational practice is derived from play pedagogy and the theory of narrative learning, both developed and implemented in Scandinavia. The playworld practice consists of joint adult–child pretense based in a work of children's literature, discussion, free play, and visual art production. When compared to children under a control intervention (conventional school practices without pretend play), children who participated in the playworld practice show significant improvements in narrative length, coherence, and comprehension, although not in linguistic complexity. These findings provide further evidence concerning the role of pretense in the narrative development of young children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Baumer Sonja ; Ferholt Beth ; Lecusay Robert ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2005.08.003","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Baumer Sonja, Ferholt Beth, and Lecusay Robert (2005) Promoting narrative competence through adult–child joint pretense: Lessons from the Scandinavian educational practice of playworld.

Designed to promote sustained gains, the Research-based Developmentally Informed (REDI) Parent program (REDI-P) provided home visits before and after the kindergarten transition, giving parents evidence-based learning games, interactive stories, and guided pretend play to use with their children. To evaluate impact, two hundred 4-year-old children in Head Start REDI classrooms were randomly assigned to REDI-P or a comparison condition (mail-home math games). Beyond the effects of the classroom program, REDI-P promoted significant improvements in child literacy skills, academic performance, self-directed learning, and social competence, demonstrating the utility of the approach in promoting gains in cognitive and social-emotional skills evident after the transition into kindergarten.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bierman Karen L; Welsh Janet A; Heinrichs Brenda S; Nix Robert L; Mathis Erin T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12448","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bierman Karen L, Welsh Janet A, Heinrichs Brenda S, Nix Robert L, and Mathis Erin T (2015) Helping Head Start parents promote their children's kindergarten adjustment: The research-based developmentally informed parent program.

first years of life are foundational for children's cognitive and social–emotional development and to subsequent development in a variety of domains. In many countries, an increasing number of toddlers is enrolled in early childhood education (ECE) programs, which can facilitate early development. However, the quality of these programs is often mediocre. The present study represents a large-scale randomized control trial (87 childcare centers and 1116 toddlers) designed to elevate the quality of instruction in ECE programs serving toddlers. We show that a low-cost 20-week intervention providing teachers with sequence and scope and supportive tools to be more explicit and intentional in their interactions with children resulted in positive, mainly medium- to large-sized effects on targeted language and math skills.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bleses Dorthe ; Jensen Peter ; Slot Pauline ; Justice Laura ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2020.03.001","Keywords":"ECE quality\r\nLanguage, math, and socio-emotional outcomes\r\nRCT study\r\nSchool readiness intervention\r\nToddler classrooms","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bleses Dorthe, Jensen Peter, Slot Pauline, and Justice Laura (2020) Low-cost teacher-implemented intervention improves toddlers’ language and math skills.

Two intervention conditions and a control condition were included to determine, first, whether the block building activities themselves benefited children's spatial skills, and secondly, whether a story context further improved learning. Spatial measures included: spatial visualization, mental rotation, and block building. Results showed: for block building, interventions within a story context improved performance compared to the other two conditions. For spatial visualization, both types of block-building interventions improved performance compared to the control condition. Findings suggest: (1) storytelling provides an effective context for teaching spatial content, (2) teaching block building develops wider spatial skills, and (3) 3-dimensional mental rotation tasks show a male advantage in kindergartners.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 3 conditions. 1) block building along, 2) story context + block building & 3) control.

Two intervention conditions and a control condition were included to determine, first, whether the block building activities themselves benefited children's spatial skills, and secondly, whether a story context further improved learning. Spatial measures included: spatial visualization, mental rotation, and block building. Results showed: for block building, interventions within a story context improved performance compared to the other two conditions. For spatial visualization, both types of block-building interventions improved performance compared to the control condition. Findings suggest: (1) storytelling provides an effective context for teaching spatial content, (2) teaching block building develops wider spatial skills, and (3) 3-dimensional mental rotation tasks show a male advantage in kindergartners.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 3 conditions. 1) block building along, 2) story context + block building & 3) control.

Kindergarten students of varying socioeconomic status attending two elementary schools in the same school district participated in this repeated measures, counterbalanced design study. Students received the mandated grade-level literacy instruction with a supplemental 15 min block of time designated for play-based literacy integration during which the intervention took place. During this short time, students working in small groups were given materials (miniature items, toys, letter tiles) to practice initial letter sounds and consonant–vowel–consonant rhyming word families using either an assigned activity (control condition) or a student-invented game that practiced the same literacy concepts (experimental activity). Students instructed through the experimental condition scored significantly better on the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) assessment with a medium effect size. Additional positive academic results included practice in story-composing, sequencing ideas into a complex cause and effect chain of events; application of new vocabulary; repeated practice of phonics and phonemic awareness skills to new examples; self-regulation of emotions; communication and negotiation with peers; and imagination, fantasy, humor, and creativity. Students evidenced preference for the experimental condition, continuing to repeat their games during recess or free time and to record them in their journals. Examples of student-generated literacy games are provided.","Comments":"Please use the comparison during the first half of the intervention (before they switch roles).

Subjects in the first group received nine 20-minute sessions in which an adult attempted to enhance their make-believe play. The other group received an equal number of skills tutoring sessions. Both groups received a comparable amount of adult contact. The subjects were assessed on measures of play quality, verbal intelligence, and creativity, on three occasions: Prior to training, immediately after training, and three months later. Results showed that the play tutoring and skills tutoring treatments both resulted in stable gains in verbal intelligence and ideational fluency. Neither treatment resulted in significant increases in play quality. It was concluded that the play tutoring gains were caused by adult contact rather than by enhanced levels of play.

To assist preschool teachers’ implementation of the outcomes in the national Early Years Learning Framework for Australia, the Northern Territory (NT, Australia) has introduced the NT Preschool Curriculum. The NT Preschool Maths Games, a suite of play-based games underpinned by mathematical concepts, was developed to support the enactment of this curriculum. Here, we explore the impact of attending a preschool classroom in which the NT Preschool Maths Games is being implemented, on child learning outcomes in a pre–post intervention design. Children were assessed in regard to their number naming, counting, and Applied Problems skills. After the baseline assessments, the teachers in the intervention rooms were equipped with the NT Preschool Maths Games and attended a one-day workshop on how to use them. Compared with children in the delayed intervention group, children in the intervention group showed statistically greater gains in their mathematical competencies in a post intervention assessment. This suggests that the NT Preschool Maths Games may support the enhancement of child learning outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cohrssen Caroline ; Niklas Frank ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/09669760.2019.1629882","Keywords":"Math games\r\nNorthern Territory (Australia)\r\nearly childhood education\r\nmathematics competencies\r\npreschool children","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cohrssen Caroline, and Niklas Frank (2019) Using mathematics games in preschool settings to support the development of children’s numeracy skills.

Four preschool classrooms participated in the experiment (N= 57) and the children were 4–6 years old. In order to assess children’s attention for causal events and their understanding at the level of scientific reasoning skills, we designed a simple task in which a need for information gain was created. Compared to controls, children in the post-test showed significant learning gains in the development of the so-called control of variables strategy. Indeed, they executed more informative and less uninformative explorations during their spontaneous play. Furthermore, the importance of such programmes was discussed in the field of STEM education.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dejonckheere Peter J.

We describe our iterative intervention design to support preschoolers’ vocabulary through book reading coupled with playful learning, including the process of translating research-based methods to an authentic teacher-delivered intervention. Effectiveness of the teacher-implemented intervention was examined by comparing book reading alone versus book reading plus play in supporting vocabulary development in preschoolers (N = 227) from low-income families with diverse backgrounds. Teachers used definitions, gestures, and pictures to teach vocabulary. During play, teachers led play with story-related figurines while using target vocabulary. Ten teachers read books and engaged children in play (read + play [R + P]), and 6 used only book reading (read-only [RO]). For children in both the R + P and RO conditions, within-subjects analyses of gains on taught versus control words revealed large effects on receptive (R + P, d = 1.08; RO, d = 0.92) and expressive vocabulary (R + P, d = 1.41; RO, d =1.23). Read-only had a statistically significant effect (d = 0.20) on a standardized measure of receptive vocabulary, but there were no statistically significant differences between conditions. Moderate to large effects were found using an expressive task when words were tested 4 months after they were taught. Implications for curriculum design and the potential benefits of enhancing children’s vocabulary through book reading and playful learning are discussed.","Comments":"This study has 2 groups: 1) read & play 2) read only. Please treat group 2 as active control when comparing the groups.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dickinson David K; Collins Molly F; Nesbitt Kimberly ; Toub Tamara Spiewak; Hassinger-Das Brenna ; Hadley Elizabeth Burke; Hirsh-Pasek Kathy ; Golinkoff Roberta Michnick; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/15248372.2018.1483373","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dickinson David K, Collins Molly F, Nesbitt Kimberly, Toub Tamara Spiewak, Hassinger-Das Brenna, Hadley Elizabeth Burke, Hirsh-Pasek Kathy, and Golinkoff Roberta Michnick (2019) Effects of teacher-delivered book reading and play on vocabulary learning and self-regulation among low-income preschool children.

Variations in how children are exposed to shapes may affect the pace of their learning and the nature of their shape knowledge. Building on evidence suggesting that child-centered, playful learning programs facilitate learning more than other methods, 4- to 5-year-old children (N = 70) were taught the properties of four geometric shapes using guided play, free play, or didactic instruction. Results revealed that children taught shapes in the guided play condition showed improved shape knowledge compared to the other groups, an effect that was still evident after 1 week. Findings suggest that scaffolding techniques that heighten engagement, direct exploration, and facilitate \"sense-making,\" such as guided play, undergird shape learning.

Variations in how children are exposed to shapes may affect the pace of their learning and the nature of their shape knowledge. Building on evidence suggesting that child-centered, playful learning programs facilitate learning more than other methods, 4- to 5-year-old children (N = 70) were taught the properties of four geometric shapes using guided play, free play, or didactic instruction. Results revealed that children taught shapes in the guided play condition showed improved shape knowledge compared to the other groups, an effect that was still evident after 1 week. Findings suggest that scaffolding techniques that heighten engagement, direct exploration, and facilitate \"sense-making,\" such as guided play, undergird shape learning.

From a group of 118 lowest-performing students, 49 children were divided into two groups and received either EIVP or EIVP + Play twice weekly in thirty-minute tutoring ses- sions over the course of four months. A total of 64 words were taught. The results revealed that children who received the EVIP + Play showed more growth on both receptive-vocabulary and expressive-vocabulary measures and that more children who received EIVP + Play met the benchmark on the receptive vocabulary, measured by their performance on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT III). Addition- ally, children in the EIVP + Play group showed a steeper growth trajectory on the curriculum-based measurement tool. The premise and importance of guided play in literacy learning is discussed, and further research is suggested.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Han Myae ; Moore Noreen ; Vukelich Carol ; Buell Martha ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Han Myae, Moore Noreen, Vukelich Carol, and Buell Martha (2010) Does play make a difference?

However, most of these findings have focused on older children who are already literate, and the tests and the instruments used were designed for children in Western contexts. Aim: As there is little data on the development of visuospatial abilities in pre-literate children in African contexts, this study set out to explore the effects of using a guided block play intervention on the development of these abilities in pre-literate children. Setting: The study was carried out in two classrooms (one experimental and the other comparative) in each of two schools, one in South Africa and one in Kenya. Methods: The study used a pre-and post-test, quasi-experimental, mixed-methods approach. The intervention and test used, namely, the Visual Perception Aspects Test, were designed and validated in African contexts. Results: The data revealed that using the 6 Brick Duplo Block guided play approach statistically significantly accelerated the development of visuospatial abilities in pre-literate children in the experimental groups over those in the control groups (no intervention). The data also revealed that the greatest improvements were made among children who had few prior opportunities to engage in guided play using physical manipulatives. Conclusion: The overall findings of the study suggest that the development of aspects of visuospatial perception is accelerated when teachers use this approach to facilitate guided play. This finding has implications for promoting the development of reading, writing and numeracy skills in pre-literate children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jemutai Sarah ; Webb Paul ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.4102/sajce.v9i1.634 ","Keywords":"6 Brick Duplo Blocks\r\nAccelerated visuospatial development\r\nGuided play\r\nVPAT\r\nVisual Perception Aspects Test\r\nVisuospatial perception","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jemutai Sarah, and Webb Paul (2019) Effects of a 6 Brick Duplo Block guided play intervention on pre-literate learners’ visual perception.

improve early literacy is vital to developing countries, given the importance of early literacy for an individual's future education outcomes and subsequent human capital formation. This paper presents the impact on early grade reading outcomes of two low-cost randomized interventions in Tonga: a reading instruction intervention and a community play-based activity intervention. The first intervention aims to improve early grade reading outcomes specifically; estimated impacts are approximately 0.3 standard deviation, although in some reading domains impacts are substantial, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 standard deviation. The second intervention aims to improve school readiness and subsequently early grade reading outcomes, by providing communities with support to establish a community play-based activity. Using an instrumental variables approach, the play-based activity demonstrates positive impacts of around 0.2 standard deviation in many but not all reading domains. For the domains where a statistically significant impact is measured, the community play-based activity intervention is as at least as cost effective as the reading instruction intervention. The playbased activity intervention is shown to improve test scores by 0.21 to 0.47 standard deviation per US$100, depending on the reading test domain. The reading instruction intervention improves test scores by 0.08 to 0.34 standard deviation per US$100. These findings contribute further evidence on the effectiveness of reading instruction interventions, and possibly the first estimates of the impact of play group type interventions on primary school reading outcomes.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 2 interventions.

from Head Start programs entering kindergarten often score poorly on assessments of preliteracy and premath skills. As part of an effort to strengthen this area of the curriculum, we examined the potential of a Web-based computer program for the classroom in a study with children attending an urban Head Start center in San Diego, CA. Seventy-three children from four classes participated in the study, with 21 randomly assigned to an experimental group; remaining children served as controls. Children in the experimental group played the games on classroom computers for 20 to 30 minutes an average of 25 times over the study period, which lasted for 14 weeks. The computer program employed animated games to teach children recognition of letters, numbers, quantity, shapes, and colors. Each game had built-in assessment of performance, and was constructed with multiple levels of difficulty. At the beginning and end of the study, each child was assessed for specific knowledge within the different skill domains. At the end of the study period, children in the experimental group identified approximately 24 of 26 uppercase letters, 8 out of 10 numerals between 1 and 10, and counted 8 out of 10 items. These scores were approximately double those observed at the study’s end from full-day (FD) and part-day (PD) controls (p < 0.01). The results indicate that computer-based supplements in the classroom can be an effective way to enhance preliteracy and premath skills in the Head Start classroom","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McGivern Robert F; Hilliard Veleshia R; Anderson Julie ; Reilly Judy S; Rodriguez Alfonso ; Fielding Barbara ; Shapiro Lewis ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McGivern Robert F, Hilliard Veleshia R, Anderson Julie, Reilly Judy S, Rodriguez Alfonso, Fielding Barbara, and Shapiro Lewis (2007) Improving preliteracy and pre-math skills of Head Start children with classroom computer games.

purpose of this study was to determine if the voluntary literacy behaviors of children could be increased in type and quantity through design changes by including reading and writing materials in dramatic play areas. Thirteen preschool classes were distributed into one control group and three different experimental groups: one in which thematic play with literacy materials was guided by teachers, one in which thematic play with literacy materials was not guided by teachers, and one in which books, pencils and papers were supplied in unthemed dramatic play areas with teacher guidance. The type and quantity of literacy behaviors in each of the three experimental settings were determined by direct observation prior to intervention, during intervention, and after a delayed period of time. Literacy behaviors increased significantly in all the experimental groups over the control group. Thematic play with teacher guidance yielded greatest gains; the provision of books, pencils and paper with teacher guidance yielded the next greatest gains; and thematic play without teacher guidance yielded third greatest gains. The effect of the treatments continued after a delayed period of time.","Comments":"This study has 4 groups: (El) Thematic play with\nteacher guidance, (E2) Paper, pencil, books\nwith teacher guidance, (E3) Thematic play without\nteacher guidance and Control.

study examined the effects of three modes of story reconstruction training on the development of children’s story comprehension. One hundred and eight children in grades K-2 were assigned randomly to one of three training conditions: thematic-fantasy play, adult-lead discussion, or drawing. Children were read three books on separate occasions and exposed to the appropriate conditions in relation to each book. Story comprehension data, as measured by a two-factor, criterion-referenced test and a retell task, collected after the third session, were analyzed. Second graders’ performance on all comprehension measures was superior to the younger children’s comprehension. Thematic-fantasy play was the most effective facilitator of all measures of comprehension, particularly for kindergarteners. Enacting specific play roles seemed to have a direct effect on the ability to retell stories.","Comments":"This study has 3 groups: 1) thematic-fantasy play, 2) adult-lead\ndiscussion, and 3) drawing. Please compare group 1 vs. 3. Results are presented per different grade. Please focus on KG scores only and compare groups as indicated above.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pellegrini A D; Galda Lee ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3102/00028312019003443","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pellegrini A D, and Galda Lee (1982) The effects of thematic-fantasy play training on the development of children’s story comprehension.

Parents receive a text message directly from EasyPeasy which links to videos of example games that they can play with their children, plus tips and advice about learning through play. The games target skills within the Early Years Foundation Stage areas of learning. This project aimed to support children aged three to four in school nurseries. The intervention lasted 20 weeks, with parents receiving weekly texts linked to 65 games over this period. Use of EasyPeasy was supported by a member of nursery staff (the ‘Pod Leader’), trained by EasyPeasy. One hundred and two primary schools from nine Local Authorities across England participated in this efficacy trial from September 2017 to July 2018. The programme was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial, testing the impact of EasyPeasy on children’s language development compared to ‘business as usual’ in control schools using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF) assessment. Social, emotional, and behavioural outcomes were also assessed; 1,205 children were included in the evaluation. Interviews, case studies, focus groups, and a survey were conducted to explore how the programme was implemented and to obtain feedback from participants. EEF security rating The primary finding has a moderate to high security rating. This was an efficacy trial, which tested whether the intervention worked under everyday conditions in a large number of schools. It was a well-designed randomised controlled trial and few pupils who started the trial were not included in the final analysis: one school (1%) withdrew from the trial and did not allow post-testing to be conducted, and 6% of pupils randomised with pre-tests had missing data. There was some imbalance on language scores at baseline, which reduces the security rating. All results were confirmed by additional analyses. Additional findings. Small, non-statistically-significant effects in favour of the intervention group were observed in the individual CELF. subscale scores, each equating to a month or less of progress. Small effect sizes in favour of the intervention group were found for the CSBQ subscales of ‘sociability’, ‘emotional self regulation’, and ‘cognitive self-regulation’ (effect sizes 0.04, 0.06, and 0.14). The positive effect on cognitive self regulation is consistent with previous evaluations of EasyPeasy, and here, it is based on a teacher (rather than parent) measure. However, it is also important to note that the effect here is substantially smaller and not statistically significant.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Robinson-Smith L ; Menzies V ; Cramman H ; Wang Y ; Fairhurst C ; Hallett S ; Beckmann N ; Merrell C ; Torgerson C ; Stothard S ; Siddiqui N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Robinson-Smith L, Menzies V, Cramman H, Wang Y, Fairhurst C, Hallett S, Beckmann N, Merrell C, Torgerson C, Stothard S, and Siddiqui N (2019) EasyPeasy: Learning through play - Evaluation report. : , "},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10699481,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":838619,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Early Childhood Research Quarterly[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schmitt etal_2018.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":838619,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"semi-\nstructured block play[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schmitt etal_2018.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":838619,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"supported\ngrowth in mathematics and executive functioning for preschool children[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schmitt etal_2018.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":838619,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Children were randomly assigned within preschool\nto an intervention group (n = 24) or a business-as-usual control\ngroup (n = 35).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schmitt etal_2018.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215244,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215251,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":838619,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"The groups were not equally distributed in num-\nber of children because at most schools there were odd numbers of\nparticipating children and random assignment unequally assigned\nchildren to the control group.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schmitt etal_2018.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215255,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":838619,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"the initial prompt was given, interventionists stayed in the room to record the session; however, they allowed the children to build freely and did not participate in the building process.

A secondary aim was to explore whether differential intervention effects emerged for children from various socioeconomic backgrounds, indicated by parental education level. Participants included 59 preschool children. Children ranged in age from 38 to 69 months (M = 55.20, SD = 7.17), and 56% were female. Results from regression models indicated that, although not statistically significant, children who participated in the intervention demonstrated greater gains in three mathematics skills (numeracy, shape recognition, and mathematical language) and two indicators of executive functioning (cognitive flexibility and a measure of global executive functioning) compared to children in a control group. Further, three significant interactions were found, suggesting that for numeracy, cognitive flexibility, and global executive functioning, children of parents with low educational attainment benefited the most from intervention participation. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of a semi-structured block play intervention for improving children's school readiness and have implications for including intentional instruction using blocks in preschool classrooms.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Schmitt Sara A; Korucu Irem ; Napoli Amy R; Bryant Lindsey M; Purpura David J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2018.04.006","Keywords":"Block play\r\nExecutive function\r\nIntervention\r\nMathematics\r\nPreschool","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Schmitt Sara A, Korucu Irem, Napoli Amy R, Bryant Lindsey M, and Purpura David J (2018) Using block play to enhance preschool children's mathematics and executive functioning: A randomized controlled trial.

Children living with foster families in a resource-limited setting such as Ethiopia are at risk of developmental problems. It is not yet clear whether intensive home-based developmental stimulation assisted by play can reduce these problems. The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of play-assisted intervention integrated into basic services on the developmental performance of children living with foster families in extreme poverty. METHODS: A randomized single-blind (investigator) controlled trial design was used. The study was conducted in Jimma, South West Ethiopia. Using computer-generated codes, eligible children of 3-59 months in age were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 39) and control (n = 39) groups at a 1:1 ratio. Children in the intervention group received home-based play-assisted stimulation in addition to the basic services provided to children in both groups. The intervention consisted of an hour of play stimulation conducted during a weekly home visit over the course of six months. Personal-social, language, fine and gross motor outcomes were assessed using Denver II-Jimma, and social-emotional outcome was obtained using an adapted Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ: SE). Information about sociodemographic characteristics was collected using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric methods were used to determine nutritional status. The effects of the intervention on the abovementioned outcomes over the study period and group differences in change over time were examined using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). RESULTS: Statistically significant intervention effects were found for language (P = 0.0014), personal-social (P = 0.0087) and social-emotional (P < 0.0001) performances. At the midline of the study, language (effect size = 0.34) and social-emotional (effect size = - 0.603) benefits from the play-assisted stimulation had already been observed for the children in the intervention group. For language, the intervention effect depended on the child's sex (P = 0.0100) and for personal-social performance, on family income (P = 0.0300). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive home-based play-assisted stimulation reduced the developmental problems of children in foster families in the context of extreme poverty. Longer follow-up may reveal further improvements in the developmental performance of the children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov on 17 November 2016, Study Identifier: NCT02988180 .","Comments":"This study falls under the EY Play-based learning strand.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Worku Berhanu Nigussie; Abessa Teklu Gemechu; Wondafrash Mekitie ; Lemmens Johan ; Valy Jan ; Bruckers Liesbeth ; Kolsteren Patrick ; Granitzer Marita ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-018-1023-0","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\neppi-reviewer4\r\n*Child Development\r\nChild Language\r\nChild, Preschool\r\n*Early Intervention, Educational/mt [Methods]\r\nEthiopia\r\nFemale\r\n*House Calls\r\nHumans\r\nInfant\r\nMale\r\nMother-Child Relations\r\nMotor Skills\r\n*Play and Playthings\r\n*Poverty\r\nSingle-Blind Method\r\nSocial Skills","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Worku Berhanu Nigussie, Abessa Teklu Gemechu, Wondafrash Mekitie, Lemmens Johan, Valy Jan, Bruckers Liesbeth, Kolsteren Patrick, and Granitzer Marita (2018) Effects of home-based play-assisted stimulation on developmental performances of children living in extreme poverty: A randomized single-blind controlled trial.
