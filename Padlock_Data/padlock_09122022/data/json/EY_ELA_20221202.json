Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\r\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools). Peers will normally be of similar age and socio-economic or cultural background.\r\rUniversity students tutoring primary school pupils would not usually be classified as 'peers'.","AttributeType":"Not

study investigated the effects of an intervention which capitalized on the natural tendency of non-reading kindergarten students to engage in invented spelling in order to teach them the alphabetic principle upon which our written language is based. All 96 participants were non-reading kindergarten students. The experimental group was composed of 38 students who received explicit phonological based training and scaffolded instructional support in invented spelling in the regular classroom three times per week over 14 weeks. The control group consisted of 33 students who were given opportunity and encouragement to spell inventively, but without explicit training and instructional support. A comparison group was formed of 25 students who were given neither opportunity nor encouragement to spell inventively. The results of this study indicate that explicit phonological process based training and scaffolded instructional support linked to invented spelling strengthen phonemic segmentation ability and letter-sound knowledge, two of the foundational skills and concepts upon which early literacy development is based. It also resulted in students' accelerated progress through the developmental stages of invented spelling and increased ability to read phonetically regular words. This study does not support the assumption that these effects will occur by merely creating an environment in which invented spelling is encouraged and practiced regularly. Although explicit instruction based on phonological processes was shown to be advantageous for both developmentally high and low students, it was especially beneficial for students initially demonstrating developmentally low levels of literacy acquisition.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 arms in this study: a) experimental group (trained inventive spellers), b) control group (encouraged inventive spellers, and c) comparison group (conventional spellers).

study investigated the effects of an intervention which capitalized on the natural tendency of non-reading kindergarten students to engage in invented spelling in order to teach them the alphabetic principle upon which our written language is based. All 96 participants were non-reading kindergarten students. The experimental group was composed of 38 students who received explicit phonological based training and scaffolded instructional support in invented spelling in the regular classroom three times per week over 14 weeks. The control group consisted of 33 students who were given opportunity and encouragement to spell inventively, but without explicit training and instructional support. A comparison group was formed of 25 students who were given neither opportunity nor encouragement to spell inventively. The results of this study indicate that explicit phonological process based training and scaffolded instructional support linked to invented spelling strengthen phonemic segmentation ability and letter-sound knowledge, two of the foundational skills and concepts upon which early literacy development is based. It also resulted in students' accelerated progress through the developmental stages of invented spelling and increased ability to read phonetically regular words. This study does not support the assumption that these effects will occur by merely creating an environment in which invented spelling is encouraged and practiced regularly. Although explicit instruction based on phonological processes was shown to be advantageous for both developmentally high and low students, it was especially beneficial for students initially demonstrating developmentally low levels of literacy acquisition.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 arms in this study: a) experimental group (trained inventive spellers), b) control group (encouraged inventive spellers, and c) comparison group (conventional spellers).

Seventy-one preschoolers aged 3–5 from a low SES township in central Israel (35 in the reading program and 36 in the writing program) participated in evaluation of the interventions. Twenty-four untreated preschoolers served as a control group. The children were tested twice, at the beginning and at the end of the school year, in: phonological awareness, word writing, letter knowledge, orthographic awareness, listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, and general knowledge. Both programs involved games and creative activities. The writing program encouraged letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and functional writing activities. The reading program utilized 11 children's books for focusing on language and exploring major concepts raised by these books. Results indicated that children in the two literacy programs progressed significantly more than the control group on phonological awareness and orthographic awareness. However, the joint writing group significantly outperformed both the joint reading group and the control group on phonological awareness, word writing, orthographic awareness, and letter knowledge. We also found that children as young as 3–4 years gained from literacy programs as much as did older children, aged 4–5, on all the measures assessed in our program.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: Joint Reading, Joint Writing and control.

Seventy-one preschoolers aged 3–5 from a low SES township in central Israel (35 in the reading program and 36 in the writing program) participated in evaluation of the interventions. Twenty-four untreated preschoolers served as a control group. The children were tested twice, at the beginning and at the end of the school year, in: phonological awareness, word writing, letter knowledge, orthographic awareness, listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, and general knowledge. Both programs involved games and creative activities. The writing program encouraged letter knowledge, phonological awareness, and functional writing activities. The reading program utilized 11 children's books for focusing on language and exploring major concepts raised by these books. Results indicated that children in the two literacy programs progressed significantly more than the control group on phonological awareness and orthographic awareness. However, the joint writing group significantly outperformed both the joint reading group and the control group on phonological awareness, word writing, orthographic awareness, and letter knowledge. We also found that children as young as 3–4 years gained from literacy programs as much as did older children, aged 4–5, on all the measures assessed in our program.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: Joint Reading, Joint Writing and control.

Ninety students from three urban public schools in the U. S. were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first group received training in segmenting words into phonemes, as well as training in correspondences between letter names and letter sounds (phoneme awareness group). The second group received only the training in letter names and letter sounds (language activities group). The third group received no intervention (control group). Results indicated that phoneme awareness instruction, combined with instruction connecting the phonemic segments to alphabet letters, significantly improved the early reading and spelling skills of the children in the phoneme awareness group. However, instruction in letter names and letter sounds alone did not significantly improve the segmentation skills, the early reading skills, or the spelling skills of the kindergarten children who participated in the language activities group, as compared with the control group.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: a) phoneme segmentation group; b) language activities group (control group I); and c) no intervention (control group II).

Ninety students from three urban public schools in the U. S. were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first group received training in segmenting words into phonemes, as well as training in correspondences between letter names and letter sounds (phoneme awareness group). The second group received only the training in letter names and letter sounds (language activities group). The third group received no intervention (control group). Results indicated that phoneme awareness instruction, combined with instruction connecting the phonemic segments to alphabet letters, significantly improved the early reading and spelling skills of the children in the phoneme awareness group.

The \ndependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological \nawareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills \n(DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to \nassign students to program or nonprogram status.\nResults of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. \nThese treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the \ninitial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the \nDIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. \nProgram gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and \nduration of the independent variable. Additionally, students’ scores increased 3.3 \npoints on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these \nscores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that \nthe program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in \nprogram evaluation.\nThis study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with \nprekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for \nearly identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided \ndata concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically \nphonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Beach D W; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Beach D W (2004) The effects of a school district's kindergarten readiness summer program on phonological awareness skills of at -risk prekindergarten students: A regression discontinuity analysis. , Utah State University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215240,"AdditionalText":"There are 3 groups: Letter, Shape and Control.

whether tracing letters is a worthwhile technique for learning the connections between letters and their corresponding sounds. 36 White children (aged 4–6 yrs) were divided into 3 groups. In 3-wk training sessions, Group 1 pronounced letters while tracing them, and Group 2 pronounced letters while watching them be traced. Group 3 acted as a control group. All Ss completed pretests and posttests. In a letter–sound test, the training groups did not differ from each other, but both differed significantly from the control group. A sound–letter test showed improvement only in the group that watched letters being traced. Letter–sound skills can be improved at the prereading stage. However, tracing letters on a computer screen does not appear to confer any extra benefits and may even be a slight distraction.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: Letter, Shape and Control.

whether tracing letters is a worthwhile technique for learning the connections between letters and their corresponding sounds. 36 White children (aged 4–6 yrs) were divided into 3 groups. In 3-wk training sessions, Group 1 pronounced letters while tracing them, and Group 2 pronounced letters while watching them be traced. Group 3 acted as a control group. All Ss completed pretests and posttests. In a letter–sound test, the training groups did not differ from each other, but both differed significantly from the control group. A sound–letter test showed improvement only in the group that watched letters being traced. Letter–sound skills can be improved at the prereading stage. However, tracing letters on a computer screen does not appear to confer any extra benefits and may even be a slight distraction.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: Letter, Shape and Control.

The intervention involved brief lessons, “hands-on” extension activities, and specific teaching strategies linked empirically with the promotion of: (a) social-emotional competencies and (b) language development and emergent literacy skills. Take-home materials were provided to parents to enhance skill development at home. Multimethod assessments of three hundred and fifty-six 4-year-old children tracked their progress over the course of the 1-year program. Results revealed significant differences favoring children in the enriched intervention classrooms on measures of vocabulary, emergent literacy, emotional understanding, social problem solving, social behavior, and learning engagement. Implications are discussed for developmental models of school readiness and for early educational programs and policies.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bierman Karen L; Domitrovich Celene E; Nix Robert L; Gest Scott D; Welsh Janet A; Greenberg Mark T; Blair Clancy ; Nelson Keith E; Gill Sukhdeep ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01227.x","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bierman Karen L, Domitrovich Celene E, Nix Robert L, Gest Scott D, Welsh Janet A, Greenberg Mark T, Blair Clancy, Nelson Keith E, and Gill Sukhdeep (2008) Promoting academic and social‐emotional school readiness: The Head Start REDI program.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of instruction in phonological awareness provided in low-income, inner-city kindergarten classrooms by kindergarten teachers and their teaching assistants. Prior to the intervention, the 84 treatment children and 75 control children, who attended inner-city schools in an urban district in upstate New York, did not differ on age, sex, race, SES, PPVT-R score, phoneme segmentation, letter name knowledge, letter sound knowledge, or reading. After the 11 week intervention, the treatment children significantly outperformed the control children on measures of phoneme segmentation, letter name and letter sound knowledge, two of three reading measures, and a measure of invented spelling. Implications for improving beginning reading instruction are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Blachman B A; Ball E W; Black R S; Tangel D M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01027275","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Blachman B A, Ball E W, Black R S, and Tangel D M (1994) Kindergarten teachers develop phoneme awareness in low-income, inner-city classrooms.

children acquire new vocabulary at an amazing rate during the first five years of life. Because there is a strong relationship between language development during the early years and reading ability in the primary grades, early childhood teachers must understand language and literacy development. Children enter kindergarten in the United States with large differences in their background knowledge, vocabulary, and early literacy experiences. It is essential that early childhood programs provide quality language experiences such as read-alouds in order for children to become successful readers.\n\nThis study examined the strategy of using nonfiction interactive book read-alouds with the emergent reader in preschool to promote vocabulary development. In this quantitative study, 53 three-, four-, and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program were participants. The preschool children were assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT) as pre and posttests. The researcher read nonfiction literature to one class and fictional text to another twice per week for 12 weeks but did not read to the control group. Standardized test scores did not show significant differences in the post-test scores among the control and the two treatment groups, although all groups showed improvement in their receptive and expressive vocabularies.\n\nIn addition, a survey designed by the researcher was sent out to preschool teachers and childcare providers about the amount of time they read aloud to children, the amount of time they spend reading fiction compared to nonfiction text, and their years of teaching in early childhood and educational backgrounds. Results showed that teachers in early childhood programs are reading to children an average of 8.5 out of 10 days, although nonfiction literature is not being read to young children as much as fiction.\n\nThe findings in this report have implications for practice in the field. Because vocabulary development is a key ingredient in the learning-to-read process, teachers and parents can use nonfiction as a tool, if they are aware of the benefits of how to use this genre to support children's emerging literacy skills.","Comments":"ESDE: Please combine the Fiction and Non-fiction groups versus control. EVT as the Toolkit primary outcome, PPVT as a secondary outcome. Please also enter the EVT and PPVT groups separately as an additional secondary outcome and label the outcome accordingly.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Bortnem G M; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bortnem G M (2005) The effects of using non-fiction interactive read -alouds on expressive and receptive vocabulary of preschool children. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":847045,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"International Journal of Behavioral Development · March 2011[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Borzekowski & Henry_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5372848,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":847045,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Pandeglang District in Indonesia’s\nBanten Province.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Borzekowski & Henry_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":847045,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"participants came\nfrom three main locations (Munjul, Kota Dukuh, and Gunung Batu\nvillage) from the Munjul subdistrict (Pandeglang District in Indone-\nsia’s Banten Province).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Borzekowski & Henry_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215328,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":847045,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Jalan Sesama[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Borzekowski & Henry_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215411,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":847045,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"Indonesian children ages 3 to 6 years[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Borzekowski & Henry_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"160","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":847045,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"160 children[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Borzekowski & Henry_2009.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":847045,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"At baseline, researchers inter-\nviewed 160 children and 160 parents.

Sesama was developed to address the developmental needs of Indonesian children ages 3 to 6 years. Using a randomized experimental research study design, this study examined the effect of a 14-week intervention on 160 children in the Pandeglang District in Indonesia’s Banten Province. Results offer solid evidence that early cognitive skills, literacy, mathematics, health and safety knowledge, social development, environmental awareness, and cultural awareness significantly improved from baseline to post-intervention. Those with the greatest exposure to Jalan Sesama performed the best, even after controlling for baseline scores, gender, age, and parents’ education.

Twenty-seven Head Start children, ages 3 to 5, and their parents/caregivers participated in the study. An experimental-control group design to investigate the effectiveness of the intervention and the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening for Preschoolers (PALS-PreK) was used as a pre and post-test assessment. Results indicated there were no significant interactions of the intervention and children's scores for the intact groups. There were also no significant changes in parent behaviors and attitudes toward reading, as measured by a family reading survey, as a result of the intervention. During post hoc analyses, an age effect was investigated and results indicated 4-year-old children in the intervention group scored significantly higher than 4-year-old children in the control group. In addition, 4- and 5-year-old children in the intervention group also made significant gains on the print awareness subtest of the PALS-PreK. Anecdotal changes in parent and children behavior as a result of the intervention are also reported. Recommendations include expanding parent-child literacy activities from shared story-book reading and addressing attrition problems in studies with families from impoverished backgrounds.","Comments":"Coders: Please use combined scores for 3, 4 and 5 year-old, experimental vs. control.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Boyle Elizabeth A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Boyle Elizabeth A (2006) The effects of a parent-child early literacy intervention on children's phonemic awareness and preliteracy skills. , The Johns Hopkins University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":734476,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"The general goals, on which the daily lessons were based, were the\nfollowing:\n1.

These 13 children comprised the experimental group, while 12 other children were used as a control group. The ages of the children ranged from 3 years, 3 months to 5 years, 10 months. The average age of the experimental group was less than that of the control group. The experimental group was divided into three groups on the basis of language ability. The language program required the children to describe things, listen to the language models of the teacher, and imitate those models. Pretests administered at the beginning of the 5-month program were (1) the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA), (2) the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and (3) the Irwin Articulation Test. Only the ITPA and PPVT were given as posttests. The scores of the experimental and control groups on the ITPA and PPVT did not differ significantly except on two subtests of the ITPA, both of which tested grammar skills. Thus, it was concluded that the language progra did produce some gain in the language ability of the experimental group. It was also found that the most able children at the beginning of the program benefited the most from the program.

This added up to a total training\ntime of 5 hr for each group. The third group in each school (unseen\ncontrol) was not given any teaching by the researcher. This group\nwas only given pretests and posttests. Lessons for each group were\nrehearsed with another group of children outside the experiment to\nensure that our presentation of the lessons would run smoothly. We\nopened each lesson with an overview of the lesson content and a\nrevision of previous learning. The aims for the lesson were also\nreviewed at the close of the lesson.\nThe phonemic training group focused on segmentation and\nblending skills. These often revolved around a target word that was\nembedded within a short, easy-to-recall rhyme or jingle. However,\nto control for the effect of the reading rhymes, we also had the\nalternative training control group read these rhymes.\nThe skills taught during phonemic training included alliteration\n(e.g., big, bad, bug) and rhyme (e.g., fat, rat). Segmentation\nactivities involved using the Elkonin technique (Clay, 1985),\nwherein children place tokens into squares that represent the\nphonemic structure of words. Other activities involved games,\nwhere children had to decide which picture cards started the same,\nended the same, or had the same middle sound. Children were also\ntaught to blend sounds (e.g., mmooo = moo) and how to delete\nsounds (e.g., meat without the m says eat). The program was\nadapted in part from that described by Williams (1979, 1980) with\n7 consonants (b, c, g, m, p, s, t) and two short vowels (o, a) selected\nfor initial training. We selected these to avoid visual and auditory\nconfusability. Also, they produced a high number of consonant-\nvowel-consonant (CVC) real words, and they showed regularity\nof phonemes in spelling patterns.

the present study the effect of providing phonemic awareness instruction, at school entry, on the reading and spelling progress of 5-yr-old children was examined within a whole language program. In Exp 1, which focused on spelling acquisition, 15 children received phonemic awareness training twice weekly, each time for 20 min, over a 10-wk period, while another group of 15 children was involved in \"process writing.\" In Exp 2, which focused on reading acquisition, 17 children received phonemic awareness training while a 2nd matched group of 17 children participated in other language and reading activities that did not involve phonemic instruction, and a 3rd matched group of 17 children received no extra instruction at all. Overall, the training in the 2 experiments had significant effects on spelling and reading performance.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code for experiment 2, Phonemic (intervention) versus Unseen (control).

current study was designed to assess the vocabulary and literacy skills of young children who participated in an authentic literacy practice, i.e., Vivian Paley's “storytelling curriculum,” over the course of their respective prekindergarten or kindergarten years. We asked: How do prekindergarten and kindergarten age children, who participate in the storytelling curriculum over the course of the school year, perform on pre- and postmeasures of AGS/Pearson Assessments' Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT), the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) (3rd ed.) Form IIIA, and Whitehurst's Get Ready to Read!, as compared to those young children in the same grade with similar backgrounds and in the same or similar school settings who did not participate in the storytelling curriculum? Results show that in comparison to same-age children in like settings, participants in the storytelling curriculum showed significant gains in both vocabulary knowledge and literacy skills. These findings underscore the possibility of supporting both beginning and experienced teachers in using authentic literacy activities to prepare children for literacy learning, while maintaining their service to a wide range of other developmental issues. They also call into question the prevailing trend to abandon such classroom practices in favor of a skills-centered approach to curriculum.","Comments":"Copyright National Association of Early Childhood Teacher Educators","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cooper Patricia M; Capo Karen ; Mathes Bernie ; Gray Lincoln ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10901020701555564","Keywords":"world","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cooper Patricia M, Capo Karen, Mathes Bernie, and Gray Lincoln (2007) One authentic early literacy practice and three standardized tests: Can a storytelling curriculum measure up?.

Results indicated no main effects for the experimental curriculum. Following the initial analyses, fidelity of implementation in the experimental classrooms was examined and results indicated that children in classrooms rated as having high fidelity of implementation significantly outperformed low-implementing classrooms on two important phonological awareness measures. This trend favoring high-implementing classrooms was also evident on measures of letter-name knowledge, and beginning sounds. These findings suggest that program implementation may be a significant variable when examining the potential effects of literacy curricula on learning outcomes for young at-risk children.","Comments":"ESDE: Use the t-tests from the HLM results in Table 4 for the whole sample intervention v control and the Campbell Calculator (t-test unequal sample sizes (14/13).

Having uneven numbers of\nschools with one and/or multiple number of classes would mean there is a higher probability that treatment or control\ngroups would be unequal in terms of size.\nTo deal with unequal treatment fractions we used the command randtreat and the option misfits(global)in\nStata (Carril, 2017).

NELI is published by Oxford University Press and was delivered in this trial by the University of Oxford in partnership with Elklan. The 20-week intervention consists of two 15-minute individual sessions and three 30-minute small group sessions each week. The children selected to participate in this trial were the five children in each classroom who obtained the lowest scores on a school-administered app-based assessment of oral language skills (LanguageScreen).The programme focuses on developing children’s narrative, vocabulary, and listening skills, while phonological awareness and letter sound knowledge are also developed during the second half of the programme. Training includes an initial two-day course for TAs followed by a half-day workshop half-way through the programme in addition to ongoing online support. Teachers also receive an initial half-day of training so that they can understand the programme and support TAs. This project was a randomised controlled trial; 193 schools participated, 97 of which received the programme while 96 did not, the latter forming the control group. The process evaluation involved observations of the training, surveys with school staff, case studies in six schools (which used interviews with school staff), and analyses of TA training logs and online resource use.

The intervention consisted of two main components: (1) picture book reading and (2) phonemic awareness training. Children who experienced the literacy intervention were compared to those randomly assigned to a control condition who received the normal Head Start curriculum. Multiple aspects of emergent literacy were assessed at the beginning and end of the school year. ANCOVA's revealed that the emergent literacy intervention used in this study was highly effective at producing greater emergent literacy skills in children exposed to the intervention, particularly on skills related to letter and sound knowledge, print knowledge, and emergent writing. Because knowledge of alphabetic principles is necessary before learning more advanced literacy skills, the intervention used in this study was successful at increasing the skills that Head Start children need most before entering formal schooling.","Comments":"Please use the OCR version for highlighting in data extraction.

Following training, teachers in the 2 treatment groups conducted the treatments for about 20 wks. In each teacher's class, pre- and posttreatment data were collected on 12–14 children (N = 404); 312 children were tested again the following fall. At the end of kindergarten, the 2 treatment groups performed comparably and outperformed controls on the phonological awareness measures. On alphabetic (reading and spelling) tasks, however, the group participating in phonological awareness training with beginning decoding instruction did better than the other 2 groups. In the fall of the next year, many of these between-group differences remained but were less impressive. Implications are discussed for bridging research and practice.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: a) Ladders, b) Ladders + PALS and c) control. Please code a) vs c).

Following training, teachers in the 2 treatment groups conducted the treatments for about 20 wks. In each teacher's class, pre- and posttreatment data were collected on 12–14 children (N = 404); 312 children were tested again the following fall. At the end of kindergarten, the 2 treatment groups performed comparably and outperformed controls on the phonological awareness measures. On alphabetic (reading and spelling) tasks, however, the group participating in phonological awareness training with beginning decoding instruction did better than the other 2 groups. In the fall of the next year, many of these between-group differences remained but were less impressive. Implications are discussed for bridging research and practice.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: a) Ladders, b) Ladders + PALS and c) control. Please code b) vs c).

article describes the design and implementation of a program that incorporates a response-to-intervention (RTI) framework for promoting the development of early literacy and language skills among low-income minority children. The early literacy program, called the Exemplary Model of Early Reading Growth and Excellence, or EMERGE, combines classroom practices that are grounded in empirical research, a multitiered intervention hierarchy, high-quality professional development, and continuous progress monitoring to help children in Head Start classrooms acquire early literacy competencies to prepare them for later success in school. Preliminary program evaluation data are presented, and challenges associated with applying an RTI model in early childhood education are addressed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gettinger Maribeth ; Stoiber Karen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0271121407311238","Keywords":"early literacy\r\nresponse-to-intervention\r\nprogress monitoring\r\nmultitiered instruction\r\nHead Start\r\nSage CA: Los Angeles, CA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gettinger Maribeth, and Stoiber Karen (2008) Applying a response-to-intervention model for early literacy development in low-income children.

The first steps toward reading literacy begin in early childhood. The components of early literacy skills include oral language, phonological awareness, and print knowledge. Strong early literacy skills are crucial to later reading competency. One group of children, those with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, are particularly vulnerable to reading failure. It is possible that their struggles begin with early literacy skills. To date, researchers have yet to explore the effects of an early literacy intervention on the development of oral language skills, phonological awareness, and print knowledge in young children with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of intervention on the early literacy growth rates of young children with symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity. Specifically, this study addressed whether an intervention would lead to increases on measures of oral language, phonological awareness, and print knowledge. Participants in this study included 28 preschool children between 3 and 5 years of age. Fourteen children were in the treatment group and 14 children were in the comparison group. Every child was teacher nominated as having significantly more symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity as compared to peers. In addition, each child had a significant score on the Conners ’ Teacher Rating Scale - Revised: Short Form. The children in the treatment group participated in the early literacy intervention, based on the published curriculum Ladders to Literacy, 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week, for 6 weeks. Children in both the treatment and comparison groups participated in weekly individual assessments. The assessments included one oral language task, three phonological awareness tasks (Alliteration, Rhyming, and Segment Blending), and one print knowledge task (Letter Naming). Results indicated that the children in the treatment group scored significantly higher on the print knowledge measure (Letter Naming). On average, the children in the treatment group learned one letter more a week than the children in the comparison group.

Treatment children (n=42) received both analytic and synthetic phonemic awareness computer-assisted instruction, while controls (n=34) received no special training. Mean age of participants was approximately 5 years 7 months. Pretests included initial phonemic awareness, letter knowledge, word-level reading, invented spelling, vocabulary knowledge, and print concepts. Spelling skills emerged as the best consistent predictor of variability in phonemic awareness in response to instruction. We propose that relations between phonemic awareness and spelling skills are bidirectional: Spelling influenced growth in phonemic awareness and phonemic awareness contributed to growth in spelling skills. The amount of exposure that children had to the treatment intervention contributed uniquely to individual differences in posttest levels of phonemic awareness and spelling.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hecht Steven A; Close Linda ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0965(02)00001-2","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hecht Steven A, and Close Linda (2002) Emergent literacy skills and training time uniquely predict variability in responses to phonemic awareness training in disadvantaged kindergartners.

printed and verbal, is crucial to the development of children's knowledge of narrative structure and the resulting story grammars that help them understand the texts they read. The primary questions this research aimed to answer were whether video viewing of narratives could lead to positive changes in narrative comprehension, and whether retelling could be a tool to enhance those positive changes. The study tested preschool children's narrative comprehension before and after completing a 10-day intervention involving daily interaction with narratives in either storybook or video format and, for a subset, daily retelling practice. Sixty-three 4- and 5-year-old children took part in a 10-day narrative intervention involving an initial interaction with either a print or video medium and a second experience consisting of either retelling or a repeated narrative experience. Ten additional children comprised a no-treatment control group. Results showed that interactions with both video and print narratives enhanced children's narrative comprehension, and that when children actively engaged in daily retelling practice these benefits were enhanced.","Comments":"Coders: Please use scores from Table 6 comparing the intervention vs. no-treatment groups.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Irlen Sandra Michelle; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education\r\nNarrative comprehension\r\nPreliterate\r\nRetelling\r\nVideo viewing","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Irlen Sandra Michelle (2003) The impact of video viewing and retelling on preliterate children's narrative comprehension. , University of California."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":734624,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"HeadsUp!

Reading (HUR), a professional development literacy workshop series, with and without supplementary mentoring on early childhood educators’ (ECEs) practices and its subsequent effect on preschool children's literacy skills. ECEs who served children in high poverty communities participated in a 15-week satellite broadcast training series. Pre- and post-assessments were completed for both the control and intervention groups. Participants in HUR and HUR+mentoring significantly exceeded the control ECEs on the quality of their classroom environments. Children's literacy skills improved more in the HUR classrooms than in control classrooms. Mentoring did not enhance preschool children's literacy skills more than HUR alone. The treatment was equally effective for Spanish- and English-speaking children. Early childhood educator participation in HeadsUp! Reading can enhance the effectiveness of classroom literacy practices and has subsequent benefits on language and literacy skills of preschool children from poverty backgrounds. These findings further support the crucial role of high quality programs for the development of children's literacy skills.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: a) HeadsUp!

Thirty-six children, ages three to five, attending a day care center serving a minority, racial group in a low-economic area were randomly placed into three treatment groups and one control group. All of the subjects were administered three pre-tests and three post-tests. For ten weeks the researcher met with the three treatment groups on a daily basis. Groups One and Two heard the same stories, the difference between the groups being the amount of language interaction initiated by the researcher. Group Three worked freely with art materials. The effect of the reading aloud, language interaction and the interaction of the two were each addressed by the three post-tests. Analysis of covariance was used to measure differences, the covariates being the three pre-tests and ages of the subjects. There were no statistically significant results from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or Development of Oral Language test. The results from the Concepts About Print test did show a statistically significant effect from reading aloud. Results from the Concepts About Print test did not show statistically significant effects for language interaction or the combination of reading aloud and language interaction, however. Subsequent analysis of the means and standard deviations for each of the four groups, on each of the post-tests, plus a look at the gains and losses made by the subjects from the pre-tests to the post-tests did provide some interesting insight into possible reasons for the lack of significance in this study.

Thirty-six children, ages three to five, attending a day care center serving a minority, racial group in a low-economic area were randomly placed into three treatment groups and one control group. All of the subjects were administered three pre-tests and three post-tests. For ten weeks the researcher met with the three treatment groups on a daily basis. Groups One and Two heard the same stories, the difference between the groups being the amount of language interaction initiated by the researcher. Group Three worked freely with art materials. The effect of the reading aloud, language interaction and the interaction of the two were each addressed by the three post-tests. Analysis of covariance was used to measure differences, the covariates being the three pre-tests and ages of the subjects. There were no statistically significant results from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or Development of Oral Language test. The results from the Concepts About Print test did show a statistically significant effect from reading aloud. Results from the Concepts About Print test did not show statistically significant effects for language interaction or the combination of reading aloud and language interaction, however. Subsequent analysis of the means and standard deviations for each of the four groups, on each of the post-tests, plus a look at the gains and losses made by the subjects from the pre-tests to the post-tests did provide some interesting insight into possible reasons for the lack of significance in this study. Some possible variables examined were: group dynamics, actual language interaction occurrences, size of groups, age variations in groups, length of study, and physical setting and situation.","Comments":"Coders: There are 4 groups: Group One: Read-aloud with language interaction, Group 2: Read-aloud with no interaction, Group 3: Interaction group with no read-aloud program, Group 4: No interaction or read-aloud group (control).

report summarizes findings from Project Upgrade, one of four experiments conducted as part of the Evaluation of Child Care Subsidy Strategies. Recognizing the need for information that would help states and communities allocate their child care subsidy funds as effectively as possible, the Child Care Bureau and the Office for Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) of the Administration for Children and Families within the US Department of Health and Human Services launched this major study in 2001. The study is being conducted by Abt Associates Inc, with its research partners MDRC and the National Center for Children in Poverty of Columbia University. The evaluation is a multi-site, multi-year effort to determine whether and how different child care subsidy policies and procedures and quality improvement efforts help low-income parents obtain and hold onto jobs and improve outcomes for children. Study staff worked with states and communities across the country to identify significant issues and develop hypotheses about the use of child care subsidy funds that could be rigorously tested in a series of experiments. A guiding principle of the study was that state (or community) interests and preferences should play a large role in the choice of research topics and strategies. The funds that flow to states through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), administered at the federal level by the Child Care Bureau have two purposes. The major portion of the funds provides subsidies for child care for children of low-income working parents whose eligibility is determined by states within broad federal guidelines. A small percentage of the funds (4%) is set aside, with state matching funds, to improve the quality of child care for all children. It was the expressed intention of the Child Care Bureau that the study generate a set of experiments that examined aspects of the use of both types of funds. While some states expressed interest in testing some alternative policies governing the use of direct service dollars, many more were concerned about the effectiveness of their current use of funds intended to improve child care quality. Ultimately, study staff working closely with state and local staff, implemented four experiments, two that are testing alternative subsidy policies and two that test approaches to the use of quality set-aside funds. Project Upgrade in Miami-Dade County falls into the latter group of experiments.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 interventions: Treatment 1: Ready, Set, Leap; Treatment 2, Building Early Language and Literacy; Treatment 3, Breakthrough to Literacy.

students were selected for participation in a reading intervention program on the basis of their ability to name the letters of the alphabet. The intervention consisted of 1:2 tutoring for 30 minutes per day for two 10-week periods using an interactive strategies approach that emphasized direct instruction in the alphabetic principle, phonemic awareness, analyzing words, learning sight words and reading connected text. A treatment group consistently outperformed a “waiting group” control, which also showed accelerated progress upon receiving the intervention. A two year longitudinal follow up of this kindergarten cohort indicated lower rates of placement in special education.","Comments":"Coders: Children were split into Low and high scoring groups on letter naming.

The children entered the program with oral language skills that were significantly below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (a) no treatment control, (b) a school condition in which children were read to by their teachers in small groups, (c) a home condition in which children were read to by their parents, and (d) a combined school plus home condition. Parents and teachers were trained in a specific form of interactive reading via an instructional videotape. The intervention was conducted for 6 weeks, after which children were posttested on standardized measures of oral language, and language samples were obtained during a shared-reading assessment. Significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and were largest for children in conditions involving home reading.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 4 groups: (a) school condition (b) home condition  (c)  combined school plus home (d) no treatment control.

Language skills of the children were below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) no-treatment control, (b) typical shared-reading condition, and (c) dialogic (interactive) shared-reading condition. For both intervention conditions, undergraduate volunteers read to children in small groups. Following the 6-week intervention, children were posttested on measures of oral language, listening comprehension, and phonological sensitivity. Both interventions produced positive effects. Results favoring dialogic reading were found on a measure of descriptive use of language, whereas results favoring typical shared-reading were found on measures of listening comprehension and alliteration detection.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: (a) typical shared-reading condition, (b) dialogic (interactive) shared-reading condition, (c) no-treatment control.

Language skills of the children were below age-level as measured by standardized tests. Children were pretested and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) no-treatment control, (b) typical shared-reading condition, and (c) dialogic (interactive) shared-reading condition. For both intervention conditions, undergraduate volunteers read to children in small groups. Following the 6-week intervention, children were posttested on measures of oral language, listening comprehension, and phonological sensitivity. Both interventions produced positive effects. Results favoring dialogic reading were found on a measure of descriptive use of language, whereas results favoring typical shared-reading were found on measures of listening comprehension and alliteration detection.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: (a) typical shared-reading condition, (b) dialogic (interactive) shared-reading condition, (c) no-treatment control.

This study evaluated the use of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) to provide training in phonological sensitivity skills to preschoolers at-risk for reading problems. Forty-five children ranging in age from 44 to 64 months (M = 55.1, SD = 6.07) were randomly assigned to a CAI group or a control group. Children exposed to CAI made significantly greater gains on rhyming and elision skills compared to the control group. Expressive vocabulary scores were predictive of pre- to posttest growth. Children in the CAI condition positively rated participation in the training program. Results provide preliminary support for CAI to improve the phonological sensitivity skills of preschoolers who are at-risk.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lonigan Christopher J; Driscoll Kimberly ; Phillips Beth M; Cantor Brenlee G; Anthony Jason L; Goldstein Howard ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/105381510302500402","Keywords":"Sage CA: Thousand Oaks, CA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lonigan Christopher J, Driscoll Kimberly, Phillips Beth M, Cantor Brenlee G, Anthony Jason L, and Goldstein Howard (2003) A computer-assisted instruction phonological sensitivity program for preschool children at-risk for reading problems.

In this cluster-randomized study, we evaluated the impacts of a literacy-focused preschool curriculum and two types of professional development on the emergent literacy skills of preschool children at-risk for educational difficulties. Forty-eight preschools were randomly assigned to a business-as-usual control, a literacy-focused curriculum with workshop-only professional development, or a literacy-focused curriculum with workshop plus in-class mentoring professional development conditions.

In this cluster-randomized study, we evaluated the impacts of a literacy-focused preschool curriculum and two types of professional development on the emergent literacy skills of preschool children at-risk for educational difficulties. Forty-eight preschools were randomly assigned to a business-as-usual control, a literacy-focused curriculum with workshop-only professional development, or a literacy-focused curriculum with workshop plus in-class mentoring professional development conditions. An ethnically diverse group of 739 preschool children was assessed on language and literacy outcomes.

In this cluster-randomized study, we evaluated the impacts of a literacy-focused preschool curriculum and two types of professional development on the emergent literacy skills of preschool children at-risk for educational difficulties. Forty-eight preschools were randomly assigned to a business-as-usual control, a literacy-focused curriculum with workshop-only professional development, or a literacy-focused curriculum with workshop plus in-class mentoring professional development conditions. An ethnically diverse group of 739 preschool children was assessed on language and literacy outcomes. Results revealed significant and moderate effects for the curriculum and small, mostly nonsignificant, effects of professional development across child outcomes and classroom measures.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code Study 3: control vs. mentor group.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lonigan Christopher J; Farver JoAnn M; Phillips Beth M; Clancy-Menchetti Jeanine ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11145-009-9214-6","Keywords":"Language and Literature\nPsycholinguistics\nEducation, general\nNeurology\nLiteracy","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lonigan Christopher J, Farver JoAnn M, Phillips Beth M, and Clancy-Menchetti Jeanine (2011) Promoting the development of preschool children’s emergent literacy skills: A randomized evaluation of a literacy-focused curriculum and two professional development models.

The most recent federal re-authorization of Head Start placed special emphasis on children's emergent literacy skills. This new legislative mandate, as interpreted by the Head Start Bureau in information memoranda (e.g., ACYF-IM-HS-00-03), calls for Head Start grantees and delegate agencies to have enhancement of emergent literacy as a primary program goal, to augment their current self-assessment efforts by creating a system to track patterns of child and program outcomes in emergent literacy, and to use this information to inform program planning and improvement efforts. However, at this time the only readily available measures of preschool children's emergent literacy skills are standardized assessments of academic readiness. These tests can provide information about how a program as a whole is doing (e.g., average performance is at the 40th percentile), and can indicate the relative performance of individual children (e.g., a particular child is at the 30th percentile). However, such information is not particularly useful to teachers and program staff in that it does not indicate in any specific sense what each child knows, what they don't know, and what they should be taught. This project evaluated the use of a Dynamic Assessment system that Head Start teachers used to assess individual preschoolers' emergent literacy skills. Twenty classroom teaching situations were constructed that allowed teachers to emphasize emergent literacy skills while assessing individual children's performance. The Dynamic Assessment was designed to give Head Start teachers an understanding of which of their students have mastery of the materials and which need more work in that particular area while exposing children to literacy materials. In this way, teachers could target areas in which students need the most growth and could tailor experiences to individual students' needs and abilities. We hypothesized that the Dynamic Assessment instrument changed teacher practices and improved children's emergent literacy skills.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Massetti Greta Melania; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Massetti Greta Melania (2002) Dynamic assessment as an intervention for emergent literacy in Head Start. , State University of New York at Stony Brook."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215228,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727258,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 15:\n[¬s]\"adult-interactive behaviors during\nrepeated storybook readings upon the language development and selected\nprereading skills of prekindergarten At Risk students.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Mautte_1990.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727258,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 15:\n[¬s]\"This study examined the effects of adult-interactive behaviors during\nrepeated storybook readings upon the language development and selected\nprereading skills of prekindergarten At Risk students.

A total of 53 inner-city, low socioeconomic status (SES) subjects participated in the 20-week study. Subjects were dichotomized at the median on a measure of development level into average- and delayed-development level groups and were then randomly assigned from each of the two development strata to two experimental groups and to one control group. The subjects in Experimental Group 1 were exposed to adult-interactive behaviors during repeated readings of \"big book\" story-books. Subjects in Experimental Group 2 were exposed to repeated \"big book\" storybook readings without adult interaction. Control group subjects participated in the regular prekindergarten curricular activities. Two separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed on the subjects' scores on the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) and on the Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA). The analysis of the PLS data indicated a significant main effect of treatment (p $<$.0001). Subjects in both experimental groups scored significantly higher than control group subjects, but there was no difference between the two experimental groups. The one-way ANCOVA test for main effects of treatment on the TERA was not statistically significant. Subjects' scores on the PLS and TERA were also subjected to two separate, two-way (development level by treatment) analyses of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVAs confirmed the significant treatment effect on the PLS and nonsignificant treatment effect on the TERA and indicated significant development level effects on both instruments in the expected direction (i.e., average-development level subjects scored significantly higher than delayed-development level subjects). There were no significant interaction effects between development levels and treatments. The results suggested that the language development of low SES prekindergarten students identified as being at risk of academic failure could be enhanced through repeated storybook readings, whether or not the adult who was reading aloud initiated interactive behaviors. Informal observation revealed that the children in Experimental Group 2 generated the interactive behaviors themselves.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: a) story-book reading with adult interaction, b) story-book reading without adult interaction, c) BAU control.

A total of 53 inner-city, low socioeconomic status (SES) subjects participated in the 20-week study. Subjects were dichotomized at the median on a measure of development level into average- and delayed-development level groups and were then randomly assigned from each of the two development strata to two experimental groups and to one control group. The subjects in Experimental Group 1 were exposed to adult-interactive behaviors during repeated readings of \"big book\" story-books. Subjects in Experimental Group 2 were exposed to repeated \"big book\" storybook readings without adult interaction. Control group subjects participated in the regular prekindergarten curricular activities. Two separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed on the subjects' scores on the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) and on the Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA). The analysis of the PLS data indicated a significant main effect of treatment (p $<$.0001). Subjects in both experimental groups scored significantly higher than control group subjects, but there was no difference between the two experimental groups. The one-way ANCOVA test for main effects of treatment on the TERA was not statistically significant. Subjects' scores on the PLS and TERA were also subjected to two separate, two-way (development level by treatment) analyses of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVAs confirmed the significant treatment effect on the PLS and nonsignificant treatment effect on the TERA and indicated significant development level effects on both instruments in the expected direction (i.e., average-development level subjects scored significantly higher than delayed-development level subjects). There were no significant interaction effects between development levels and treatments. The results suggested that the language development of low SES prekindergarten students identified as being at risk of academic failure could be enhanced through repeated storybook readings, whether or not the adult who was reading aloud initiated interactive behaviors. Informal observation revealed that the children in Experimental Group 2 generated the interactive behaviors themselves.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: a) story-book reading with adult interaction, b) story-book reading without adult interaction, c) BAU control.

instruction on children's phonemic awareness were investigated. Participants were thirty-eight parents and their pre-school children. The purpose of this study was to: (1) investigate whether parents could successfully teach phoneme identification skills to preschool children; (2) assess whether the effects of parent-delivered instruction on phonemic awareness and the alphabetic principle could be independent of pretest letter knowledge, child vocabulary and cognitive ability, and SES; (3) determine whether training would generalize to recognition of untrained phonemes; and (4) assess parent satisfaction with the training and instructional program. Children were matched based on vocabulary scores. This measure was also a proxy for SES (Hart & Risley, 1995). Children were then randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups. In addition, pretest letter knowledge was assessed using experimental measures designed by Byrne and Fielding-Barnsley (1991). Parents taught their child to identify initial and ending phonemes and letter-sounds based on the early literacy program Sound Foundations (Byrne & Fielding-Barnsley, 1991), with lesson scripts based on explicit, direct instruction techniques (Kameenui & Carnine,1998; Swanson, Hoskyn & Lee, 1999). The duration of the program was 7 weeks. Children were required to find poster pictures that began or ended with the target sound and to color pictures with the target sound. Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) (Good & Kaminski, 2002) were used to measure Initial Sound Fluency and Letter Naming Fluency. Experimental measures of ending sound fluency, initial phoneme transfer and ending phoneme transfer were also used to measure outcomes. A survey was used to obtain social validity data regarding parent satisfaction with the program. Results indicated that: (a) there was a large, albeit insignificant effect for parent training on children's initial sound fluency (d = 1.1, p < .006); (b) parent training was not predictive of letter naming fluency (p =.07); (c) there were no significant differences on measures of phoneme transfer; and (d) pretest letter knowledge was predictive of outcomes on letter naming fluency (p < .01). Parents reported a high degree of satisfaction with training. The discussion focuses on future research on early literacy instruction and parent-delivered instruction.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"O'Brien Anne Geraldine; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"O'Brien Anne Geraldine (2006) Parent -delivered instruction in phoneme identification: Effects on phonemic awareness and letter knowledge of preschool-aged children. , University of Massachusetts Amherst."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727269,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Ladders to Literacy:[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"O'Connor etal_1996.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215554,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727269,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"fTeacher-Led PhonologicalActivities\"\n\"de-\nlivered byfive classroom teachers[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"O'Connor etal_1996.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727269,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"effects ofactivity-basedphonological instruction de-\nlivered byfive classroom teachers on the phonological skill development and reading and writing\noutcomes[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"O'Connor etal_1996.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":727269,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"teach-\ning classroom teachers to implement phonological\nactivities in their classes and exploring the effects\nthese activities have on children with and without\nmild disabilities or other risk factors.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"O'Connor etal_1996.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215580,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215498,"AdditionalText":"The intervention was the teachers' training on teh erly literacy curriculum, which was the same curriculum used by the control classes too","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727269,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Teachers in the treat-\nment received 10 inservice trainingsessions spaced over the schoolyea[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"O'Connor etal_1996.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":727269,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"Gen-\neral kindergarten teachers received 2 hours of\nparaprofessional assistance weekly[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"O'Connor etal_1996.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":727269,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Teacher training.

Teachers in the treatment received 10 inservice training sessions spaced over the school year and implemented from 100 to 281 activities during the 6-month intervention. Outcomes for treated children were compared with children matched for type (general or repeating kindergartners, or children with mild disabilities) in classrooms using the same background prereading curriculum. Results suggest that intervention delivered by nonresearch personnel can be an effective way to improve the literacy outcomes of children with a broad range of ability.","Comments":"Coders: Please code only General kindergarten; intervention vs control.

Institute of Education Sciences (IES) began the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research (PCER) initiative to conduct rigorous efficacy evaluations of available preschool curricula. Twelve research teams implemented one or two curricula in preschool settings serving predominantly low-income children under an experimental design. For each team, preschools or classrooms were randomly assigned to the intervention curricula or control curricula and the children were followed from pre-kindergarten through kindergarten. IES contracted with RTI International (RTI) and Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) to evaluate the impact of each of the 14 curricula implemented using a common set of measures with the cohort of children beginning preschool in the summer-fall of 2003. This report provides the individual results for each curriculum from the evaluations by RTI and MPR. Chapter 1 describes the PCER initiative and details the common elements of the evaluations including the experimental design, implementation, analysis, results, and findings. Chapters 2-13, respectively, provide greater detail on the individual evaluations of the curricula implemented by each research team including information on the curricula, the demographics of the site-specific samples, assignment, fidelity of implementation, and results. Appendix A presents results from a secondary analysis of the data. Appendix B provides greater detail regarding the data analyses conducted. Appendixes C and D provide additional information regarding the outcome measures.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code Creative Curriculum with Ladders to Literacy vs Creative curriculum only (Chapter 4).","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education, statistics, data, data sets, products, search tools, data access tools, publications, surveys, working papers, ordering information, education indicators, CD-ROMs, elementary/secondary education, postsecondary education, libraries, school locator, education finance, national assessments","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium (2008) Effects of preschool curriculum programs on school readiness: Report from the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research initiative.

Institute of Education Sciences (IES) began the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research (PCER) initiative to conduct rigorous efficacy evaluations of available preschool curricula. Twelve research teams implemented one or two curricula in preschool settings serving predominantly low-income children under an experimental design. For each team, preschools or classrooms were randomly assigned to the intervention curricula or control curricula and the children were followed from pre-kindergarten through kindergarten. IES contracted with RTI International (RTI) and Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) to evaluate the impact of each of the 14 curricula implemented using a common set of measures with the cohort of children beginning preschool in the summer-fall of 2003. This report provides the individual results for each curriculum from the evaluations by RTI and MPR. Chapter 1 describes the PCER initiative and details the common elements of the evaluations including the experimental design, implementation, analysis, results, and findings. Chapters 2-13, respectively, provide greater detail on the individual evaluations of the curricula implemented by each research team including information on the curricula, the demographics of the site-specific samples, assignment, fidelity of implementation, and results. Appendix A presents results from a secondary analysis of the data. Appendix B provides greater detail regarding the data analyses conducted. Appendixes C and D provide additional information regarding the outcome measures.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code Doors to Discovery vs teacher developed curricula (Chapter 6)","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education, statistics, data, data sets, products, search tools, data access tools, publications, surveys, working papers, ordering information, education indicators, CD-ROMs, elementary/secondary education, postsecondary education, libraries, school locator, education finance, national assessments","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium (2008) Effects of preschool curriculum programs on school readiness: Report from the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research initiative.

Institute of Education Sciences (IES) began the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research (PCER) initiative to conduct rigorous efficacy evaluations of available preschool curricula. Twelve research teams implemented one or two curricula in preschool settings serving predominantly low-income children under an experimental design. For each team, preschools or classrooms were randomly assigned to the intervention curricula or control curricula and the children were followed from pre-kindergarten through kindergarten. IES contracted with RTI International (RTI) and Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) to evaluate the impact of each of the 14 curricula implemented using a common set of measures with the cohort of children beginning preschool in the summer-fall of 2003. This report provides the individual results for each curriculum from the evaluations by RTI and MPR. Chapter 1 describes the PCER initiative and details the common elements of the evaluations including the experimental design, implementation, analysis, results, and findings. Chapters 2-13, respectively, provide greater detail on the individual evaluations of the curricula implemented by each research team including information on the curricula, the demographics of the site-specific samples, assignment, fidelity of implementation, and results. Appendix A presents results from a secondary analysis of the data. Appendix B provides greater detail regarding the data analyses conducted. Appendixes C and D provide additional information regarding the outcome measures.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code Early Literacy and Learning Model (ELLM) vs control (Various curriculums: Creative Curriculum, Beyond Centers and Circletime, High Reach Learning Pre-K and High/Scope) (Chapter 7)","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education, statistics, data, data sets, products, search tools, data access tools, publications, surveys, working papers, ordering information, education indicators, CD-ROMs, elementary/secondary education, postsecondary education, libraries, school locator, education finance, national assessments","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium (2008) Effects of preschool curriculum programs on school readiness: Report from the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research initiative.

Institute of Education Sciences (IES) began the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research (PCER) initiative to conduct rigorous efficacy evaluations of available preschool curricula. Twelve research teams implemented one or two curricula in preschool settings serving predominantly low-income children under an experimental design. For each team, preschools or classrooms were randomly assigned to the intervention curricula or control curricula and the children were followed from pre-kindergarten through kindergarten. IES contracted with RTI International (RTI) and Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) to evaluate the impact of each of the 14 curricula implemented using a common set of measures with the cohort of children beginning preschool in the summer-fall of 2003. This report provides the individual results for each curriculum from the evaluations by RTI and MPR. Chapter 1 describes the PCER initiative and details the common elements of the evaluations including the experimental design, implementation, analysis, results, and findings. Chapters 2-13, respectively, provide greater detail on the individual evaluations of the curricula implemented by each research team including information on the curricula, the demographics of the site-specific samples, assignment, fidelity of implementation, and results. Appendix A presents results from a secondary analysis of the data. Appendix B provides greater detail regarding the data analyses conducted. Appendixes C and D provide additional information regarding the outcome measures.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code Language-Focused Curriculum vs High/Scope curriculum materials.

Institute of Education Sciences (IES) began the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research (PCER) initiative to conduct rigorous efficacy evaluations of available preschool curricula. Twelve research teams implemented one or two curricula in preschool settings serving predominantly low-income children under an experimental design. For each team, preschools or classrooms were randomly assigned to the intervention curricula or control curricula and the children were followed from pre-kindergarten through kindergarten. IES contracted with RTI International (RTI) and Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) to evaluate the impact of each of the 14 curricula implemented using a common set of measures with the cohort of children beginning preschool in the summer-fall of 2003. This report provides the individual results for each curriculum from the evaluations by RTI and MPR. Chapter 1 describes the PCER initiative and details the common elements of the evaluations including the experimental design, implementation, analysis, results, and findings. Chapters 2-13, respectively, provide greater detail on the individual evaluations of the curricula implemented by each research team including information on the curricula, the demographics of the site-specific samples, assignment, fidelity of implementation, and results. Appendix A presents results from a secondary analysis of the data. Appendix B provides greater detail regarding the data analyses conducted. Appendixes C and D provide additional information regarding the outcome measures.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code Let’s Begin with the Letter People vs teacher developed curricula (Chapter 6)","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education, statistics, data, data sets, products, search tools, data access tools, publications, surveys, working papers, ordering information, education indicators, CD-ROMs, elementary/secondary education, postsecondary education, libraries, school locator, education finance, national assessments","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium (2008) Effects of preschool curriculum programs on school readiness: Report from the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research initiative.

The units, and the games and activities within each unit, are sequenced in\norder of complexity. Each thematic unit of the curriculum includes selected children’s books that address\ntheme-relevant vocabulary for small- and large-group reading activities. In addition, each thematic unit\nincludes small-group activities that provide children with the opportunity to attend to and practice the skills\nneeded to develop oral language, phonological sensitivity, and print awareness, and to receive individual\nfeedback needed to master each developmental level. Small-group activities are conducted 3-4 times a week.\nThe curriculum provides guidance to teachers on grouping children who are progressing at similar rates. The\nlarge-group and extension activities provide opportunities for children to use new skills in novel and varied\ncontexts.\"\n\"Open Court Reading Pre-K curriculum is a\nliteracy-focused curriculum. The curriculum content is presented in eight thematic units that address\nchildren’s identity, families, friends, social interactions, transportation, the physical senses, nature, and\ntransitions. Phonological, phonemic, and print-awareness activities are incorporated into each lesson.\nComprehension activities are also included in each lesson to help promote children’s understanding of\nliterature. Each day, teachers read literature selections that focus on the topic that is in a thematic unit.

Institute of Education Sciences (IES) began the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research (PCER) initiative to conduct rigorous efficacy evaluations of available preschool curricula. Twelve research teams implemented one or two curricula in preschool settings serving predominantly low-income children under an experimental design. For each team, preschools or classrooms were randomly assigned to the intervention curricula or control curricula and the children were followed from pre-kindergarten through kindergarten. IES contracted with RTI International (RTI) and Mathematica Policy Research (MPR) to evaluate the impact of each of the 14 curricula implemented using a common set of measures with the cohort of children beginning preschool in the summer-fall of 2003. This report provides the individual results for each curriculum from the evaluations by RTI and MPR. Chapter 1 describes the PCER initiative and details the common elements of the evaluations including the experimental design, implementation, analysis, results, and findings. Chapters 2-13, respectively, provide greater detail on the individual evaluations of the curricula implemented by each research team including information on the curricula, the demographics of the site-specific samples, assignment, fidelity of implementation, and results. Appendix A presents results from a secondary analysis of the data. Appendix B provides greater detail regarding the data analyses conducted. Appendixes C and D provide additional information regarding the outcome measures.","Comments":"CODERS: Please code Literacy Express vs High/Scope (Chapter 9) ","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education, statistics, data, data sets, products, search tools, data access tools, publications, surveys, working papers, ordering information, education indicators, CD-ROMs, elementary/secondary education, postsecondary education, libraries, school locator, education finance, national assessments","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"PCER Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research Consortium (2008) Effects of preschool curriculum programs on school readiness: Report from the Preschool Curriculum Evaluation Research initiative.

Forty-eight kindergarten children were selected for the study and classified as high, middle, or low segmenters based on their performance on the Test of Awareness of Language Segments (TALS) (Sawyer, 1987). Pretraining and posttraining measures consisted of segmentation ability, letter-sound knowledge, and reading words by analogy. Although the experimental group showed significant gains on each measure over no-training controls, analogy training affected children differently depending upon their prior segmentation level. Low segmenters gained most in segmentation ability with small, but significant, effects in letter-sound knowledge. Middle and high segmenters showed greatest improvement in their ability to perform the word reading by analogy task and in their letter-sound knowledge. This study provides support for a role for onset and rime units in beginning reading and may indicate how rhymes contribute to children's awareness of phonemes.","Comments":"Coders: The children were split into high, middle and low segmenters based on pre-tests. Please combine scores of these groups for experimental vs control.

This study examined the effects of a twelve week supplementary classroom literacy program on the emergent literacy skills of Head Start children. Ten classrooms of four year olds attending Head Start were randomly assigned to an intervention condition which involved the supplementary curriculum, or to a control condition which involved the regular Head Start curriculum. Children in the intervention classrooms received direct and explicit instruction in prereading skills which was delivered very systematically through developmentally appropriate practices. Children were pretested and posttested on a variety of language, literacy, and memory measures. Effects of the intervention were significant in the area of phonological awareness. Children's linguistic skill in recognizing and manipulating the phonemic segments in words was enhanced through activities, games, children's songs, and book reading involving rhyming, alliteration, and phoneme blending. Children in all classroom showed substantial improvement from pre- to posttest on Letter identification, letter-sound correspondence, word identification, and print conventions. Language of origin (whether participants spoke English or were bilingual) also affected performance on some of the measures. English speaking children tended to perform better on alliteration and phoneme blending tasks than bilingual children. An apparent language effect was also found on a measure of sentence memory. Results from the study have important implications vis-a-vis the controversy over the kinds of experiences children should have in their early schooling. This study demonstrates that direct and explicit classroom instruction which promotes phonological awareness and precursor reading skills can successfully occur at the preschool level in a developmentally appropriate manner. Thus, it provides information and guidance to practitioners about creating preschool opportunities for lower-income families that support literacy development and that address reading risk factors.","Comments":"ESDE: Use the post-test (only) scores from Table 7.

Sixty-one preschool children were randomly assigned to either a DI-Add-On group or DAP-Only group. The children were administered the Kaufman Survey of Early Academic and Language Skills (K-SEALS; Kaufman & Kaufman, 1993) and Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS; Good & Kaminski, 2002) prior to receiving the intervention and upon completion of the study. All of the children were also administered the DIBELS throughout the implementation of the DI intervention to monitor their progress throughout the curriculum. It was hypothesized that children receiving both DI and DAP would demonstrate greater attainment of pre-academic, language, and early literacy skills than children who only participated in the DAP curriculum. The research questions were statistically analyzed by multivariate analysis of covariance and single subject data analysis. Results of the study confirmed the hypothesis. Children who received both DI and DAP demonstrated greater attainment of pre-academic, language, and early literacy skills than children who only participated in the DAP curriculum.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Salaway Jennifer Lee; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"Education\r\nDirect instruction\r\nEarly childhood education\r\nEarly language\r\nEarly learning\r\nEarly literacy\r\nPreschool","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Salaway Jennifer Lee (2008) Efficacy of a direct instruction approach to promote early learning. , Duquesne University."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727280,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Training Phonological Skills and Letter Knowledge[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Schneider etal_2000.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215240,"AdditionalText":"4 groups: (a) letter-sound training, (b) phonological awareness training, (c) combined training in phonological awareness and letter knowledge and (d) control group. \nWe are comparing c vs d here","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727280,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"a) letter-sound training, (b) phonological awareness training, and (c) combined training in phonological\nawareness and letter knowledge.

From a sample of 726 screened kindergarten children, 138 were selected as children potentially at risk for dyslexia and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 training conditions: (a) letter-sound training, (b) phonological awareness training, and (c) combined training in phonological awareness and letter knowledge. A control group of 115 unselected (\"normal\") kindergarten children was recruited to evaluate the training effects. Results indicated that the combined training yielded the strongest effects on reading and spelling in Grades 1 and 2. Thus, these findings confirm the phonological linkage hypothesis in that combining phonological awareness training with instruction in letter-sound knowledge has more powerful effects on subsequent literacy achievement than phonological awareness training alone.","Comments":"Coders: There are 4 groups: (a) letter-sound training, (b) phonological awareness training, (c) combined training in phonological awareness and letter knowledge and (d) control group.

literacy skills is vital to future success in our society. Early intervention in critical areas of preschool language (vocabulary, comprehension, and narrative ability) and early literacy skills can facilitate this development. Typical interventions in preschool settings utilize storybooks to target these critical areas. However, research on large group teacher implemented storybook interventions to improve language skills is limited. In this study, Head Start teachers were trained to use a storybook intervention entitled, Storybook Activities for Improving Language (SAIL). The SAIL intervention consisted of four days of teacher led activities built around storybooks incorporating repeated readings, vocabulary activities, and retelling and acting out activities. A main focus was on vocabulary skills with secondary focuses on comprehension, narrative ability, and print awareness. Language and early literacy measures were administered at pre and post test to the SAIL intervention group and a control group. A multivariate analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effectiveness of SAIL on those measures. A significant effect was found for a vocabulary measure requiring children to name the categories and features of the target vocabulary words used in the SAIL intervention and for a narrative retell measure requiring children to retell a story within a time limit. There were no significant effects found for vocabulary measures assessing general vocabulary development, comprehension, or print awareness. Based on the results, five conclusions can be drawn: (a) the SAIL intervention led to increases in vocabulary skills; (b) the SAIL intervention did not lead to increases in comprehension skills; (c) the SAIL intervention led to increases in narrative ability; (d) SAIL did not lead to increases in print awareness; and (e) teachers rated the SAIL intervention favorably upon a program evaluation questionnaire. Despite limitations warranting caution in interpretation, this study added to existing research on storybook interventions in preschool in several ways. First, SAIL showed that a class-wide teacher implemented storybook intervention led to significant gains in vocabulary skills and narrative ability for preschool age children. Second, the four-day activity structure of SAIL was perceived as a beneficial learning experience by teachers.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use the adjusted post-test means from Table 9 (p 91) with Comprehension as the Toolkit Primary outcome and PPVT-III and CNCP as secondary outcome measures.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Simon Kathryn Laura Kimer; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Simon Kathryn Laura Kimer (2003) Storybook activities for improving language: Effects on language and literacy outcomes in Head Start preschool classrooms. , University of Oregon."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727287,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Early Reading Research (ERR)[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Solity etal_1999.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727287,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"The aims of the ERR are to investigate: (i) whether overall reading standards can be\nimproved and (ii) the extent to which reading difficulties can be prevented.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Solity etal_1999.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215246,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215255,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215563,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727287,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"The Early Reading Research (ERR) therefore introduces phonological awareness\ntraining into a broader context which focuses on a range of skills and teaching methods.\nIt represents a change in emphasis from much psychological research which typically\nexplores the relationship between phonological skills and reading, but rarely addresses\nthe school-based instructional factors which also contribute to children's progress in\nreading. As a result, a framework for teaching reading was developed in response to\nquestions raised by the LEA funding the research who wanted to explore (i) whether\ndifficulties in reading could be prevented by early intervention with beginning readers\nand (ii) the extent to which the research into reading and instruction could be\ntranslated into effective classroom-based interventions. The framework draws on in-\nstructional psychology, introduces schools to novel instructional approaches, only\nteaches phonological skills which are seen to be explicitly used in the reading and\nspelling processes, and has developed procedures to ensure that children can apply the\nskills they learn to reading a wide range of texts. The purpose of this stage of the\nresearch is to demonstrate that the reading framework is having a significant impact on\nchildren's learning.

The expectation is that 80% of Year 6 children will achieve Level 4 or above within the National Curriculum. This is seen to represent ‘zero tolerance of failure’. However, another interpretation of ‘zero tolerance of failure’ is that all children, including the 20% who are predicted to experience difficulties, will reach ageand skill‐appropriate targets in reading. This is the goal adopted for the Early Reading Research (ERR) reported in this article. The aims of the ERR are to investigate: (i) whether overall reading standards can be improved and (ii) the extent to which reading difficulties can be prevented. Despite all the recent research into phonological awareness and its relationship to reading, there has been very little research into how phonological skills are taught within a broader literacy framework to enable children both to increase their attainments and to prevent the occurrence of problems in learning to read. The ERR is a 2‐year study following a sample of 433 children as they progress from reception into Year 1. This article reviews recent psychological research on teaching reading, discusses the significance of instructional psychology and reports on the first year of the research when children were in six experimental reception classes implementing the ERR reading framework or six comparison schools following their usual approaches for teaching reading. The experimental group made considerably greater gains in reading on all but one of the assessment measures taken and demonstrated that the incidence of reading difficulties can be reduced quite dramatically, while at the same time raising the attainments of higher achieving pupils.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Solity Jonathan ; Deavers Rachael ; Kerfoot Sue ; Crane George ; Cannon Karen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0144341990190401","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Solity Jonathan, Deavers Rachael, Kerfoot Sue, Crane George, and Cannon Karen (1999) Raising Literacy Attainments in the Early Years: the impact of instructional psychology.

A pilot study was run (1) to test the effectiveness of the BRL programmed materials on Head Start children and (2) to see if posttest differences between subject and control groups would be due to the program or teacher differences. Seven Head Start classes were randomly designated as experimental groups and 4 as control groups. All subjects were pretested on the Peabody, the UCLA Language Concepts Test, and the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test. Also, the experimental classes were given the UCLA Visual Discrimination Inventory. The 7 teachers and 7 teacher aides from the experimental classes were trained in use of the BRL program before they administered it to their students. The program is highly structured and took 4 months to carry out. The children were posttested on the UCLA Language Concepts Test and the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test, but no significant between-group difference was found. Teacher behaviors appeared to be related to program effectiveness.

that through explicit teaching, beginning readers can develop the abilities (i.e., alphabetic coding and phonological awareness) considered to be key to early reading success. However, there is controversy as to the best means of promoting the development of these skills in the classroom. Through comparisons with control classrooms, the current study evaluated the effectiveness of a commercially available early-reading teaching program (Jolly Phonics - Lloyd, 1993) which combines these key elements. Time-sampling observations of experimental and control classrooms were undertaken to investigate which literacy components were related to reading and spelling success. Midway through the school year, children in 10 experimental and 10 control semor kindergarten classes (265 participants) were pretested on phonological awareness and early literacy measures to ensure group comparability. Classroom observations took place throughout the spring. At the end of the year children were tested on phonological awareness, and on a range of reading and spelling measures. Results showed that on 16 of the 19 measures including complex literacy skill knowledge (alphabetic coding) and application (reading and spelling both real words and nonwords), the experimental group significantly (and practically--i.e., most effect sizes were large) outperformed the control children. In addition, the performance of children considered to be \"at-risk\" for future reading failure (determined by very low pretest letter-naming scores) was analyzed. Results showed that this subsample of children also benefited from the Jolly Phonics program and outperformed their at-risk control counterparts. Furthermore, on most measures, the at-risk experimental group performed as well as the control children who were designated as having average literacy skills (and on one measure, scored significantly higher), thus, appearing to have changed their at-risk status. Correlational and multiple regression analyses found several links to literacy achievement, with the Phonics Literacy Component being the strongest predictor, followed by time Tent involved in letter formation. A unique mnemonic feature of the Jolly Phonics program (meaningful actions associated with letter-sounds) was also related to outcome measures.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Sumbler Karen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sumbler Karen (1999) Phonological awareness combined with explicit alphabetic coding instruction in kindergarten: Classroom observations and evaluation. , University of Toronto ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":10215932,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":727300,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Direct Instruction reading curriculum, Reading Mastery I,\"\n\"fluency building program, Great\nLeaps,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Trout etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215240,"AdditionalText":"1 treatment, 2 controls (at risk & non-at-risk).

In this study we assessed the outcomes of a supplemental daily Direct Instruction reading curriculum, Reading Mastery I., and fluency building program, Great Leaps, on the reading skills of students at risk for emotional disturbance and reading deficits. Over a period of 7 months, 6 students received a supplementary reading intervention and 12 students (6 control at-risk and 6 norm-referencing students without disabilities) received their regular classroom instruction. Curriculum-based measures assessing early phonemic awareness and basic reading skills (i.e., letter sounds, blends, and high-frequency sight words) were collected biweekly to assess student performance. The results of this study revealed that at-risk students receiving the Direct Instruction curriculum intervention met or outperformed their control at-risk and norm-referencing peers in all three reading measures. Implications of these findings and areas of future research are discussed.","Comments":"CODERS: There are 3 groups: Supplementary reading intervention, control at-risk and control norm-referenced.

study evaluated an intervention to enhance early phonological processing skills and reading. Early phonological processing skills are strongly related to progress in early literacy and phonological processing deficits are found related to specific reading disability. Thirty children aged 5.1–6.0 (15 in each of two schools) were assigned to an experimental or control group and compared before and after a 12-week intervention on measures of phonological processing skills and reading. There were no pretreatment differences between groups. The experimental intervention was based on findings of (a) early developmental phases in phonological recoding, (b) reciprocal development between phoneme awareness and phonological recoding, and (c) reciprocal development between phonological processing skills and early reading. The instruction was designed to facilitate the gradually expanding use of letter-phoneme relationships in early reading and spelling. The results indicated that, at posttest, the experimental group performed significantly better than the control group on the measures of phonological processing skills and in reading. Intervention that includes teaching the sounds of letters and phoneme awareness as part of using letter-phoneme relationships in recognizing printed words, in spelling, and in reading (pronouncing words) appears to be effective for enhancing early reading and may possibly reduce the probability of subsequent reading disability.","Comments":"© 1997 Council for Learning Disabilities","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vandervelden Margaretha C; Siegel Linda S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.2307/1511215","Keywords":"Sage CA: Los Angeles, CA","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vandervelden Margaretha C, and Siegel Linda S (1997) Teaching phonological processing skills in early literacy: A developmental approach.

Teachers read books to children and reinforced the vocabulary in the books by presenting concrete objects that represented the words and by providing children with multiple opportunities to use the book-related words. The teachers also were trained to ask open-ended questions and to engage children in conversations about the book and activities. This provided children with opportunities to use language and learn vocabulary in a meaningful context. Children who were in the interactive book reading intervention group scored significantly better than children in the comparison group on Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test—III and other measures of receptive and expressive language. Book reading and related activities can promote the development of language and literacy skills in young children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wasik Barbara A; Bond Mary Alice; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.93.2.243","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wasik Barbara A, and Bond Mary Alice (2001) Beyond the pages of a book: Interactive book reading and language development in preschool classrooms.

Teachers were trained in specific book reading and conversation strategies. The focus of the intervention was to train teachers how to increase opportunities for language and vocabulary development in young children. At the end of the year, children in the intervention classrooms performed significantly better than children in the control classrooms on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III and the Expressive One-Word Vocabulary Test (3rd ed.). In addition, teachers in the intervention classrooms used strategies that promoted language development during book reading and other classroom activities. Head Start teachers can be trained to implement strategies that have positive effects on children's language and literacy development.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Wasik B A; Bond M A; Hindman A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.98.1.63","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Wasik B A, Bond M A, and Hindman A (2006) The effects of a language and literacy intervention on Head Start children and teachers.

of 4-yr-olds attending Head Start were randomly assigned to an intervention condition, involving an add-on emergent literacy curriculum, or a control condition, involving the regular Head Start curriculum. Children in the intervention condition experienced interactive book reading at home and in the classroom as well as a classroom-based sound and letter awareness program. Children were pretested and posttested on standardized tests of language, writing, linguistic awareness, and print concepts. Effects of the intervention were significant across all children in the domains of writing and print concepts. Effects on language were large but only for those children whose primary caregivers had been actively involved in the at-home component of the program. One linguistic awareness subtest, involving the ability to identify the 1st letter and 1st sound of words, showed significant effects.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Epstein J N; Angell A L; Payne A C; Crone D A; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.86.4.542","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Epstein J N, Angell A L, Payne A C, Crone D A, and Fischel J E (1994) Outcomes of an emergent literacy intervention in Head Start.

The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 mo behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (2) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (3) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 wks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests. These assessments were repeated at a 6 mo follow-up. Educationally and statistically significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and follow-up on measures of expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: (1) School plus home condition (2) School condition  (3) control condition.

The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 mo behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (2) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (3) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 wks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests. These assessments were repeated at a 6 mo follow-up. Educationally and statistically significant effects of the reading intervention were obtained at posttest and follow-up on measures of expressive vocabulary.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: (1) School plus home condition (2) School condition (3) control condition.

Positive effects at the end of Head Start obtained in the original study were replicated, and effects on emergent literacy skills in both cohorts were maintained through the end of kindergarten. Effects of the emergent literacy intervention did not generalize to literacy outcomes at the end of 1st and 2nd grades. Growth in emergent literacy skills and literacy skills from year to year was strongly influenced by variation in the Head Start centers and school districts attended by children in the sample. Although children in the sample began formal reading instruction with relatively low levels of emergent literacy skills, they showed substantial gains with respect to national norms by the end of 2nd grade.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Whitehurst G J; Zevenbergen A A; Crone D A; Schultz M D; Velting O N; Fischel J E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.91.2.261","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Whitehurst G J, Zevenbergen A A, Crone D A, Schultz M D, Velting O N, and Fischel J E (1999) Outcomes of an emergent literacy intervention from Head Start through second grade.
