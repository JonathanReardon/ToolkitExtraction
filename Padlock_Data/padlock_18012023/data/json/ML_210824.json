Mastery learning classes are an enhanced version of con­ ventional instruction. Although the primary instructional mode is group­ based, feedback from diagnostic formative tests provides information about progress in leaming to individual students and the teacher. Stu­ dents who do not initially meet an 80 percent criterion set for mastery are given additional opportunities to participate in learning and are not introduced to new learning until most acquire the cognitive entry be­ haviors needed to succeed. Corrective strategies provide students with alternative cues and reinforcements, allowing for a periodic individuali­ zation of instruction. 3. Tutoring approximates a maximal quality of instruction be­ cause of i t s adaptability to the learning needs of individuals. A skill­ ful tutor continually assesses the effectiveness of cues by observing the responses of the student, readjusting and adding cues when the need is indicated, and gauges the amount and kind of practice required to assure maximal level of participation by the student.

In the tutorials of the studies, students were held to a criterion of 90 percent accuracy on formative tests.

Three different quality of instruction conditions were used in the studies: (a) tutoring, a maximal quality which adapts each component of quality of instruction to the individual, (b) conventional group-based instruction, a minimal quality which is least adaptive to individual learning needs, and (c) mastery learning, a quality which lies between the two extremes exemplified by tutoring and conventional instruction. The effects of quality of instruction on achievement and on students' engagement in learning were examined. The relations which developed between the students' prior characteristics (aptitude and prior achievement) and their subsequent achievement under the three different learning conditions were also examined. In addition, the studies investigated the effects of achievement and students' perception of achievement on the affect (attitude and interest) students developed toward learning. Three studies were conducted. In each of the studies, students were randomly assigned to tutoring, conventional, or mastery learning conditions. Three different grade levels and two different academic content areas were involved. Students in grades four and five were taught probability, and students in grade eight were taught cartography. The results of all three studies strongly indicate that quality of instruction has a pervasive influence on the achievement students attain and on the extent to which their achievement is related to either their aptitude or prior achievement. In these studies, 90% of the students who received tutoring and about 70% of the students who learned under mastery conditions attained levels of summative achievement reached by only the highest-achieving 20% of the students under conventional conditions. In tutoring and mastery conditions, the relations between summative achievement and students' aptitude or prior achievement were weak, but under conventional conditions, the relations remained comparatively strong. The effects of quality of instruction were also evident in the students' engagement in learning. The highest levels of task involvement were found for students receiving tutoring, followed by the levels found for students in mastery learning conditions. The lowest levels and largest variations in engagement in learning occurred in conventional groups. The results also indicate that affect toward learning emerges from achievement and perception of achievement. The relations between perception of achievement and affect were particularly strong. The major implication of these findings is that widely held assumptions about human potential for school learning must be reassessed. Inequalities in learning outcomes among students are not an inevitability of the differences in students' prior characteristics; they are, instead, the consequences of providing students with instruction which is not adapted to the learning needs of individuals. The results of these studies can serve as a yardstick for measuring the effectiveness of future attempts to enhance the quality of instruction available in schools.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus in coding Mastery vs. conventional (hypothesis 1) for the 8th grade for summative achievement results.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Anania Joanne ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\n0727:Curricula\n0727:Teaching\nCurricula\nEducation\nTeaching","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Anania Joanne (1981) The effects of quality of instruction on the cognitive and affective learning of students.. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023548,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5023559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406852,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":357117,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 3:\n[¬s]\"A comparison group was selected from a nearby school with a similar catchment area.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Arblaster etal_1991_OCR.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407105,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407107,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406860,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406862,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407035,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407112,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407109,"AdditionalText":"14","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407108,"AdditionalText":"22","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407119,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407153,"AdditionalText":"2","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406864,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407104,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406980,"AdditionalText":"22","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406985,"AdditionalText":"14","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406990,"AdditionalText":"Raw scores for both groups reported","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406991,"AdditionalText":"Raw scores reported ","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407091,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407095,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407130,"AdditionalText":"23.81","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407131,"AdditionalText":"8.92","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407132,"AdditionalText":"10.07","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407133,"AdditionalText":"6.11","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407159,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"Same -age tutoring, mastery learning, mixed ability teaching of reading,companion reading","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":357117,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Same-age Tutoring, Mastery Learning and the Mixed Ability Teaching of Reading[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Arblaster etal_1991_OCR.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"1.

Firstly, whether or not the use of a mastery-based reading programme led to accelerated progress by an experimental group in contrast to the progress made by a comparison group. Secondly, whether the use of same-age tutoring prejudiced either high or low attainers (as assessed pre-trial). Pre and post-test reading test raw scores for experimental and comparison groups were analysed using an independent t-test. The experimental group outperformed the comparison group by a significant margin (p < .005). By contrast an analysis of the scores of the bottom and top half of the experimental group using both the independent t-test and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test found no significant differences between the two subgroups in the experimental group. The paper describes the instructional methods used to teach the experimental group, with particular reference to same-age tutoring, and discusses the results in the light of the debate between the proponents of an individualized approach to teaching as opposed to a class-based approach to instruction.","Comments":"Can use data from hypothesis 1 to calculate a gain ES","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Arblaster G R; Butler C ; Taylor A L; Arnold C ; Pitchford M ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0143034391121009","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Arblaster G R, Butler C, Taylor A L, Arnold C, and Pitchford M (1991) Same-Age Tutoring, Mastery Learning and the Mixed Ability Teaching of Reading.

Results indicate that mastery Ss had significantly higher achievement, learning rate, and retention than nonmastery Ss, but used significantly greater amounts of time. When a metric of items retained/hour spent learning was computed, it was found that nonmastery Ss performed at a significantly higher rate than mastery Ss. Contrary to claims of mastery theorists, individual differences in time and learning rate remained stable across the experiment, and faster Ss had to wait for slower Ss to catch up. The price of increased achievement benefits of group-based mastery learning seemed to be increased time costs of (a) extra remedial time and (b) wasted time of faster learners. It is suggested that the time aspects of mastery learning theories may need to be revised to take account of these findings.

Twenty-seven fourth-grade children were taught 104 words over a 5-month period. Following instruction, these subjects performed tasks designed to require semantic processes ranging from single word semantic decisions to simple sentence verification and memory for connected text. On all these tasks, instructed subjects performed at a significantly higher level than control subjects matched on preinstruction vocabulary knowledge and comprehension. Thus, instructed subjects gave evidence both of learning word meanings taught by the program and of being able to process instructed words more efficiently in tasks more reflective of comprehension. The implications of these results for vocabulary instruction and for the role of individual word meanings in comprehension are discussed.","Comments":"ES data extraction from Table 2.

The investigation was executed at two of the five junior high schools in the school district with an approximate enrollment of 1,050 students at each of the two schools and approximately 350 students in seventh-grade classes at each of the two schools. The investigation consisted of 202 students in the experimental group and 199 students in a control group who were randomly assigned to seventh-grade mathematics classes by way of a computer. Teachers and students in the  control group were in a self-contained classroom using some form of a \"traditional\" approach. The students in the experimental group were learning under a team-teaching, individualized-instruction approach utilizing the strategy of learning for mastery. All students involved in the\nexperimental and control group took the SRA Achievement Test and the Mathematics Attitude-Interest Test as the pre-tests for this investigation.  At the end of the investigation, all participants took the SRA Achievement Test and the Mathematics Attitude-Interest Test again as post-tests.  T-tests for the significance of means were used for analyzing the data.  Students achieved significantly more mathematics in the team-teaching individualized instruction program utilizing the strategy of learning for mastery than students in the traditional classroom program. It also can be concluded, that according to the attitude test given, students of the team teaching individualized instruction program did not improve in attitude or interest in mathematics and neither did the students in the traditional classroom program.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The hypotheses which the study investigated were as follows: (1) The cooperative-mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization is significantly more effective than the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization in increasing the mathematical achievement of urban second-grade pupils with respect to selected numerical concepts and computational skills. (2) The cooperative mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization is significantly more effective than the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization in increasing the self-esteem of urban second-grade pupils. (3) The correlation between self-esteem and mathematical achievement of urban second-grade pupils is high and positive. The target population for this study was urban second-grade pupils attending schools in the Middle Atlantic Region of the United States. Analyses of covariance with a nested design were utilized to ascertain the effects of classroom organization on mathematical achievement and self-esteem at the.05 level. Three factors were used in this nested design: methods, classes/teachers nested under methods and ability. A Pearson Product-Moment Correlation was employed to determine if there was a relationship between mathematical achievement and self-esteem. The results of the analyses permitted one to conclude that the cooperative-mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization was superior to the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization. A significant interaction effect was also found. It was further revealed that there is a significant correlation between mathematical achievement and self-esteem. The overall superiority of the cooperative-mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization over the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization was sufficient to indicate that the act of combining cooperative learning procedures with mastery learning procedures would result in enhancing mathematical performance and self-esteem of urban pupils.","Comments":"Co-operative as intervention versus competitive as active control, use the adjusted means from Table 11 (SDs are available in Table 8). Please combine mastery and non-mastery orientation scores. Then combine class means and SDs for overall effect.\rCODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The population included four chemistry classes at Scottsdale Saguaro High School. Intact groups were assigned to experimental or control groups by random processes. The control group was presented the CHEM Study program in essentially a lecture-laboratory manner using the teacher's guide and its suggestions for instruction. The experimental group was permitted to study, or not study, the same material during class periods with no direct instruction by the teacher except in a tutorial manner. Pretest and posttest measures were obtained using the ACS-NSTA Chemistry Examination. A statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in chemistry achievement between the control and the experimental groups. The author concluded that within the expressed and implied limitations of the study: (1) chemistry can be taught by either a traditional technique or an independent study technique, resulting in approximately the same amount of achievement; and (2) achievement alone does not provide enough information relative to deciding whether an independent study or traditional technique should be used in teaching chemistry at the high school level.

In lesson one, children received introductory activities on five of the ten words to be taught, followed by mastery practice. The components of mastery practice were essentially the following: Children read each word from a card while the teacher recorded the number of trials needed by each child to reach criterion on words. Whenever a child made an error, the teacher recorded an incorrect trial and gave the correct response; the child immediately repeated the word. All pupils were able to reach criterion within five trials. Only misread words were recycled for children until each was mastered. Once a word was read correctly, it was dropped from that particular child's list. Children in a group who reached criterion on all words within a minimum number of trials re mained actively involved in the lesson through choral responding (after another child read a word correctly). Introductory activities and mastery practice were given in a similar fashion for the second five words. The two five-word units were then combined and practiced to mastery using the total set of ten words. Discrimination training was also provided during the first lesson. Children were shown training words mixed with miscue words in which either a middle or final letter was changed; they were instructed to read each real training word and reject (say \"no\" to) each nonsense miscue word. The second lesson began with a review of the ten training words followed by phrase and sentence reading practice in which children read first one-word, and then two-word and three-word phrases, and even tually sentences containing the ten training words.

Mastery instruction included teaching in 5-word units, dropping words as learned, and the reading of stories containing the learned words. While all Ss could read less than 10% of the words on the pretest, the experimental group achieved over 90% accuracy on the posttest. This was higher than the average posttest performance of the comparison group (72% accuracy). Results suggest that a majority of LD children can reach mastery on sight words within a reasonable time if sound remedial principles are applied consistently. The procedures described can serve both as a model of effective sight word instruction and as a diagnostic, trial-remediation technique for a disabled population.

This was done with the help of the instructional materials, constructed by the experimenter, which explained the solution to each item and provided additional explanation and examples of the idea tested by each item.\rThe formative tests were corrected by aides assigned to the Mastery classrooms; these aides recorded the students' scores and the items missed by each student. Items missed by more than half the class were explained by the teacher to the group. After that, individual students used the corrective materials to help understand the items they got wrong. \rFollowing this first round of testing and correction, students who had not initially reached mastery were retested on the items they neede to reach mastery. Students who still had not reached mastery on this second test repeated the corrective activities as time allowed. One instrumental period was alloted to all testing and correction. \r(page 59)\rUnder the teacher's supervision, students who reached mastery on the first formative test assisted students who had not reached mastery on the first or the second formative tests.\rMastery learning may be understood as an attempt to remedy, in a singel period of correction, errors which have developed and remained unremedied over many periods of instruction, so that students become well-prepared for subsequent learning tasks.\"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":406871,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 175:\n[¬s]\"T he s u bje ct ta u g ht in this re s e arc h was pro b a bility.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Burke_1983_OCR.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":406871,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 176:\n[¬s]\"M a s t e r y L e a r n i n g I n s t r u c t i o n u n d e r M a s t e r y L e a r n i n g w a s v e r y s i m i l a r t o i n s t r u c t i o n u n d e r t h e c o n v e n t i o n a l c o n d i t i o n s .

Under these conditions, students' learning is so full of errors that their achievement is far below their potential. Our thesis was that students' potential for learning will be developed to very high levels when instruction is fully adapted to each student's specific needs. To explore this idea, we contrasted students' cognitive and affective learning under tutoring, Mastery Learning, and conventional group instruction. Approximately 260 fourth and fifth graders participated in the three replications of this study. In each replication, students were randomly assigned to learn probability under one of the three instructional arrangements. Tutors were undergraduate education students in pre-professional training. The Mastery and the conventional conditions were managed by the students' regular mathematics teachers. Students' cognitive and affective characteristics were very similar at the beginning of instruction. By the end of three weeks, dramatic differences had emerged. The final achievement of the average tutored student was at a level above approximately 95 percent of the control students. The final achievement of the average Mastery student was at a level above approximately 85 percent of the control students. In addition, the high levels of final achievement were retained at high levels under tutoring and Mastery Learning. These differences held for both lower and higher mental processes, as defined by the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. What is especially noteworthy, under tutoring and Mastery Learning low aptitude students achieved at higher levels than students of high aptitude who received conventional instruction. These findings have many implications for schooling. Perhaps the most important implication is that the student's potential for learning can not be accurately predicted from the student's home environment, from tests of the student's aptitude, or even from the student's prior achievement under conventional instruction. The student's full potential for learning can properly be estimated only when the student is learning under the most effective instructional conditions that can be devised.","Comments":"This study provides results for 2 different grades (grade 4 & 5) and 3 different sites (grade 4 site 1, grade 5 site 1 & grade 5 site 2), three different groups (tutoring, mastery, conventional) and different sections of the tests used. Please compare the mastery learning vs. the conventional group on Site 1, Grade 4 focusing on FT1A, FT2A and FT3A vs post-test.

Stafford","Year":"1983","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"Ann

reason for chronically low achievement is that, under conventional instruction, the teacher's time and attention are so divided among a group of students that the specific needs of each student can not be met. Under these conditions, students' learning is so full of errors that their achievement is far below their potential. Our thesis was that students' potential for learning will be developed to very high levels when instruction is fully adapted to each student's specific needs. To explore this idea, we contrasted students' cognitive and affective learning under tutoring, Mastery Learning, and conventional group instruction. Approximately 260 fourth and fifth graders participated in the three replications of this study. In each replication, students were randomly assigned to learn probability under one of the three instructional arrangements. Tutors were undergraduate education students in pre-professional training. The Mastery and the conventional conditions were managed by the students' regular mathematics teachers. Students' cognitive and affective characteristics were very similar at the beginning of instruction. By the end of three weeks, dramatic differences had emerged. The final achievement of the average tutored student was at a level above approximately 95 percent of the control students. The final achievement of the average Mastery student was at a level above approximately 85 percent of the control students. In addition, the high levels of final achievement were retained at high levels under tutoring and Mastery Learning. These differences held for both lower and higher mental processes, as defined by the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. What is especially noteworthy, under tutoring and Mastery Learning low aptitude students achieved at higher levels than students of high aptitude who received conventional instruction. These findings have many implications for schooling. Perhaps the most important implication is that the student's potential for learning can not be accurately predicted from the student's home environment, from tests of the student's aptitude, or even from the student's prior achievement under conventional instruction. The student's full potential for learning can properly be estimated only when the student is learning under the most effective instructional conditions that can be devised.","Comments":"This study provides results for 2 different grades (grade 4 & 5) and 3 different sites (grade 4 site 1, grade 5 site 1 & grade 5 site 2), three different groups (tutoring, mastery, conventional) and different sections of the tests used. Please compare the mastery learning vs. the conventional group on Site 1, Grade 5 focusing on FT1A, FT2A and FT3A vs post-test.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Burke Arthur Joseph; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\n0727:Curricula\n0727:Teaching\nCurricula\nEducation\nTeaching","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Burke Arthur Joseph (1983) Students’ potential for learning contrasted under tutorial and group approaches to instruction.. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407114,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407118,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406860,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406862,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406864,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407035,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407109,"AdditionalText":"36","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407095,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407108,"AdditionalText":"36","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407159,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407103,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406980,"AdditionalText":"36","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406983,"AdditionalText":"73.06","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406984,"AdditionalText":"15.76","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406985,"AdditionalText":"36","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406988,"AdditionalText":"54.03","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406989,"AdditionalText":"11.48","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407009,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407010,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407031,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407055,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407091,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407093,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215228,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215238,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":452665,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 11:\n[¬s]\"Mastery Learning[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Burke_1983_OCR_WS_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215240,"AdditionalText":"There are 2 experimental treatments in this study -

Stafford","Year":"1983","Month":"","StandardNumber":"","City":"Ann Arbor","Country":"","Publisher":"","Institution":"","Volume":"","Pages":"1-1","Edition":"","Issue":"","Availability":"","URL":"https://search.proquest.com/docview/252076952","OldItemId":"41683553","Abstract":"One reason for chronically low achievement is that, under conventional instruction, the teacher's time and attention are so divided among a group of students that the specific needs of each student can not be met. Under these conditions, students' learning is so full of errors that their achievement is far below their potential. Our thesis was that students' potential for learning will be developed to very high levels when instruction is fully adapted to each student's specific needs. To explore this idea, we contrasted students' cognitive and affective learning under tutoring, Mastery Learning, and conventional group instruction. Approximately 260 fourth and fifth graders participated in the three replications of this study. In each replication, students were randomly assigned to learn probability under one of the three instructional arrangements. Tutors were undergraduate education students in pre-professional training. The Mastery and the conventional conditions were managed by the students' regular mathematics teachers. Students' cognitive and affective characteristics were very similar at the beginning of instruction. By the end of three weeks, dramatic differences had emerged. The final achievement of the average tutored student was at a level above approximately 95 percent of the control students. The final achievement of the average Mastery student was at a level above approximately 85 percent of the control students. In addition, the high levels of final achievement were retained at high levels under tutoring and Mastery Learning. These differences held for both lower and higher mental processes, as defined by the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives. What is especially noteworthy, under tutoring and Mastery Learning low aptitude students achieved at higher levels than students of high aptitude who received conventional instruction. These findings have many implications for schooling. Perhaps the most important implication is that the student's potential for learning can not be accurately predicted from the student's home environment, from tests of the student's aptitude, or even from the student's prior achievement under conventional instruction. The student's full potential for learning can properly be estimated only when the student is learning under the most effective instructional conditions that can be devised.","Comments":"This study provides results for 2 different grades (grade 4 & 5) and 3 different sites (grade 4 site 1, grade 5 site 1 & grade 5 site 2), three different groups (tutoring, mastery, conventional) and different sections of the tests used. Please compare the mastery learning vs. the conventional group on Site 2, Grade 5 focusing on FT1A, FT2A and FT3A vs post-test.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Burke Arthur Joseph; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\n0727:Curricula\n0727:Teaching\nCurricula\nEducation\nTeaching","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Burke Arthur Joseph (1983) Students’ potential for learning contrasted under tutorial and group approaches to instruction.. , ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023559,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406847,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407111,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407105,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407106,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407107,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407115,"AdditionalText":"1","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406860,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406862,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5406864,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407035,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407109,"AdditionalText":"21","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407108,"AdditionalText":"21","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5407117,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":406873,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 4:\n[¬s]\"The students were stratified by grade level and blocked on two levels\nof mathematics aptitude (above and below the 50th percentile) measured\nwith the Arithmetic Skills Test of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills.

Some of the effects studied were: (1) the changes in the students' pattern of achievement, (2) the changes in the students' school-related affect, (3) the changes in teachers' view of students and of their role as teachers, and (4) the changes in parents' academic and occupational expectations for their children. The major thesis underlying the study is that improved levels of student achievement (within a class, school, or sample of the national school system) provided by an effective method of group instruction, will have a direct and positive influence on the students' school-related affect, on the teachers' view of their students and of themselves as teachers, and on parents' expectations for their children. An important factor in the study was the length of time students participated in a mastery school setting. Three samples of students comparable in selected background characteristics were studied. One sample had mastery learning instruction for three years. A second sample had mastery instruction for only a single year. The third sample had no mastery instruction. Spanish and mathematics achievement tests measured student achievement at the third, sixth, and eighth grade levels. A set of questionnaire scales measured the dependent variables relating to the affective outcomes of students, teachers, and parents. The results of the study indicate that the achievement students attain is strongly determined by the learning conditions provided in school. The average three-year mastery student was above 80 percent of the students in the conventional groups. The average one-year mastery student was above 70 percent of the students under conventional instruction. The patterns of students' school-related affect, teachers' view of students and of their role as teachers, and parents' expectations for their children were very similar to the pattern of student achievement. This suggests that increased levels of student achievement have a direct and positive effect on the affective outcomes of students, teachers, and parents.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

The individualized, contract-directed high school chemistry, course was characterized by the following: individual and small group activities, student self-pacing, which included teacher indicated minimum acceptable requirements, unit behavioral objectives citing multiple references, PACE learning packets for each unit that directed student day-to-day activities, PACE unit pretests, tape-recorded and printed unit summaries that assisted the student with content Integration, audio-visual experiment previews, student tutoring and team learning, topic-related seminars, lectures and demonstrations presented upon student request, investigator-designed supplementary materials for teacher-directed remedial action, topic-related full-length films and film loops, a quantity/quality grading system, and an underlying mastery learning philosophy. Standardized and unbiased administrative procedures were used to assign forty-four students to second period chemistry classes and forty-six students to third period classes. \nThe significant treatment effect demonstrated on the Semester Two Examination favored the control groups' students over the experimental groups' students. The significant treatment and academic ability interaction demonstrated on the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale favored the experimental middle academic ability groups' students over the control groups' middle academic ability students.

The Olson school day consisted of sixteen time modules of twenty-five minutes each. Students' and teachers' schedules cycled or repeated weekly. Group sixes, modes of instruction, and allocation of spaces varied considerably from the traditional format with an underlying mastery approach. The traditional Portland school day consisted of six time periods of fifty-five minutes each. Students' and teachers' schedules were constant day to day. The mathematics periods were for the most part for independent study or small group presentations. There was no difference in mean achievement, as measured by the Modern Math Understanding Test, between students taught under the modular plan and students taught under the traditional plan.  The mean score of the modular group exceeded that of the traditional group only in the high ability level and that by only one month. For the middle and low ability groups, the traditional group scored higher by five and one month, respectively.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms. Please code for Individualized instruction vs Traditional. \rESDE: Compare Individualised instruction (intervention) versus Traditional (control). Use the unweighted means and SDs from Table 13 for the SRA Modern Math Understanding test. You will need to combine the SDs for M & F using the Ns for the respective cells from Table 5 on p 164. There is a spreadsheet on Slack which supports combining means and SDs. This will allow a post-test only comparison.

The arithmetic test is in two parts - arithmetic\nconcepts and problem solving. In the arithmetic concepts sub-\nQ\ntest the following skills are represented:\"\n\"Concepts Involving Currency: reading and writing\namounts; counting; relative values of coins;\nmaking change.\n2) Concepts Involving Decimals; reading and writing;\nrelative sites; rounding; fraction, decimal, per­\ncent equivalents; fundamental operations - ways\nto perform, estimating results.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Cohen_1970_OCR_OPT.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":454605,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 21:\n[¬s]\"Concepts Involving Equations.\n4) Concepts Involving Fractions: part of a whole\nand part of a group; relative sises; reducing;\nterms; fundamental operations - ways to perform,\nestimating results.\n5) Concepts Involving Geometry: parallel and\nperpendicular lines; recognising kinds of\ngeometric figures; angles and triangles;\ndimensions, perimeters, and areas of polygons;\nparts and areas of circles; use of protractor\nand compass.\"\n\"Concepts Involving Measurement: quantity; time\n(telling time, time sones, calendar); tempera­\nture; weight, length (use of ruler, precision);\narea and volume; liquid and dry capacity; fun­\ndamental operations with compound denominate\nnumbers.\n7) Concepts Involving Numerals and Number Systems:\ncounting, ordinals; place value and zero as a\nplace holder; Roman numerals; odd and even\nnumbers; positive and negative numbers.\"\n\"Concepts Involving Percents: meaning and use.\n9) Concepts Involving Ratio and Proportion.\n10) Concepts Involving Whole Numbers: reading and\nwriting; relative sises; rounding; partition\nand measurement; averaging; fundamental\noperations - terms, number facts, ways to\nperform, estimating results.\"\n\"The arithmetic section of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills\ntakes sixty minutes; thirty minutes for each sub-test.\nThe organisation of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, while\nproviding a single test booklet for all skill areas and for all\ngrades, is around one continuous test in each area for all grades.\nBecause of the length of the tests, one would expect the\nreliability coefficients to be high.

investigation compared the relative effectiveness of three plans of junior high school organization on measurements of educational development and attitude using as criterion measures the grade level equivalent scores from the Modern Math Understanding Tests and weighted raw scores from the Minnesota Attitude Inventory Scale.  The Olson school day consisted of sixteen time modules of twenty-five minutes each. Students' and teachers' schedules cycled or repeated weekly. Group sixes, modes of instruction, and allocation of spaces varied considerably from the traditional format with an underlying mastery approach. The traditional Portland school day consisted of six time periods of fifty-five minutes each. Students' and teachers' schedules were constant day to day. The mathematics periods were for the most part for independent study or small group presentations. There was no difference in mean achievement, as measured by the Modern Math Understanding Test, between students taught under the modular plan and students taught under the traditional plan.  The mean score of the modular group exceeded that of the traditional group only in the high ability level and that by only one month. For the middle and low ability groups, the traditional group scored higher by five and one month, respectively.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 3 arms. Please code for modular group (intervention) vs Traditional (control). \rESDE: Compare modular group (intervention) versus Traditional (control). Use the unweighted means and SDs from Table 13 for the SRA Modern Math Understanding test. You will need to combine the SDs for M & F using the Ns for the respective cells from Table 5 on p 164. There is a spreadsheet on Slack which supports combining means and SDs. This will allow a post-test only comparison.

study was designed to compare the effectiveness of a individualized mastery instructional program with a traditional classroom instructional program in mathematics at Northwest Junior High School in Salt Lake City. This study was conducted in order to learn if individualized\ninstruction or traditional classroom instruction in selected mathematics subject matter would yield significant difference as measured by standardized tests. Also, it was desired to learn if individualized instruction and materials would yield significant difference in workstudy skills when compared to traditional instruction by standardized tests. The study was conducted to also learn if there would be significant difference on standardized tests in computational achievement between the fifteen subjects with lowest intelligence quotient receiving individualized instruction and the fifteen subjects with lowest intelligence quotient receiving traditional instruction. Finally, it was desired to know if there would be significant difference between subjects receiving individualized instruction compared to subjects receiving traditional instruction in the length of time needed to complete the study of selected subject matter. It was predicted that the individualized group subject would use more time. The thirty-one subjects who received traditional instruction and who are hereafter referred to as control group subjects, were randomly selected from the population which was the total enrollment of 914 at Northwest Junior High School. The thirty-one subjects who received individualized instruction and who are hereafter referred to as experimental group subjects, were individually matched to the control group subjects according to sex, age, intelligence quotient, and mathematics achievement. At the beginning of the study, eighth grade students were given the Stanford Achievement, Arithmetic Computation sub-test. Form X,and the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Test W, Form 1. The Stanford Test scores were used to help identify the experimental group subjects and as a pre-test to determine a mathematics achievement score. The Iowa Test of Basic Skills was used to determine a pre-test score in work-study skills. When the pre-testing was complete, the control group subjects received traditional instruction in the topics of decimal fractions, percent and ratio and proportion. Hie experimental group subjects first received a prescription to remove any subject matter deficiencies and then received individualized instruction in the same topics as the control group subjects. Control group subjects were given post-tests at the same time. Experimental group subjects were given post-tests when the subject and the instructor decided that the subject was prepared to be tested. Control group subjects wrote individual comments comparing their opinions of individualized instruction, which they had experienced as seventh graders, and traditional instruction. The pre-test scores were analyzed and t-tests were used to determine whether or not there were significant differences in the achievement of control group subjects and experimental group subjects before the treatment. The t-tests were used to determine if significance existed from the pre-test to the post-test scores. The tests were run on the post-test scores to determine if significance existed after instruction. An analysis of the findings showed that there was significant difference in favor of the control group, between control and experimental subjects in mathematics achievement. There was no significant difference in work-study skills achievement between control group subjects and experimental group subjects. There was no significant difference in mathematics achievement between the fifteen subjects with lowest intelligence quotient in the control group and the fifteen subjects with lowest intelligence quotient in the experimental group. There was significant difference in the amount of time needed to complete the study. The significance favored the control group subjects who used less time than the mean time of experimental group subjects.\n","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The three forms of programed materials were linear short-step, long-step linear, and branched programs. A list of operational objectives and an outline of content objectives both were prepared prior to the preparation of the short-step program. The program was drafted and initially tested with a full high school chemistry class. In further development and revision, segments of the program were presented to several high school students and two experienced high school teachers. A final testing of the program was accomplished by using it with a full high school class. The branched form of the program was prepared from the basic form by identifying key items and rearranging the basic program to allow students who answered the key items correctly to skip over practice and review frames. The longstep form of the program was prepared by deleting repeating, practice and review frames. A multiple choice, forty-four item achievement test in nuclear chemistry was constructed. Preliminary evaluations in three high schools with intact classes were each followed by a revision to produce a more reliable instrument. The basic test was used as both pre-test and retention test for / 2 the study. The post-test was an alternative form of the basic test. Validation of the test instrument and the programs was carried on by submitting them to a jury of five experienced high school teachers. Students who participated in the four study treatments were from two high schools in the same school district. The approximately 150 students initially in each group were reduced to twenty-six students per group when matched across groups on total number of science courses and total number of mathematics courses taken, measured intelligence and reading scores. During the study, experimental programs were administered by the usual classroom teachers of chemistry. The time for classroom consideration of nuclear chemistry was seven class days. The pre-test was administered immediately before the study of nuclear chemistry was initiated. The post-test was given the class period following completion of the study of nuclear chemistry and the retention test was given two months after the study was completed. All groups learned a significant amount during their study of nuclear chemistry. Statistical comparison of pretest post-test gain using an analysis of covariance showed that the groups using programs, considered as a unit, gained significantly more than the control group. Between groups comparisons using a t-test on gain means showed that only the pre-test post-test gain by the group using the branched form of the program was significantly greater than the gain 3 of the control group. On the post-test of achievement, the variance of the group using the branched form of the program was significantly smaller than that of the control group. The correlation of measured intelligence and achievement was significantly smaller for the group using the long-step program than the control group. Statistical comparison of retention test scores using an analysis of covariance showed that the control group had a significantly greater retention of the facts and principles of nuclear chemistry when compared to all groups using programed materials. The following conclusions could be made regarding the study: 1. Students using a branched form of a program to study nuclear chemistry achieved significantly more than those using the conventional lecture-demonstration method. Students using a long-step form of the program learned more than the control but the difference in gain means was not significant. 2. Students studying nuclear chemistry using the conventional lecture-demonstration method retained significantly more than those using the three forms of programed materials. 3. Individual differences were cared for at least in part as students using the branched form of the program had a smaller variance on the final test of achievement than those in the control group. Also, the correlation between achievement and measured intelligence was significantly smaller for the group using the long-step program than for the control.","Comments":"This study has 4 groups: control, short step linear, long step linear and branched treatment.

The three forms of programed materials were linear short-step, long-step linear, and branched programs. A list of operational objectives and an outline of content objectives both were prepared prior to the preparation of the short-step program. The program was drafted and initially tested with a full high school chemistry class. In further development and revision, segments of the program were presented to several high school students and two experienced high school teachers. A final testing of the program was accomplished by using it with a full high school class. The branched form of the program was prepared from the basic form by identifying key items and rearranging the basic program to allow students who answered the key items correctly to skip over practice and review frames. The longstep form of the program was prepared by deleting repeating, practice and review frames. A multiple choice, forty-four item achievement test in nuclear chemistry was constructed. Preliminary evaluations in three high schools with intact classes were each followed by a revision to produce a more reliable instrument. The basic test was used as both pre-test and retention test for / 2 the study. The post-test was an alternative form of the basic test. Validation of the test instrument and the programs was carried on by submitting them to a jury of five experienced high school teachers. Students who participated in the four study treatments were from two high schools in the same school district. The approximately 150 students initially in each group were reduced to twenty-six students per group when matched across groups on total number of science courses and total number of mathematics courses taken, measured intelligence and reading scores. During the study, experimental programs were administered by the usual classroom teachers of chemistry. The time for classroom consideration of nuclear chemistry was seven class days. The pre-test was administered immediately before the study of nuclear chemistry was initiated. The post-test was given the class period following completion of the study of nuclear chemistry and the retention test was given two months after the study was completed. All groups learned a significant amount during their study of nuclear chemistry. Statistical comparison of pretest post-test gain using an analysis of covariance showed that the groups using programs, considered as a unit, gained significantly more than the control group. Between groups comparisons using a t-test on gain means showed that only the pre-test post-test gain by the group using the branched form of the program was significantly greater than the gain 3 of the control group. On the post-test of achievement, the variance of the group using the branched form of the program was significantly smaller than that of the control group. The correlation of measured intelligence and achievement was significantly smaller for the group using the long-step program than the control group. Statistical comparison of retention test scores using an analysis of covariance showed that the control group had a significantly greater retention of the facts and principles of nuclear chemistry when compared to all groups using programed materials. The following conclusions could be made regarding the study: 1. Students using a branched form of a program to study nuclear chemistry achieved significantly more than those using the conventional lecture-demonstration method. Students using a long-step form of the program learned more than the control but the difference in gain means was not significant. 2. Students studying nuclear chemistry using the conventional lecture-demonstration method retained significantly more than those using the three forms of programed materials. 3. Individual differences were cared for at least in part as students using the branched form of the program had a smaller variance on the final test of achievement than those in the control group. Also, the correlation between achievement and measured intelligence was significantly smaller for the group using the long-step program than for the control.","Comments":"This study has 4 groups: control, short step linear, long step linear and branched treatment.

The three forms of programed materials were linear short-step, long-step linear, and branched programs. A list of operational objectives and an outline of content objectives both were prepared prior to the preparation of the short-step program. The program was drafted and initially tested with a full high school chemistry class. In further development and revision, segments of the program were presented to several high school students and two experienced high school teachers. A final testing of the program was accomplished by using it with a full high school class. The branched form of the program was prepared from the basic form by identifying key items and rearranging the basic program to allow students who answered the key items correctly to skip over practice and review frames. The longstep form of the program was prepared by deleting repeating, practice and review frames. A multiple choice, forty-four item achievement test in nuclear chemistry was constructed. Preliminary evaluations in three high schools with intact classes were each followed by a revision to produce a more reliable instrument. The basic test was used as both pre-test and retention test for / 2 the study. The post-test was an alternative form of the basic test. Validation of the test instrument and the programs was carried on by submitting them to a jury of five experienced high school teachers. Students who participated in the four study treatments were from two high schools in the same school district. The approximately 150 students initially in each group were reduced to twenty-six students per group when matched across groups on total number of science courses and total number of mathematics courses taken, measured intelligence and reading scores. During the study, experimental programs were administered by the usual classroom teachers of chemistry. The time for classroom consideration of nuclear chemistry was seven class days. The pre-test was administered immediately before the study of nuclear chemistry was initiated. The post-test was given the class period following completion of the study of nuclear chemistry and the retention test was given two months after the study was completed. All groups learned a significant amount during their study of nuclear chemistry. Statistical comparison of pretest post-test gain using an analysis of covariance showed that the groups using programs, considered as a unit, gained significantly more than the control group. Between groups comparisons using a t-test on gain means showed that only the pre-test post-test gain by the group using the branched form of the program was significantly greater than the gain 3 of the control group. On the post-test of achievement, the variance of the group using the branched form of the program was significantly smaller than that of the control group. The correlation of measured intelligence and achievement was significantly smaller for the group using the long-step program than the control group. Statistical comparison of retention test scores using an analysis of covariance showed that the control group had a significantly greater retention of the facts and principles of nuclear chemistry when compared to all groups using programed materials. The following conclusions could be made regarding the study: 1. Students using a branched form of a program to study nuclear chemistry achieved significantly more than those using the conventional lecture-demonstration method. Students using a long-step form of the program learned more than the control but the difference in gain means was not significant. 2. Students studying nuclear chemistry using the conventional lecture-demonstration method retained significantly more than those using the three forms of programed materials. 3. Individual differences were cared for at least in part as students using the branched form of the program had a smaller variance on the final test of achievement than those in the control group. Also, the correlation between achievement and measured intelligence was significantly smaller for the group using the long-step program than for the control.","Comments":"This study has 4 groups: control, short step linear, long step linear and branched treatment.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly. Please code the mastery learning (ML) which has academic outcomes. Also focus in ML against internal control for girls.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dolan L J; Kellam S G; Brown C H; Werthamer-Larsson L ; Rebok G W; Mayer L S; Laudolff J ; Turkkan J S; Ford C ; Wheeler L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1016/0193-3973(93)90013-L","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dolan L J, Kellam S G, Brown C H, Werthamer-Larsson L, Rebok G W, Mayer L S, Laudolff J, Turkkan J S, Ford C, and Wheeler L (1993) The short-term impact of two classroom-based preventive interventions on aggressive and shy behaviors and poor achievement.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly. Please code the mastery learning (ML) which has academic outcomes. Also code ML against external control for boys.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dolan L J; Kellam S G; Brown C H; Werthamer-Larsson L ; Rebok G W; Mayer L S; Laudolff J ; Turkkan J S; Ford C ; Wheeler L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1016/0193-3973(93)90013-L","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dolan L J, Kellam S G, Brown C H, Werthamer-Larsson L, Rebok G W, Mayer L S, Laudolff J, Turkkan J S, Ford C, and Wheeler L (1993) The short-term impact of two classroom-based preventive interventions on aggressive and shy behaviors and poor achievement.

This is a report of the short-term impact and specificity of the two interventions from fall through spring of first grade. The first intervention, the Good Behavior Game, was aimed at reducing aggressive behavior and shy behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to be an important developmental antecedent in first grade of later delinquency and heavy drug use, particularly when coupled with shy behavior. The second intervention, Mastery Learning, was designed to improve poor reading achievement, which has been shown to be an antecedent for later depressive symptoms, as well as a correlate of aggressive and shy behaviors. Each of the two interventions had a significant and very specific impact only on its own proximal target(s). In addition to main effects, there were theoretically important variations of impacts among subgroups of children. The Good Behavior Game appeared to have a greater impact in reducing aggressive behavior among the more aggressive children. The nature of the impact of Mastery Learning differed by gender, with female high achievers benefiting more from the intervention than female low achievers, and male low achievers benefiting more than male high achievers. Developmental epidemiologically based preventive trials provide a powerful means of addressing questions about etiology and development, particularly around the issue of the malleability of developmental processes. Important questions that future work could test are whether achievement is improved by improving aggressive or shy behaviors and whether aggressive or shy behaviors are improved by improving achievement. Such investigation would inform our understanding of their etiology. © 1993.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 2 interventions, two control groups (internal & external) and results are presented for boys and girls seperatly. Please code the mastery learning (ML) which has academic outcomes. Also code ML against external control for girls.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dolan L J; Kellam S G; Brown C H; Werthamer-Larsson L ; Rebok G W; Mayer L S; Laudolff J ; Turkkan J S; Ford C ; Wheeler L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":" https://doi.org/10.1016/0193-3973(93)90013-L","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dolan L J, Kellam S G, Brown C H, Werthamer-Larsson L, Rebok G W, Mayer L S, Laudolff J, Turkkan J S, Ford C, and Wheeler L (1993) The short-term impact of two classroom-based preventive interventions on aggressive and shy behaviors and poor achievement.

Each class was to contain between twenty and twenty-five students. Each of the six classes was scheduled at a different time of the school day. All students were randomly assigned to classes by computer, with the exception of those who transferred to the school from other schools. Three pretests were administered to each of six different classes. These classes included a control and experimental class of three different teachers. The pretests Included the Cooperative Arithmetic Test, the Cooperative Structure of the Number System, and the Attitude Toward Mathematics Scale. The classes were taught using the group-orlented approach in the control classes and an individualized approach with a 70% mastery criterion in the experimental classes. All classes used the same textbook. A t test was employed on the means of the losses in raw scores from the arithmetic pretest to the algebra posttest and on the means of the gains in raw scores from the Structure of the Number System pretest to the algebra\nposttest. The hypothesis concerning achievement could not be rejected with respect to the groups of Teacher A and C. However, the results of the two t tests with respect to the groups of Teacher B were inconsistent. In one case a significant difference was found while no significant difference was found in the other. A t test was also used on the means of gains in raw scores from the attitude pretest to the attitude posttest. No significant differences could be found. Therefore, the hypothesis concerning attitudes could not be rejected.","Comments":"There are 2 groups and 3 different teachers (A, B, C).

Each class was to contain between twenty and twenty-five students. Each of the six classes was scheduled at a different time of the school day. All students were randomly assigned to classes by computer, with the exception of those who transferred to the school from other schools. Three pretests were administered to each of six different classes. These classes included a control and experimental class of three different teachers. The pretests Included the Cooperative Arithmetic Test, the Cooperative Structure of the Number System, and the Attitude Toward Mathematics Scale. The classes were taught using the group-orlented approach in the control classes and an individualized approach with a 70% mastery criterion in the experimental classes. All classes used the same textbook. A t test was employed on the means of the losses in raw scores from the arithmetic pretest to the algebra posttest and on the means of the gains in raw scores from the Structure of the Number System pretest to the algebra posttest. The hypothesis concerning achievement could not be rejected with respect to the groups of Teacher A and C. However, the results of the two t tests with respect to the groups of Teacher B were inconsistent. In one case a significant difference was found while no significant difference was found in the other. A t test was also used on the means of gains in raw scores from the attitude pretest to the attitude posttest. No significant differences could be found. Therefore, the hypothesis concerning attitudes could not be rejected.","Comments":"There are 2 groups and 3 different teachers (A, B, C).

Each class was to contain between twenty and twenty-five students. Each of the six classes was scheduled at a different time of the school day. All students were randomly assigned to classes by computer, with the exception of those who transferred to the school from other schools. Three pretests were administered to each of six different classes. These classes included a control and experimental class of three different teachers. The pretests Included the Cooperative Arithmetic Test, the Cooperative Structure of the Number System, and the Attitude Toward Mathematics Scale. The classes were taught using the group-orlented approach in the control classes and an individualized approach with a 70% mastery criterion in the experimental classes. All classes used the same textbook. A t test was employed on the means of the losses in raw scores from the arithmetic pretest to the algebra posttest and on the means of the gains in raw scores from the Structure of the Number System pretest to the algebra posttest. The hypothesis concerning achievement could not be rejected with respect to the groups of Teacher A and C. However, the results of the two t tests with respect to the groups of Teacher B were inconsistent. In one case a significant difference was found while no significant difference was found in the other. A t test was also used on the means of gains in raw scores from the attitude pretest to the attitude posttest. No significant differences could be found. Therefore, the hypothesis concerning attitudes could not be rejected.","Comments":"There are 2 groups and 3 different teachers (A, B, C).

Seventeen classes of seventh-grade geography students were taught an instructor-developed geography unit with either mastery or nonmastery procedures. The mastery procedures contained corrective feedback components which were omitted for the nonmastery classes. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in either achievement or retention between mastery and nonmastery classes. Aptitude, as measured by a vocabulary test, correlated highly with unit achievement and retention regardless of the instruction strategy used. Therefore, verbal capability appears to be the overriding determinant of achievement or retention. Since mastery procedures normally require more time than nonmastery procedures and do not produce higher achievement levels, their use is questionable.

Both classes were initially comparable with respect to their scores on the \"Iowa Test of Basic Skills\". Students in the individualized class performed significantly better on the \"BSCS Comprehensive Final Examination\", the \"Test On Understanding Science\", the \"Facts About Science\" test, the \"Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal\"; had a better attitude toward science (Prouse Subject Preference Survey); and rated the teacher significantly higher on the \"Performance Scale for High School Biology Teachers\" than did students in the large groups approach. There were no significant differences on the \"BSCS Achievement Tests\" and the \"Nelson Biology Test\".

basic design of this experiment was the nonequivalent control group design. There were three fifth grade classes in the Experimental I treatment, three in the Experimental II treatment and three in the control treatment. These nine classes were randomly selected from fourteen fifth grade classes in six schools and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The subjects in this study were children of nine fifth grade classes from six schools in the Cortland Public School System, Cortland, New York. Class size varied from 19 to 30 students. At the time of pretesting there were 209 children included in the experiment. Due to attrition, this sample dwindled to 185 when the final data were collected. Therefore, in this study only the pre and posttest scores of the final 185 subjects were used in the data analysis.  Experimental I - (IVD) - the children in this group followed the treatment labeled Individual Vocabulary Development (IVD). The children worked on their vocabulary exercises individually with assistance from the teacher if needed to achieve mastery. Experimental II - (PGIVD) - the children in this group followed the treatment labeled Peer Group Interaction Vocabulary Development (PGIVD). These children worked on their self-directing and self-correcting vocabulary exercises in groups of twos, threes, or fours formed within the confines of the three vocabulary levels to achieve mastery. Control Treatment - (RCPVD) - The children in this group followed the regular classroom procedure for Vocabulary development, and is therefore labeled RCPVD. The entire Cortland School System uses the Lippincott Readers as the main basal series.  Reading achievement was measured by the Gates MacGinitie Reading Test, Survey D, Form-M administered as a pretest. Growth in reading achievement was measured by Form 2-M of the same instrument, administered as a posttest. There were no significant differences among any of the three treatment groups in vocabulary, comprehension or total reading posttest means on the Gates-McGinitie Reading Test at the end of the experiment.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

There were three fifth grade classes in the Experimental I treatment, three in the Experimental II treatment and three in the control treatment. These nine classes were randomly selected from fourteen fifth grade classes in six schools and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The subjects in this study were children of nine fifth grade classes from six schools in the Cortland Public School System, Cortland, New York. Class size varied from 19 to 30 students. At the time of pretesting there were 209 children included in the experiment. Due to attrition, this sample dwindled to 185 when the final data were collected. Therefore, in this study only the pre and posttest scores of the final 185 subjects were used in the data analysis. Experimental I - (IVD) - the children in this group followed the treatment labeled Individual Vocabulary Development (IVD). The children worked on their vocabulary exercises individually with assistance from the teacher if needed to achieve mastery. Experimental II - (PGIVD) - the children in this group followed the treatment labeled Peer Group Interaction Vocabulary Development (PGIVD). These children worked on their self-directing and self-correcting vocabulary exercises in groups of twos, threes, or fours formed within the confines of the three vocabulary levels to achieve mastery. Control Treatment - (RCPVD) - The children in this group followed the regular classroom procedure for Vocabulary development, and is therefore labeled RCPVD. The entire Cortland School System uses the Lippincott Readers as the main basal series. Reading achievement was measured by the Gates MacGinitie Reading Test, Survey D, Form-M administered as a pretest. Growth in reading achievement was measured by Form 2-M of the same instrument, administered as a posttest. There were no significant differences among any of the three treatment groups in vocabulary, comprehension or total reading posttest means on the Gates-McGinitie Reading Test at the end of the experiment.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

For example, the Mathematics Mastery programme of study for Year 7 includes 25 hours of work on fractions, including multiplication and division of fractions. One task that is offered during this topic is shown here. Pupils are asked to find which of the following expressions are equal to one-quarter. a) 1/3 × 3/4 b) 1/8 × 1/2 c) 13/22 × 11/26 d) 6/7 × 11/26 e) 4/3 × 3/16 f) 15/28 × 7/15 g) 8/9 × 9/32 h) 9/10 × 5/18 i) 1/2 × 1/2 j) 5/3 × 3/20 k) 9/8 × 2/3 l) 1/4× 1 m) 1/2× 1/4 × 2 n) 1/2 × 1/2 ×4 o) 1/3 × 1/8 × 18/3 p) 1/3 × 1/1 This task is designed to offer pupils the practice they need to develop fluency in multiplying fractions, while also encouraging them to engage conceptually with both the relative size of fractions and the effect of multiplication. For example: Why is expression (a) equal to one-quarter? What models or diagrams might you use to convince someone of this? Expression (e) is also equal to one-quarter. Compare (a) and (e). What is the same and what is different? If we already know that (a) is equal to one-quarter, how could we quickly know that (e) is also equal to one-quarter? How do you know that expression (l) is equal to one-quarter? How can you use the formal method for multiplying fractions to calculate the product? How can you know that expression (p) is not equal to one-quarter without calculating? Higher-attaining pupils, who have completed the full set of practice exercises and engaged with the above considerations, would not be ‘extended’ by moving on to division of fractions, or to a new topic. Instead, they are asked when the following are equal to one-quarter, and why. q) a/2 × 1/2a r) 1/4 × b/c s) d/4 × e/d This requires pupils to generalise from their conceptual understanding of the fraction products.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Jerrim etal_2015_Mathematics Mastery Secondary.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215564,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":356411,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"The Mathematics Mastery programme is a whole-school approach to teaching mathematics that aims to raise attainment for all pupils and close the attainment gap between pupils from low income families and their peers.

Ten days of staff time is required for training: half a day for the headteacher, two and a half days for the head of maths, and one day for each maths teacher (there were on average seven maths teachers per school). To calculate the cost of headteachers’ time, we take the median point on the headteacher pay scale in England and Wales (£75,222 11 ). This is then divided by 230 (the approximate number of working days in a year) to give a headteacher day rate of £327. 12 We then inflate this figure by a fifth to allow for other costs not directly incorporated into headteachers’ salaries (e.g. employer contributions to pensions) , giving a total cost of £392. 13 Analogous calculations have been made for heads of mathematics (two and a half days training at a final day rate of £251) 14 and class teachers (a total of seven days training, one day per teacher, at a final day rate of £141). 15 Thus total training costs are therefore equal to £1,740 per school per annum. This gives a total cost per secondary school of £7,740. There were, on average, 154 pupils per secondary school (7,712 children across the 50 initially recruited schools).

The programme aims to deepen pupils’ conceptual understanding of key mathematical concepts. Compared to traditional curricula, fewer topics are covered in more depth, and greater emphasis is placed on problem solving and on encouraging mathematical thinking. This evaluation assessed the impact of Mathematics Mastery on pupils in Year 7, after the programme had been implemented in schools for one year. It was intended that schools would also begin to use the programme in Year 8 in the second year of implementation, and continue until the approach was in place across the school. 44 schools from London and the South East participated in the trial, with a total sample of 5,938 pupils. Participating schools received training and resources to support the adoption of the programme, which was delivered by the education charity Ark.","Comments":"Please note there are two documents attached. One is the secondary maths mastery trial report. The other is the overarching summary report across both primary and secondary. Please focus only on the secondary school trial for this data extraction.","TypeName":"Report","Authors":"Jerrim John ; Austerberry Helen ; Crisan Cosette ; Ingold Anne ; Morgan Candia ; Pratt Dave ; Smith Cathy ; Wiggins Meg ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jerrim John, Austerberry Helen, Crisan Cosette, Ingold Anne, Morgan Candia, Pratt Dave, Smith Cathy, and Wiggins Meg (2015) Mathematics Mastery: Secondary Evaluation report.

Reading research and learning strategies research are pulled together to support the argument that the teaching of diverse learning strategies can improve reading comprehension and that the strategies should be embedded within the mastery learning framework. Since the purpose of this study was to develop and field test the materials, a controlled experiment was not conducted. Field test results (involving six classrooms matched on four variables related to achievement) strongly suggested that teaching learning strategies improves reading comprehension.

success in school learning. The Bloom mastery learning strategy proposes a sequence of steps which together encompass the variables of the Carroll Model and is, then, one implementation of this model. The present study attempted to apply the Bloom strategy in fifth grade classes in the subject of mathematics for one school year. Could this Bloom strategy be effective for a school year (nine months) in a regular curriculum content area for elementary students? Moreover, since there exists a deficit in learning among students of lower-socio-economic classes in relation to students of middle-socio-economic classes, school instruction may influence the achievement of groups of students in various ways. Would the Bloom strategy be equally effective when used in the classes of two different socio-economic communities? These two questions constituted the major focus of this study. Using the pre-test scores on the two Stanford Achievement sub-tests (Concepts and Applications) and the pre-test scores on the Mastery Criterion Test as covariates, an analysis of covariance produced no significant interaction on post-test scores between socio-economic class and treatment. It is clear that the experimental classes did not differ significantly from the control classes, nor did the Community L classes differ from the previous year's class on achievement scores. However, in Community M, the experimental classes did attain mastery of the mastery criterion in greater numbers and to a significantly higher degree than their previous year control classes. The time series study shows no increased learning rate for experimental classes of Community l-1 on the Stanford Applications sub-test, nor any increase for the Stanford Concepts sub-test. On the basis of data we conclude that the results are inconclusive with respect to the main study hypothesis. ","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

Students in the individualized class rated their teacher significantly higher than students in the larger group, and stated that their ability to organize their work increased. The scores of the two groups of students were not significantly different on the following tests: \"American Chemical Society Cooperative Examination-General Chemistry\", \"Test on Understanding Science, Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal\", the \"Prouse Subject Preference\", six CBA achievement tests, and the final examination.

studies have shown the positive effects of combining cooperative and mastery learning methods on mathematics achievement higher order questioning skills, and originality, but little is known, at present, about the effects of cooperative-mastery learning in other subject areas or on other cognitive outcomes. The problem of this study was to explore the effects of cooperative and mastery learning methods, alone and in combination, on first and second grade students' learning and retention of basic economic concepts. A 2 X 2 (cooperative X mastery) factorial design compared the achievement of one hundred-twenty students who were individually randomly assigned (using grade level as a stratification variable) to one of four treatment conditions?instruction on basic economic concepts using (1) cooperative learning, (2) mastery learning, (3) cooperative-mastery learning, or (4) a control treatment (no cooperative or mastery learning). All subjects were administered a written pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test on their understanding of economic concepts. To further probe children's understanding of economic concepts, a randomly selected sub-sample of sixty- four students was interviewed using an oral pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test. Overall, the results support the superiority of the cooperative-mastery learning method over either method alone in promoting the acquisition and retention of economic concepts. Pretest data verified the initial equivalence of groups. The cooperative-mastery learning group outperformed (a) the control group on all post-tests and delayed post-tests and (b) the cooperative learning group on all post-tests and delayed post-tests except the written post-test. By delayed post-test on the oral measure, the cooperative-mastery learning group was also outperforming the mastery learning group. As further evidence of the superiority of the cooperative-mastery learning method, the mean score of the cooperative-mastery learning group was greater than the combined mean scores of the mastery and cooperative learning groups on the oral post-test and delayed post-test. The authors suggest that the cooperative-mastery learning method is in line with current early childhood practices and has the capacity for simultaneously boosting the conceptual development and language development of young children. This capacity is said to stem from the method's provision of (a) specific, positive feedback, (b) a social context for sustained effort and involvement in a topic, (c) child?child communication exchanges, and (d) adult?child communication exchanges.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 4 conditions. Please focus in comparing total scores between the ML & control group. \nESDE: Please use the post-test scores rather than the delayed post-test scores.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Laney James D; Frerichs Dean K; Frerichs Linda P; Pat Luke K; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15566935eed0703_4","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Laney James D, Frerichs Dean K, Frerichs Linda P, and Pat Luke K (1996) The Effect of Cooperative and Mastery Learning Methods on Primary Grade Students' Learning and Retention of Economic Concepts.

determine whether selected mastery learning strategies might serve as a partial solution to articulation problems in level 3 French. The central question posited was one of determining whether certain desired learning outcomes (and those logically related to smooth program articulation) were encouraged by the utilization of selected mastery learning strategies. Specifically, the investigation was directed to two related questions: 1) Can mastery learning strategies lead to achievement gains? and 2) Can these strategies at the same time produce a lesser variance in student achievement? Two null hypotheses related to the amount of learning and one null hypothesis related to the variability of posttest scores were developed. The selected mastery learning strategies used in the study were additional information about the content and expectations of each unit of work before the work was begun, frequent testing and detailed feedback on the results of the tests, and extra attempts to improve performance on tests. The researcher also considered the practicality of applying mastery learning strategies to secondary school instruction in terms of time constraints of a traditionally scheduled school, required alterations in the curriculum, amount of teacher time required for planning and evaluation, and identification of strategies critical to success. Seventy-four students taking level 3 French comprised the research sample. The MLA-Cooperative Foreign Language Tests were administered at the beginning of the study and students were randomly assigned on a matchedpair basis to a control or an experimental group on the basis of measures of competence in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. After ten weeks of instruction, parallel forms of the standardized test were administered to measure gains made during the research period and to determine the variability of students' competencies as indicated by posttest scores. Statistical analyses of the data (t-tests and analyses of variance) indicated that 1) subjects in both groups made significant gains in listening, speaking, and writing, but not in reading; 2) that subjects were not significantly different with regard to the mean gain scores; 3) that from analysis of the subsections of the tests, both groups were basically the same (the experimental group made significant gains on 14 of the subsections while the control group made significant gains on 13 subsections); and 4) that there was no significant difference between the variability of the posttest scores for the two groups.","Comments":"Copyright - Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.

The study also examined the differential effects of cognitive entry procedures. Finally, you’re aware of the relationships between higher and lower behaviors within different settings of learning opportunities. Annotation: 208 students participated in the study. Four settings of learning opportunities were used: a specific learning algorithms without feedback correlators (a minimal learning opportunity - control group); a general-heuristic strategy without feedback-correctives; more feedback and correctives; and a general-heuristic strategy, a maximal learning opportunity. It was introduced to the teachers. All students, in each group - Linear Systems. It was shown that when the students were able to reach a mastery standard on HMP performance. HMP performance increased, but still remained relatively low. It’s not a bad idea. Furthermore, the study demonstrates two trends of cognitive growth. This has been the case for introducing heuristic strategies. In contrast, The correctives are higher and lower cognitive tasks. Correlations between LMP and HMP for each score. Finally, the study showed that there was a \"conventional\" learning condition. Less than 5% of the variation in the HMP or LMP scores.

study investigated the effects of student-teams using mastery learning strategies (STML) on mathematics achievement of fifth-grade children (N = 134). The experiment used a 2 x 2 (Student Teams x Mastery Learning) factorial design. Results showed higher achievement gains for pupils exposed to STML than for those exposed through more traditional instruction.

Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, intact classes were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: mastery learning (ML), cooperative learning (CL), cooperative-mastery learning (CML), and a control group with no mastery and no cooperative strategies. Results showed that students exposed to CML performed better than students exposed through more traditional instruction. In the second experiment, student interactions in CML were observed and linked to achievement. The data indicated significant differences between high and low achievers on giving help, receiving help, and individualized learning, but not on receiving no response to requests for help. The regression equation showed that initial achievement, giving help, and receiving help explained 98% of the variance in achievement. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus in comparing scores between Mastery learning vs. the control group.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mevarech Z R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00220671.1991.10886019","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mevarech Z R (1991) Learning Mathematics in Different Mastery Environments.

A 2 × 2 (Cooperative x Mastery) factorial study compared the cognitive performances of pupus who were trained to generate questions under cooperative learning (CL), mastery learning (ML), cooperative-mastery learning (CML), and a control treatment. Participants were 271 third and fourth-grade pupils. Intact classes within each grade level were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups. Results showed that CML and ML pupils scored higher on measures of higher order questioning skills and originality than did the CL group, who, in turn, scored higher than the control group. The educational implications of the study are discussed. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus in comparing the ML vs. the control group.

The purpose of this quantitative pretest-posttest and control-group design study was to first investigate the effects of a mastery goal approach to instruction on eighth-grade mathematic students’ academic ability, and also to examine the effects of the treatment on motivational constructs. For the first portion of the study, two groups of students, 43 in the control group and 36 in the treatment group, were examined to determine the effect of the treatment on the participants’ academic achievement on the STAR Math assessment. An independent-measures t test was used to evaluate the mean difference (MD ) in the scaled scores gains from STAR Math assessments to determine academic achievement, which indicated the treatment group had significantly higher achievement gains than the control group, MD = 32.44, p < .001, and d = .53. Next, a repeated-measures study of 57 students used a Motivational Orientation Inventory (MOI) as a pretest and posttest to determine any changes, as a result of the treatment, on the students’ academic motivational orientation, perceptions of classroom goal structures, and academic efficacy. Paired-samples t tests were conducted on the mean of each motivational construct in the MOI with the results indicating significant changes in the students’ performance-avoidance goal orientation. Findings can be used to enhance positive social change by providing mastery learning structures including individualized student pacing of instruction, remediation and retesting of standards, and student assessment based on mastery of material in order to motivate students to learn and promote higher levels of academic achievement.","Comments":"Please use the WS version for highlighting.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Miles Kent S;

Both groups studied the blue version of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) materials. Students were paired in the groups on the basis of their scores on Test 2, Background in Natural Sciences, and the composite of the Iowa Tests of Educational Development. Achievement was measured by use of the BSCS Comprehensive Final Examination for first year biology students. Additional data came from scores on the Brown-Holtzman Survey of Study Habits. Twenty-nine matched pairs of students were involved in the final data analysis.

The experimental group covered the COPES content but with audio-tutorial materials prepared by the investigator. No significant differences were found between the achievement scores of the experimental subjects and control subjects.

The study also examined the effects of intelligence and aptitude on achievement under these different instructional procedures.\r\rProcedure: The sample of this study consisted of 328 sixth grade students drawn from six shools in the state of Perak in Malaysia. An experimental control group design was adopted. The investigation used one control and four experimental groups enhanced cue, enhanced participation, enhanced cue-participation and feedback corrective. The actual experiment took approximately one month to complete. \r\rResults: The first hypothesis was to investigate the effects of enhancing cue and participation singly and in combination on involvement and learning outcomes. It was found that the means of involvement, achievement and affect for mathematics for the enhanced groups were significantly higher than those of the control group. It was also found that the feedback-corrective group was significantly higher than the enhanced groups on each of the criterion measures. The study investigated the effects of intelligence and mathematics aptitude on achievement under the different instructional conditions. Under the control condition, the relationship between achievement and prior ability measures was very high. However, the effects of prior ability measures on achievement were markedly diminished under feedback-corrective as well as under each of the enhanced qualities of instruction condition. The study also demonstrated that involvement in learning acted as a mediating variable between entry characteristics and learning outcomes. As involvement changed achievement and affect also changed, both positively and negatively. Conclusions: On the basis of the findings the following conclusions were made. Quality of instruction is a potentially powerful determinant of the levels of achievement, affect for the subject and involvement in learning. Enhancing the different components of the quality of instruction resulted in significantly higher learning than when these components were not enhanced. However, supplementing group instruction with feedback-corrective procedures resulted in significantly higher learning than enhancing the components of quality of instruction. The problem for further research is to determine how much more effective learning can be if improvements are made on each of the enhancement procedures or if all the components of quality of instruction are enhanced simultaneously. The goal of such research is to do as well as or surpass the presnet maximally effective instruction -- the feedback-corrective procedure.","Comments":"This study has 4 experimental groups and 1 control. According to the author the feedback corrective group is the mastery learning group. Please focus on comparing data between the feedback corrective and the control group.

foster favorable teacher attitudes toward the philosophy behind mastery learning. One other purpose was to help teachers acquire the skills needed to use mastery learning in their classrooms and to determine the effects on pupils when mastery learning techniques were used. Forty-four teachers and interns from four Indianapolis schools were equally divided into groups according to race and sex. The material developed was a Mastery Teaching module which included an introduction and six sections. A slide/tape accompanied each of the seven parts. An accompanying manual contained objectives, practice exercises, and feedback. The manual also included self-tests with answers for each section, a pre-test on prerequisites, and a project section. Pre- and post-treatment measures were administered to the teachers and interns on both cognitive and affective variables. The results indicated that teachers and interns acquired the mastery teaching skills and, used them to the degree that pupils perceived differences in their teaching. Teacher attitudes toward the mastery teaching philosophy were generally positive, and students' attitudes and achievement were favorably altered because of their teachers' use of mastery teaching.

The subject matter content consisted of scientific facts and principles embraced by the concept Matter Is Particulate. Fifty-eight classes were selected from six junior high schools in the Jordan and Weber School Districts to participate in the study. Class enrollment ranged from 16 students in one class to 41 in another. Of the 58 classes selected, 31 were taught by individualized patterns of instruction with a mastery learning orientation; the remaining 27 classes were taught by lecture/demonstration-centered patterns of instruction. The 58 classes were taught by 23 different teachers. During the Fall of 1969, the students participated in a pretesting program which included a subject matter achievement test and a mental maturity (l.Q.) test. The post-testing program, conducted nine to twelve weeks later, involved the administration of an alternate form of the same achievement test to determine student gains in subject matter content. The curriculum framework, which included an outline of the major scientific principles embraced by the concept Matter Is Particulate, was given to each teacher in both the individualized and the lecture/demonstration-centered patterns of instruction. The subject matter outline was Identical for both groups. Data used in this study were obtained from three tests whose validity and reliability were well established: Interaction of Matter and Energy Experimental Achievement Test Interaction of Matter and Energy Achievement Test, and the Verbal Reasoning and Numerical Abilities sections of the Differential Aptitude Tests battery. The following conclusions were drawn from the data analyzed in this investigation. 1. There was a relationship, significant at the .001 level, between the acquisition of subject matter content and the method of instruction. Students in individualized classes earned higher gain scores on the achievement test than those in lecture/demonstration-centered classes. 2. There was a significant relationship at the .001 level between the acquisition of subject matter content and the I.Q. level of the student. Students with high mental ability made higher gain scores than those with lower mental ability. 3. There was no significant relationship between the subject matter content and the following factors: (a) sex; (b) method and sex; (c) method and I.Q. level; and (d) method, I.Q. level, and sex. 4. There was a significant relationship at the .01 level between the subject matter content and a combination of I.Q. level and sex.","Comments":"MDE: Please compare individualised instrucion vs. lecture-instruction groups.

Subjects in the experiment were assessed for locus of control and experienced one of three treatments: no diagnosis or remediation; diagnosis with no remediation; or, diagnosis and remediation. Immediate achievement was measured at two points during the experiment, and retention was measured 30 days following the experiment. Diagnosis and remediation proved to be significantly effective in increasing retained achievement. Internal locus of control subjects out-scored external subjects in the areas of both immediate and retained achievement. Whites achieved higher than blacks in retention. Attitudes of all groups tended to be positive. These findings suggest that diagnostic or diagnostic and remedial instruction is an effective means of increasing the retention level of middle school students.","Comments":"There are 3 groups in this study (T1 serves as control group and T2 and T3 as treatment groups).

Subjects in the experiment were assessed for locus of control and experienced one of three treatments: no diagnosis or remediation; diagnosis with no remediation; or, diagnosis and remediation. Immediate achievement was measured at two points during the experiment, and retention was measured 30 days following the experiment. Diagnosis and remediation proved to be significantly effective in increasing retained achievement. Internal locus of control subjects out-scored external subjects in the areas of both immediate and retained achievement. Whites achieved higher than blacks in retention. Attitudes of all groups tended to be positive. These findings suggest that diagnostic or diagnostic and remedial instruction is an effective means of increasing the retention level of middle school students.","Comments":"There are 3 groups in this study (T1 serves as control group and T2 and T3 as treatment groups).

Both seventh- and eighth-grade students in the Demopolis Junior High School had learning activity packages (LAP) provided. Each student was given a folder which contained the packages being used and each student maintained a cumulative summary of his progress, showing both the LAP covered and its level of difficulty. Conditions and performance of LAP objectives were established by the teacher and the particular learner. Students were tested for mastery before each LAP and provided with diagnostic feedback to ensure the correct level was assigned.  Post-tests designed for each difficulty level on each LAP sub-category provided the means for determining satisfactory completion of a specific learning activity package. Non-LAP instruction in mathematics consisted of the conventional lecture-discussion method with the provision of textbook exercises. The instrument used to measure the academic growth of students in LAP and non-LAP instruction in mathematics was the California Achievement Tests, 1970 edition.  The four control variables used in matching students were: (1) chronological age, (2) sex, (3) race, and (4) intelligence quotient. On this basis, fifty-eight students were matched so as to provide twenty-nine pairs. Twelve pairs (n = 24) comprised the seventh-grade sample and seventeen pairs (n = 34) made up the eighth-grade sample. Analysis of variance was utilized in looking for significant differences in academic achievement between the two treatments at each of the two grade levels. An examination of treatment means revealed that in grade eight students undergoing conventional classroom instruction consistently had a mean greater than those utilizing Learning Activity Packages. In no case was such a difference statistically significant at .05. By levels in grade eight, there were no statistically significant differences at .05. Treatment means in grade seven indicated that students achieved greater academic growth in LAP than in conventional classroom instruction. At no time, however, were differences significant at .05. No F values were significant at .05 in relation to levels nor to interaction (treatments x levels) in grade seven.\n","Comments":"MDE: Please code scores for grade 7.\nPlease use OCR version for highlighting.

Both seventh- and eighth-grade students in the Demopolis Junior High School had learning activity packages (LAP) provided. Each student was given a folder which contained the packages being used and each student maintained a cumulative summary of his progress, showing both the LAP covered and its level of difficulty. Conditions and performance of LAP objectives were established by the teacher and the particular learner. Students were tested for mastery before each LAP and provided with diagnostic feedback to ensure the correct level was assigned. Post-tests designed for each difficulty level on each LAP sub-category provided the means for determining satisfactory completion of a specific learning activity package. Non-LAP instruction in mathematics consisted of the conventional lecture-discussion method with the provision of textbook exercises. The instrument used to measure the academic growth of students in LAP and non-LAP instruction in mathematics was the California Achievement Tests, 1970 edition. The four control variables used in matching students were: (1) chronological age, (2) sex, (3) race, and (4) intelligence quotient. On this basis, fifty-eight students were matched so as to provide twenty-nine pairs. Twelve pairs (n = 24) comprised the seventh-grade sample and seventeen pairs (n = 34) made up the eighth-grade sample. Analysis of variance was utilized in looking for significant differences in academic achievement between the two treatments at each of the two grade levels. An examination of treatment means revealed that in grade eight students undergoing conventional classroom instruction consistently had a mean greater than those utilizing Learning Activity Packages. In no case was such a difference statistically significant at .05. By levels in grade eight, there were no statistically significant differences at .05. Treatment means in grade seven indicated that students achieved greater academic growth in LAP than in conventional classroom instruction. At no time, however, were differences significant at .05. No F values were significant at .05 in relation to levels nor to interaction (treatments x levels) in grade seven.","Comments":"MDE: Please code scores for grade 8.

effectiveness of short-term, tutorial-type computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in selected topics in high school chemistry. To determine CAI effectiveness, post-tests specifically designed for this study were administered at the completion of instruction and sixty days later. Control group students generally performed 20% higher than did CAI students on both post-tests. The CAI group, however, appeared to learn twice as fast, completing the chemistry program in from one-third to one-half the time required by classroom students. The increased learning rate called for self-pacing and meaningful time usage not ordinarily encountered in traditional instruction; students in CAI felt challenged to productivity. Students were favorably impressed by computer-assisted instruction in general.

The data gathered in the experiment in chemistry were from a pre- and post-achievement test. Cognitive achievement was statistically different (p < .025). Additional analysis revealed the greatest difference was between a Bloom and a traditional strategy. Gain score analyses failed to produce any significant differences. A Chi-square analysis of the number of objectives achieved produced significant values of .004 and .034, respectively, for the Keller and Bloom groups over the traditional group.","Comments":"This study has 3 groups.

The data gathered in the experiment in chemistry were from a pre- and post-achievement test. Cognitive achievement was statistically different (p < .025). Additional analysis revealed the greatest difference was between a Bloom and a traditional strategy. Gain score analyses failed to produce any significant differences. A Chi-square analysis of the number of objectives achieved produced significant values of .004 and .034, respectively, for the Keller and Bloom groups over the traditional group.","Comments":"This study has 3 groups.

develop a group instruction method which is as effective as a one-to-one tutorial method, and, to determine the extent to which cognitive and affective outcomes of learning are affected by the instructional conditions provided to students. Three different group instructional conditions were used in the studies: (a) enhanced cues, participation, reinforcement, and feedback-corrective procedure, a maximal group instruction, (b) conventional group instruction, a minimal quality which is not equally adaptive to individual needs of most students, and (3) mastery learning, a quality which lies between the two extremes and uses the feedback-corrective procedure. Two studies were conducted in two different content areas and two grade levels. The results of the two studies indicate that the achievement students attain, the attitudes they acquire toward themselves as learners, and toward various aspects of school learning as well as the relations between prior and subsequent achievement are strongly determined by the instructional conditions provided to students. Seventy-four percent of students under maximal group instruction and 57 percent of the students under mastery learning conditions attained the level of final achievement reached only by the top 17 percent of the students under conventional instruction. Under maximal group instruction 69 percent of the students reached the mastery criterion (80 percent) on higher mental processes in comparison to 57 percent in the mastery learning and only 8 percent in the conventional groups. Large differences were also obtained on lower mental processes. The average student in the maximal group instruction was above 96 percent of the students in the conventional groups. In the enhanced CPR plus mastery learning and mastery learning groups the relation between prior and final achievement was very weak (about 8 percent common variance) however, under conventional conditions the relations remained strong (about 60 percent common variance). The effects of the instructional conditions on selected affective outcomes were also evident in the alteration of attitudes over the course of the study. Students under maximal group instruction became on the average, 22 percent more positive toward themselves as learners, the subject matter, teacher and school than were students under conventional instruction. The former were also more internal in taking responsibility for their learning outcomes. The mastery learning group advantage over the conventional group averaged 12 percent at the end of the study.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus in extracting data for grade 6.

Three different group instructional conditions were used in the studies: (a) enhanced cues, participation, reinforcement, and feedback-corrective procedure, a maximal group instruction, (b) conventional group instruction, a minimal quality which is not equally adaptive to individual needs of most students, and (3) mastery learning, a quality which lies between the two extremes and uses the feedback-corrective procedure. Two studies were conducted in two different content areas and two grade levels. The results of the two studies indicate that the achievement students attain, the attitudes they acquire toward themselves as learners, and toward various aspects of school learning as well as the relations between prior and subsequent achievement are strongly determined by the instructional conditions provided to students. Seventy-four percent of students under maximal group instruction and 57 percent of the students under mastery learning conditions attained the level of final achievement reached only by the top 17 percent of the students under conventional instruction. Under maximal group instruction 69 percent of the students reached the mastery criterion (80 percent) on higher mental processes in comparison to 57 percent in the mastery learning and only 8 percent in the conventional groups. Large differences were also obtained on lower mental processes. The average student in the maximal group instruction was above 96 percent of the students in the conventional groups. In the enhanced CPR plus mastery learning and mastery learning groups the relation between prior and final achievement was very weak (about 8 percent common variance) however, under conventional conditions the relations remained strong (about 60 percent common variance). The effects of the instructional conditions on selected affective outcomes were also evident in the alteration of attitudes over the course of the study. Students under maximal group instruction became on the average, 22 percent more positive toward themselves as learners, the subject matter, teacher and school than were students under conventional instruction. The former were also more internal in taking responsibility for their learning outcomes. The mastery learning group advantage over the conventional group averaged 12 percent at the end of the study.","Comments":"MDE: Please focus in extracting data for grade 9.

The research also attempted to examine the power of predictability of final outcomes by prior cognitive entry behavior under different qualities of instructional conditions.Two studies were conducted in two different content areas and two grade levels. Three different group instructional conditions were applied: (a) enhanced cues, participation, reinforcement, and feedback-corrective procedure (CPR + FB/C), (b) conventional instruction, and (c) mastery learning (ML).The results indicate that under CPR ² FB/C conditions most of the students (69%) reached mastery criterion as compared to 57% and 17% in the ML and conventional groups, respectively.

The programme aims to deepen pupils’ understanding of key mathematical concepts. Compared to traditional curricula, fewer topics are covered in more depth and greater emphasis is placed on problem solving and on encouraging mathematical thinking. This evaluation assessed the impact of Mathematics Mastery on pupils in Year 1, after the programme had been implemented in schools for one year. It was intended that schools would also begin to use the programme in Year 2 in the second year of implementation, and continue until the approach was in place across the school. Eighty-three schools from London and the South East participated in the trial, with a total sample of 4,176 pupils. Participating schools received training and resources to support the adoption of the programme which was delivered by the education charity Ark.","Comments":"Please note there are two documents attached.

effects on achievement of using a mastery learning strategy for teaching selected anthropological concepts to sixth grade social studies students with the effects of using a more conventional classroom teaching strategy for teaching selected anthropological concepts to sixth grade social studies students. Methods and Procedure: two intact classes of 26 children each used the teach-test-reteach-retest feedback/correction process (mastery learning strategy) while two other intact classes of 27 and 28 each were taught by conventional methods which did not utilize the mastery learning strategy. Materials developed by The Anthropology Curriculum Project, University of Georgia, 1972, were used by the children and teachers involved in the study.  A 70% median score was required in each experimental group before the total group could progress to the next selected anthropological concept. Peer tutoring was primarily used for the reteaching section of the teach-test-reteach-retest (mastery learning) strategy of teaching. The hypotheses were examined by analysis of variance considering treatment by sex, by IQ, and by reading level with the anthropology achievement test score as the dependent variable. Use of the two-way factorial design allowed for testing of interaction between independent variables. The .05 level of significance was used to,accept or reject the various hypotheses. Results: the experimental method of teaching produced superior effects with male students. The mastery learning strategy of teaching had a decidedly positive effect upon low reading level students and upon low IQ students. The experimental method of teaching had no differential effect upon high reading level students, upon high IQ students, or upon female students. Conclusions: no significant differences at the .05 level were obtained on the overall comparison between mean achievement scores from those students receiving mastery learning treatment and from the students who did not receive mastery learning treatment.","Comments":"CODERS: Please use OCR version for highlighting.

the two groups of students under mastery learning and normal classroom instruction who reach the same criterion level of learning as measured by an achievement test show much the same similarity on other learning criteria?\" The learning criteria this study uses are the retention of the learned material on a relatively short term basis, transfer of this material to subject related novel situations, lower and higher mental processes attained or used in the process of learning, and positive affect and interest in the learning task.  The research for this study was done in two settings. The micro study was done in two middle class, white Chicago area high schools, whereas the macro studies were done in four Chicago area city colleges. Each of these two settings will be discussed separately. \nMicro Study: this study was done in two white middle class high schools in the Chicago area, and included 5 ninth grade beginning algebra classes of 138 students. At the end of instruction  the students took a final summative test on the chapter prepared by the writer of the text with the cooperation of the researcher. This test had 20 items, 15 of which were lower mental process and 5 of which were higher mental process items. The criterion level was set on these 20 items. In addition 10 items were constructed to measure transfer. A three way analysis of variance of level of learning, aptitude or time, and the kind of instruction was performed using the four learning criteria as the dependent variables. The correlations of level of learning and the learning criterion in each hypothesis, time or aptitude and the learning criterion, and finally the multiple correlations of level of learning and time or aptitude on the learning criterion for each hypothesis were obtained.  When the means of the criterion groups were compared with each other on the summative test, there were no significant differences among the groups.\nMacro Study: this study was conducted in 4 Chicago area Junior Colleges, three of these having a majority of black students (about 90%), and one having primarily white students (about 90%). Altogether 433 students participated in the study. The subject areas included Biology 103, 111, Mathematics 103, History 103, Psychology 103, and Spanish 103. There were altogether 16 classes in the study, 8 of these were mastery learning classes, and 8 others served as control classes.  The students' grade point averages were obtained as a general index of scholastic ability.  Level of learning was measured by a summative test given at the end of the course. This test was composed of lower and higher mental process items. The criterion level of learning was set at 70% mastery of the material. In five of the eight studies, the mastery classes as a whole did better on their summative test scores than the control classes, in three of them significantly so. \nBoth the results of the micro and macro studies show without a single exception that students who reach the criterion level on lower mental process items score significantly better on higher mental process items compared to students who have not reached this level. ","Comments":"Please focus in comparing scores between the ML & Control group at the macro study (4 schools).","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Yildiran Guzver ;

The research for this study was done in two settings. The micro study was done in two middle class, white Chicago area high schools, whereas the macro studies were done in four Chicago area city colleges. Each of these two settings will be discussed separately. Micro Study: this study was done in two white middle class high schools in the Chicago area, and included 5 ninth grade beginning algebra classes of 138 students. At the end of instruction the students took a final summative test on the chapter prepared by the writer of the text with the cooperation of the researcher. This test had 20 items, 15 of which were lower mental process and 5 of which were higher mental process items. The criterion level was set on these 20 items. In addition 10 items were constructed to measure transfer. A three way analysis of variance of level of learning, aptitude or time, and the kind of instruction was performed using the four learning criteria as the dependent variables. The correlations of level of learning and the learning criterion in each hypothesis, time or aptitude and the learning criterion, and finally the multiple correlations of level of learning and time or aptitude on the learning criterion for each hypothesis were obtained. When the means of the criterion groups were compared with each other on the summative test, there were no significant differences among the groups. Macro Study: this study was conducted in 4 Chicago area Junior Colleges, three of these having a majority of black students (about 90%), and one having primarily white students (about 90%). Altogether 433 students participated in the study. The subject areas included Biology 103, 111, Mathematics 103, History 103, Psychology 103, and Spanish 103. There were altogether 16 classes in the study, 8 of these were mastery learning classes, and 8 others served as control classes. The students' grade point averages were obtained as a general index of scholastic ability. Level of learning was measured by a summative test given at the end of the course. This test was composed of lower and higher mental process items. The criterion level of learning was set at 70% mastery of the material. In five of the eight studies, the mastery classes as a whole did better on their summative test scores than the control classes, in three of them significantly so. Both the results of the micro and macro studies show without a single exception that students who reach the criterion level on lower mental process items score significantly better on higher mental process items compared to students who have not reached this level.","Comments":"Please focus in comparing scores between the ML & Control group at the micro study.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Yildiran Guzver ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4\r\n0525:Educational psychology\nEducation\nEducational psychology","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Yildiran Guzver (1977) The effects of level of cognitive achievement on selected learning criteria under mastery learning and normal classroom instruction.. , ."}]}
