In reciprocal peer tutoring, learners alternate between the role of tutor and tutee. The common characteristic is that learners take on responsibility for aspects of teaching and for evaluating their success. Peer assessment involves the peer tutor providing feedback to children relating to their performance and can have different forms such as reinforcing or correcting aspects of learning.\r\rPeers are defined as other students or pupils at the same school or educational setting as the intervention group; or at another local school (e.g. secondary students tutoring pupils at their own or their peers' primary schools).

purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a seven-month curriculum prescribed physical activity (PA) intervention (the Active Smarter Kids [ASK] intervention) on executive functions in 10-year-old Norwegian children. A linear mixed model was used to analyze data from 971–1,123 fifth grade children at 28 intervention schools and 29 control schools. The intervention constituted three PA elements: PA educational lessons, PA breaks, and PA homework, adding 165 minutes of PA to the mandatory 135 minutes of PA and physical education. There was no effect of the intervention on executive functions in the intention-to-treat analyses. Per protocol analyses (n = 776–850) revealed small effects of the intervention on the composite score of executive functions, cognitive flexibility, and motor skills. Cognitively engaging and coordinative demanding activities/games seem viable options to increase executive functions and possibly improve academic performance in children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Aadland Katrine Nyvoll; Ommundsen Yngvar ; Anderssen Sigmund Alfred; Brønnick Kolbjørn Selvåg; Moe Vegard Fusche; Resaland Geir Kåre; Skrede Turid ; Stavnsbo Mette ; Aadland Eivind ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/00313831.2017.1336477","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Aadland Katrine Nyvoll, Ommundsen Yngvar, Anderssen Sigmund Alfred, Brønnick Kolbjørn Selvåg, Moe Vegard Fusche, Resaland Geir Kåre, Skrede Turid, Stavnsbo Mette, and Aadland Eivind (2019) Effects of the Active Smarter Kids (ASK) Physical Activity School-based Intervention on Executive Functions: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial.

To date, no information is available on the optimal frequency of physical activity on cognitive functioning in children. The current study examined the acute effects of one and two bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity on children's selective attention. Design Randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN97975679). Methods Thirty boys and twenty-six girls, aged 10–13 years, were randomly assigned to three conditions: (A) sitting all morning working on simulated school tasks; (B) one 20-min physical activity bout after 90 min; and (C) two 20-min physical activity bouts, i.e. at the start and after 90 min. Selective attention was assessed at five time points during the morning (i.e. at baseline and after 20, 110, 130 and 220 min), using the ‘Sky Search’ subtest of the ‘Test of Selective Attention in Children’. We used GEE analysis to examine differences in Sky Search scores between the three experimental conditions, adjusting for school, baseline scores, self-reported screen time and time spent in sports. Results Children who performed two 20-min bouts of moderate-intensity physical activity had significantly better Sky Search scores compared to children who performed one physical activity bout or remained seated the whole morning (B = −0.26; 95% CI = [−0.52; −0.00]). Conclusions Our findings support the importance of repeated physical activity during the school day for beneficial effects on selective attention in children.","Comments":"Main DE: Please compare Group A (control) versus Group B (one bout of physical activity). \nESDE: Please note the negative effect sizes in Table 2 need to be reversed as the measure is of distraction (selective attention).","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Altenburg Teatske M; Chinapaw Mai J.M; Singh Amika S; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2015.12.003","Keywords":"Adolescent\nChild\nCognition\nExercise\nPhysical activity\nSchool","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Altenburg Teatske M, Chinapaw Mai J.M, and Singh Amika S (2016) Effects of one versus two bouts of moderate intensity physical activity on selective attention during a school morning in Dutch primary schoolchildren: A randomized controlled trial.

To evaluate the effects of the introduction of physically active lessons on movement behaviors, cognitive, and academic performance in schoolchildren. Methods This was a cluster-controlled trial. A total of 61 students from the second year of elementary school in a public school in Brazil made up 2 intervention classes (n = 34) with the introduction of physically active lessons and 2 control classes (n = 27). Sedentary behavior, physical activity, cognitive, and academic performance were evaluated in 3 moments, which were compared using models of generalized estimating equations. Results The intervention was effective for reducing the standing time between the baseline and 3 months while increasing the walking time between baseline and 3 months and baseline and 9 months. There was a reduction in time in stationary activities and increased time in light physical activities between all moments. The intervention group increased their performance in the go/no go test, showing a smaller number of errors between the baseline and 3 months and baseline and 9 months, and a reduction in the test time between baseline and 3 months. No impact on students\\u0027 academic performance was observed. Conclusion Physically active lessons improve movement behaviors and cognitive functions among elementary schoolchildren.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use CI to get a SD (=(SQRT(A2)*(C2-B2))/3.92) and calculate effect size","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Barboza Luciana L S; Schmitz Heike ; Tejada Julian ; Silva Ellen Caroline M; Oliveira Advanusia S S; Sardinha Luís B; Silva Danilo R; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1123/JPAH.2020-0604","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Barboza Luciana L S, Schmitz Heike, Tejada Julian, Silva Ellen Caroline M, Oliveira Advanusia S S, Sardinha Luís B, and Silva Danilo R (2021) Effects of physically active lessons on movement behaviors, cognitive, and academic performance in elementary schoolchildren: ERGUER/Aracaju project..

Unfortunately, in Italy, the physical education teacher is not included in the school\\u0027s core personnel, and it is very hard to find a specific physical education program (PEP) that could improve preschool children\\u0027s motor and cognitive status. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the quotient of gross motor development (QGMD) and pre-literacy skills concerning visual analysis and spatial orientation abilities changed after 16 weeks of PEP (2 h/week) in preschool children. We conducted a school-based non-randomized pilot trial. It involved 119 preschool children, clustered in a control group [CG, n = 29, body mass index (BMI): 16.90 ± 3.16 Kg/m2] and an intervention group (IG, n = 90, BMI: 16.00 ± 1.75 kg/m2). Participants were assessed for literacy readiness, locomotor and object control skills before and after the experimental period. IG increased the locomotor, object-control skills and QGMD in response to PEP. As concerns the pre-literacy domain, no significant difference was found in visual analysis and spatial orientation skills between IG and CG groups. However, we detected improvements from baseline to post-test in IG children. In conclusion, this study contributes additional evidence suggesting how a PEP could affect not only motor skills, but also cognitive ones. Consistently with the growing research, interventions based on structured ludic-motor activities ensure health benefits for preschool children.

The Move 2 Learn (M2L) program is an evidence-based intervention designed to improve movement and pre-literacy skills in children ages 1.5–6 years. Purpose: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention as delivered by non-experts in a community-based setting. Methods: Staff from four community centers were trained to implement M2L. Two sites were evaluated using a quasi-experimental design and the remaining two were evaluated using a pre–post design. Movement and pre-literacy skills were assessed twice in all children. Implementation fidelity was assessed using a weekly checklist and through site-visits. Results: Thirty-one children (15 girls and 16 boys; age range 23–53 months) participated in the study. The results of the quasi-experimental study (n = 17) showed that there was an overall effect of the program on time 2 total gross motor scores (standardized beta = 1.3, p \\u003c.05) but not pre-literacy scores, specifically print or alphabet knowledge. The pre–post design (n = 14) showed significant change over time for total gross motor scores (Cohen’s d = 1.78) and print knowledge (Cohen’s d = 1.76). Conclusions: Overall, the M2L program seems to have had a positive impact on participants when delivered in a community setting by trained, non-expert leaders. Future research will need to evaluate the effectiveness of the program delivered by various educators in larger and more diverse samples of children, using more robust research designs, and to determine whether there is long-term effect of M2L on health and academic outcomes in children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bedard Chloe ; Bremer Emily ; Cairney John ; Cairney John ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/17408989.2019.1690645","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bedard Chloe, Bremer Emily, Cairney John, and Cairney John (2020) Evaluation of the Move 2 Learn program, a community-based movement and pre-literacy intervention for young children.

These principles focus on chil-\ndren’s physical, physiological, mental, and social develop-\nment to enhance and optimize motor skills.21 Control schools\ncontinued their regular PE curriculum with two PE lessons\nper week resulting in 1.5 hours/week, which at that time was\nthe mandatory minimum amount of PE stipulated by law in\nDenmark.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Bugge et al_2018.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":8302423,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]}],"Outcomes":[{"OutcomeId":86024,"ItemSetId":96455505,"OutcomeTypeId":0,"OutcomeTypeName":"Continuous","ItemAttributeIdIntervention":5407016,"ItemAttributeIdControl":5407003,"ItemAttributeIdOutcome":5407091,"Title":"Combined Grades","ItemTimepointId":0,"ItemTimepointMetric":"","ItemTimepointValue":"","TimepointDisplayValue":" ","ItemArmIdGrp1":0,"ItemArmIdGrp2":0,"grp1ArmName":"","grp2ArmName":"","ShortTitle":"Bugge (2018)","OutcomeDescription":"Results were extracted from the Danish National Test System, which was implemented nationwide in 2010.

This study is part of the CHAMPS study-DK, a quasi-experimental study that began in 2008. The intervention group consisted of six schools, and the control group consisted of four matched schools (mean age at baseline=8.4 years, kindergarten class fourth grade). Academic performance was extracted from the national test system from 2010 to 2014 (Math and Danish were measured at third and sixth, and second, fourth and sixth grades, respectively). Participants included 1888 students participating in at least one scholastic performance test. Linear mixed models were applied to test for differences between groups and adjusted for known confounders. No significant differences were observed between groups in the academic performance tests (control group reference); Danish second grade β=−1.34 (95% CI −9.90, 7.22), fourth grade β=0.22 (95% CI −6.12, 6.56), sixth grade β=1.03 (95% CI −5.02, 7.08), and all grades combined β=0.28 (95% CI −5.74, 6.31) and Math third grade β=−2.87 (95% CI −9.65, 3.90), sixth grade β=0.99 (95% CI −7.36, 9.34) and combined β=−1.20 (95% CI −8.10, 5.71). In conclusion, no significant differences were observed between intervention and control schools for scholastic performance. Importantly, there were no negative effects of additional PE on scholastic outcomes, despite more PE and longer school days for intervention children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Bugge A ; Möller S ; Tarp J ; Hillman C H; Lima R A; Gejl A K; Wedderkopp N ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/sms.12902","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Bugge A, Möller S, Tarp J, Hillman C H, Lima R A, Gejl A K, and Wedderkopp N (2018) Influence of a 2‐ to 6‐year physical education intervention on scholastic performance: The CHAMPS study.

Introduction Identifying a dose of physical activity (PA) that can improve cognitive function in children has important implications for school-day PA recommendations. Researchers and educators have interest in this link as it relates to both health and academic performance. This study examined the dose-response relationship between PA and improvement in cognition in a sample of fifth and sixth grade students. Methods Participants (n = 156) from eight classes each completed two of four different cognitive assessments on an iPad, both before and after exposure to one of four randomized, 10-min PA conditions (sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous). Conditions were standardized through use of videos to lead movement, and participants wore accelerometers to confirm fidelity to PA condition. The four cognitive assessments were selected from the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery, and included Dimensional Change Card Sort, Flanker, Pattern Comparison, and Picture Sequence Memory tests. Hierarchical linear regression models were used to estimate the effects of condition on each test using an intention to treat analysis. Results Fidelity to PA condition was acceptable for sedentary and light conditions, but became less precise for moderate and vigorous conditions. No significant time by condition interaction was observed for any of the cognitive assessment scores. Conclusions Results did not substantiate a dose-response link between PA intensity and selected measures of cognitive function. More research is needed to investigate the potentially nuanced effects of short bouts of PA on cognitive functioning in children.","Comments":"MDE: Please combine light, moderate and vigorous for experimental group vs sedentary as control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Calvert H G; Barcelona J M; Melville D ; Turner L ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.MHPA.2019.100293","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Calvert H G, Barcelona J M, Melville D, and Turner L (2019) Effects of acute physical activity on NIH toolbox-measured cognitive functions among children in authentic education settings.

Improving the academic achievement of youth in the United States is an area of interest and a critical indicator of the future success of the youth. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a comprehensive school physical activity and healthy eating program on 5th-grade students\\u0027 academic achievement, specifically reading and math. METHODS Overall, 628 (intervention: 377, 54% girls; comparison: 251, 49% girls) 5th-grade children participated across the 6 schools in a year-long comprehensive health intervention, completing curriculum-based academic achievement measures at 2 time-points. RESULTS Results showed that even after controlling for class clustering, age, sex, race, and T1 reading and math variables, students\\u0027 T2 reading and math achievement were significantly higher in the intervention group than the comparison group.

Brain network modularity is a principle that quantifies the degree to which functional brain networks are divided into subnetworks. Higher modularity reflects a greater number of within-module connections and fewer connections between modules, and a highly modular brain is often interpreted as a brain that contains highly specialized brain networks with less integration between networks. Recent work in younger and older adults has demonstrated that individual differences in brain network modularity at baseline can predict improvements in performance after cognitive and physical interventions. The use of brain network modularity as a predictor of training outcomes has not yet been examined in children. Method: In the present study, we examined the relationship between baseline brain network modularity and changes (post-intervention performance minus pre-intervention performance) in cognitive and academic performance in 8- to 9-year-old children who participated in an after-school physical activity intervention for 9 months (N = 78) as well as in children in a wait-list control group (N = 72). Results: In children involved in the after-school physical activity intervention, higher modularity of brain networks at baseline predicted greater improvements in cognitive performance for tasks of executive function, cognitive efficiency, and mathematics achievement. There were no associations between baseline brain network modularity and performance changes in the wait-list control group. Discussion: Our study has implications for biomarkers of cognitive plasticity in children. Understanding predictors of cognitive performance and academic progress during child development may facilitate the effectiveness of interventions aimed to improve cognitive and brain health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Chaddock-Heyman Laura ; Weng Timothy B; Kienzler Caitlin ; Weisshappel Robert ; Drollette Eric S; Raine Lauren B; Westfall Daniel R; Kao Shih-Chun ; Baniqued Pauline ; Baniqued Pauline ; Castelli Darla M; Hillman Charles H; Kramer Arthur F; Kramer Arthur F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/FNHUM.2020.00346","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Chaddock-Heyman Laura, Weng Timothy B, Kienzler Caitlin, Weisshappel Robert, Drollette Eric S, Raine Lauren B, Westfall Daniel R, Kao Shih-Chun, Baniqued Pauline, Baniqued Pauline, Castelli Darla M, Hillman Charles H, Kramer Arthur F, and Kramer Arthur F (2020) Brain Network Modularity Predicts Improvements in Cognitive and Scholastic Performance in Children Involved in a Physical Activity Intervention..

activity (PA) has been associated with enhanced cognition, brain development and concentration. This study evaluated whether increased physical education (PE) improved academic achievement. METHODS:We recruited 304 children (55% boys) from a Swedish school in Skane County in 1998-2002 when they were six to seven years of age and followed them through all nine mandatory school years. Their PE level was increased from 60 to 200 minutes per week, and their results were compared with 73 885 control children (51% boys) in the county who graduated in the same years and did the standard 60 minutes of PE per week. Their academic achievements were measured as their final grade scores and the proportion of students eligible for upper secondary school. RESULTS:The eligibility for further education increased in the intervention boys by 6.8 percentage points and the mean grade score by 12.1 points, while in the control group as a whole, the eligibility rate decreased by 0.7 percentage points and the mean grade score increased by 1.7 points. No changes in eligibility rates or mean grade scores were seen in the intervention girls. CONCLUSION:Increasing weekly PE over nine years was associated with improved academic achievement in boys.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Cöster  ; J Fritz ; C Karlsson ; BE Rosengren ; MK Karlsson ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/apa.14278","Keywords":"Children\r\nPhysical Education\r\nPhysical Activity\r\nSchool Achievement\r\nAcademic Scores","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Cöster , J Fritz, C Karlsson, BE Rosengren, and MK Karlsson (2018) Extended physical education in children aged 6-15 years was associated with improved academic achievement in boys..

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of two high intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols for improving cognitive and mental health outcomes (executive function, psychological wellbeing, psychological distress and physical self-concept) in adolescents. METHODS: Participants (n=65; mean age=15.8±0.6) were randomized to three conditions: aerobic exercise program (AEP; n=21), resistance and aerobic exercise program (RAP; n=22) and control (n=22). HIIT sessions (8-10min/session) were delivered during physical education lessons or at lunchtime three times/week for 8-weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline and immediate post-intervention to detect changes in executive function (Trail Making Test, TMT), psychological wellbeing, psychological distress and physical self-description, by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. Intervention effects were examined using linear mixed models. Cohen's d effect sizes and clinical inference were also calculated. RESULTS: Small improvements in executive function (d=-0.32, 95%CI -9.12 to 9.77; p=0.386) and psychological wellbeing (d=0.34, 95%CI -1.73 to 2.37; p=0.252) were evident in the AEP group. Moderate improvements in executive function (d=-0.51, 95% CI -8.92 to 9.73; p=0.171), and small improvements in wellbeing (d=0.35, 95%CI -1.46 to 2.53; p=0.219) and perceived appearance (d=0.35, 95%CI -0.74 to 0.41; p=0.249), were observed for the RAP group. Mean feelings state scores improved from pre-workout to post-post workout in both HIIT conditions, with significant results for the AEP (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the potential of embedding HIIT within the school day for improving cognitive and mental health among adolescents.","Comments":"MDE: The study has 3 arms: aerobic exercise program (AEP);\nresistance & aerobic exercise program (RAP); and control .

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of two high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols for improving cognitive and mental health outcomes (executive function, psychological well-being, psychological distress, and physical self-concept) in adolescents. Methods Participants (n = 65; mean age = 15.8 ± 0.6 yr) were randomized to three conditions: aerobic exercise program (AEP; n = 21), resistance and aerobic program (RAP; n = 22), and control (n = 22). HIIT sessions (8-10 min per session) were delivered during physical education lessons or at lunchtime three times per week for 8 wk. Assessments were conducted at baseline and immediately postintervention to detect changes in executive function (trail making test), psychological well-being, psychological distress, and physical self-description by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. Intervention effects were examined using linear mixed models. Cohen's d effect sizes and clinical inference were also calculated. Results While results were not significant, small improvements in executive function (mean change (95% CI) -6.69 (-22.03, 8.64), d = -0.32) and psychological well-being (mean change (95% CI) 2.81 (-2.06, 7.68), d = 0.34) were evident in the AEP group; and moderate improvements in executive function (mean change (95% CI) -10.73 (-26.22, 4.76), d = -0.51), and small improvements in well-being (mean change (95% CI) 2.96 (-1.82, 7.75), d = 0.36) and perceived appearance (mean change (95% CI) 0.32 (-0.25, 0.86), d = 0.35), were observed for the RAP group. Mean feeling state scores improved from preworkout to postworkout in both HIIT conditions, with significant results for the AEP (P = 0.001). Conclusions This study highlights the potential of embedding HIIT within the school day for improving cognitive and mental health among adolescents.","Comments":"MDE: The study has 3 arms: aerobic exercise program (AEP);\nresistance & aerobic exercise program (RAP); and control .

research has confirmed a positive relationship between levels of physical activity and academic achievement. Some of these studies have been informed by neurological models of Executive Functioning (EF). There is a general consensus within the literature that the three core EF skills are; working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of these core EF skills has been linked with learning and academic achievement and is an essential component in the delivery of PE using a new and innovative approach called \\u0027Better Movers and Thinkers (BMT).\\u0027 A mixed methods design was used to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a 16-week intervention programme using BMT where 46 children were tested on two separate occasions for coordination and balance control, academic skills, working memory and non-verbal reasoning skills. One school acted as the control condition (21 students, aged 9 - 10 years) and another school acted as the intervention condition (25 students, aged 9 - 10 years). Quantitative data revealed an effect between pre and post-test conditions in the areas of phonological skills (p = .042), segmentation skills (p = .014) and working memory (p = .040) in favour of the intervention condition. Further analysis identified a gender-interaction with male students in the intervention condition making significant gains in phonological skills (p = .005) segmentation skills (p = .014) and spelling (p = .007) compared to boys in the control condition. Analysis of qualitative data from a sample of students from the intervention condition and their class teacher indicated good acceptability of BMT as an alternative approach to PE.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Dalziell Andrew ; Boyle James ; Mutrie Nanette ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5964/EJOP.V11I4.950","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Dalziell Andrew, Boyle James, and Mutrie Nanette (2015) Better Movers and Thinkers (BMT): An Exploratory Study of an Innovative Approach to Physical Education..

The aim of this study was to investigate whether fine or gross motor enrichment during a single session of recognizing letters b/d can improve within-session performance or delayed retention the following day in comparison to letter recognition practice without movement. Furthermore, the aim was to investigate children\\u0027s motivation to perform the specific tasks. We used a randomized controlled intervention study-design to investigate the effect of 10-min motor-enriched b/d letter training on children\\u0027s ability to recognize the letters b and d (n = 127, mean age = 7.61 ± SD = 0.44 years) acutely, and in a delayed retention test. Three groups were included: a fine motor-enriched group (FME), a gross motor-enriched group (GME), that received 10 min of b and d training with enriched gestures (fine or gross motor movements, respectively), and a control group (CON), which received non motor-enriched b/d training. The children\\u0027s ability to recognize b and d were tested before (T0), immediately after (T1), and one day after the intervention (T2) using a b/d Recognition Test. Based on a generalized linear mixed model a significant group-time interaction was found for accuracy in the b/d Recognition Test. Specifically, FME improved their ability to recognize b/d at post intervention (T0→T1, p = 0.008) and one-day retention test (T0→T2, p \\u003c 0.001) more than CON. There was no significant difference in change between GME and CON. For reaction time there were no significant global interaction effects observed. However, planned post hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference between GME and CON immediately after the intervention (T0→T1, p = 0.03). The children\\u0027s motivation-score was higher for FME and GME compared to CON (FME-CON: p = 0.01; GME-CON: p = 0.01). The study demonstrated that fine motor-enriched training improved children\\u0027s letter recognition more than non motor activities.

cluster randomized controlled trial (trial-number #) compares effects of two school-based physical activity interventions (aerobic vs. cognitively-engaging) on reading, mathematics, and spelling achievement; and whether effects are influenced by volume of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and baseline achievement. Twenty-two primary schools participated, where a third and fourth grade class were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Intervention groups were randomly assigned to a 14-week aerobic or cognitively-engaging intervention, receiving four physical education lessons a week. Control groups followed their regular physical education program. Academic achievement of 891 children (mean age 9.17 years, 49.4% boys) was assessed with standardized tests before and after the interventions. Post-Test academic achievement did not significantly differ between intervention groups and control group. A higher volume of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity resulted in better post-test mathematics achievement in both intervention groups, and post-test spelling achievement in the cognitively engaging intervention group. Compared to the control group, lower achievers in reading performed better in reading after the cognitively-engaging intervention. A combination of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and cognitively-engaging exercises seems to have the most beneficial effects. Future intervention studies should take into account quantitative and qualitative aspects of physical activity, and children’s baseline academic achievement.","Comments":"© 2020 The Author(s).

motor and cognitive functions develop rapidly during childhood. Physical activity and executive function are intricately linked during this important developmental period, with physical activity interventions consistently proving to benefit children’s executive function. However, it is less clear which type of physical activity shows the strongest associations with executive function in children. Therefore, this study compared executive function performance of children aged 8 to 12 that either participated in team sports or self-paced sports or were not involved in any kind of organized sports (non-athletes). Results demonstrate that children participating in team sports show superior executive function compared to children participating in self-paced sports and non-athletes. Importantly, children participating in self-paced sports do not outperform non-athletes when it comes to executive function. This study is the first to show that even at a very young age, team sports athletes outperform athletes from self-paced sports as well as non-athletes on a multifaceted and comprehensive test battery for executive function. Furthermore, our findings support the hypothesis that cognitively engaging physical activity, such as participation in team sports, might show stronger associations with executive functioning compared to other types of sports and physical activity.","Comments":"This study has 3 groups: a) self paced sports, b) team sports & c) no sports.

In study 1, 118 children from one Early Childhood Development Centre (ECDC) were tested using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2, and in study 2, 83 children were tested from six ECDCs using the Herbst Early Childhood Development Criteria test. The results showed that children exposed to eight months of Little Champs had significantly better overall scores for locomotor (p \\u003c 0.005) and object control (p \\u003c 0.01) skills compared to the control group. There was a statistically significant improvement in the cognitive scores of children who participated regularly in the programme (p \\u003c 0.0001). These findings suggest that even limited exposure to a low intensity programme for motor development can positively impact gross motor skills and cognitive function in disadvantaged preschoolers.","Comments":"MDE: Please code study 2","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Draper Catherine E; Achmat Masturah ; Forbes Jared ; Lambert Estelle V; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/03004430.2010.547250","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Draper Catherine E, Achmat Masturah, Forbes Jared, and Lambert Estelle V (2012) Impact of a Community-Based Programme for Motor Development on Gross Motor Skills and Cognitive Function in Preschool Children from Disadvantaged Settings..

The aim of the study was to examine the effects of qualitatively different PA breaks on children’s cognitive outcomes. Children (N = 142) aged between 7 and 9 years were allocated to a 20-week classroom-based PA program, with either high physical exertion and high cognitive engagement (combo group), high physical exertion and low cognitive engagement (aerobic group), or low physical exertion and high cognitive engagement (cognition group). Executive functions (updating, inhibition, shifting) and academic achievement (mathematics, spelling, reading) were measured pre- and post-intervention. Results showed that the combo group profited the most displaying enhanced shifting and mathematic performance. The cognition group profited only in terms of enhanced mathematic performance, whereas the aerobic group remained unaffected. These results suggest that the inclusion of cognitively engaging PA breaks seem to be a promising way to enhance school children’s cognitive functions.","Comments":"MDE: Please code the aerobic group (experimental) vs the cognition group (control) ","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Egger Fabienne ; Benzing Valentin ; Conzelmann Achim ; Schmidt Mirko ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0212482","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Egger Fabienne, Benzing Valentin, Conzelmann Achim, and Schmidt Mirko (2019) Boost your brain, while having a break!

We used a randomized controlled design to investigate whether using stability balls during the school day was associated with higher levels of on-task behavior and academic achievement and fewer discipline referrals. Method Over 9 mo, students in 2 second-grade classrooms in a southeastern rural elementary school used stability balls as chairs while students in 2 control classrooms used chairs as usual. We collected measures of on-task behavior, standardized measures of literacy and mathematics achievement, and discipline referrals. Results We found similar levels of on-task behavior and achievement in treatment and control classrooms and a downward trend in disruptive behaviors in treatment classrooms. Conclusion This study did not find use of stability balls for entire general education classrooms to be a practical use of resources for schools. More research with rigorous controlled designs is needed to support the use of stability balls for the general education population.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fedewa Alicia ; Davis Matthew A C; Ahn Soyeon ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.5014/AJOT.2015.014829","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fedewa Alicia, Davis Matthew A C, and Ahn Soyeon (2015) Effects of Stability Balls on Children's On-Task Behavior, Academic Achievement, and Discipline Referrals: A Randomized Controlled Trial..

This study investigated the academic achievement and physical activity differences between types of activity breaks implemented in elementary school classrooms. This study evaluated whether there was a difference between the impact of purely aerobic-based movement breaks and the impact of academic-based breaks on children’s academic achievement outcomes. Method: Participants included 460 children in 3rd grade through 5th grade at 4 elementary schools. There were 176 children in the schools that engaged in academic-based breaks and 284 in the schools that engaged in aerobic-only breaks. Schools were randomly assigned at the school level to implement either aerobic movement breaks with academic content infused within the breaks (“academic-based breaks”) or aerobic-only movement breaks without the addition of academic material (“aerobic-only breaks”) for approximately 10 min of activity per day. Math and reading achievement as well as children’s step counts were measured before and after the...","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Fedewa Alicia L; Fettrow Elizabeth ; Erwin Heather ; Ahn Soyeon ; Farook Minnah ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1080/02701367.2018.1431602","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Fedewa Alicia L, Fettrow Elizabeth, Erwin Heather, Ahn Soyeon, and Farook Minnah (2018) Academic-Based and Aerobic-Only Movement Breaks: Are There Differential Effects on Physical Activity and Achievement?.

Active breaks (ABs) include brief periods of physical activity as a part of the curriculum. This study aimed to investigate the AB acute responses on attentive skills and mathematical performance and attention in a primary school. Methods: A total of 141 children (aged 9.61 ± 0.82), divided into six classes, participated in this study. Each class was randomly assigned to three groups on the basis of the type of protocol performed during the three ABs scheduled in a school day: fitness (FIT), creativity (CREAT), and control group (CON). At baseline and at the end of interventions, all participants underwent the Stroop Color and Word test (SCWT) and the math test (MATH) to assess the level of attention and mathematical performance, respectively. The degree of enjoyment was evaluated through the modified Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale. Results: The factorial ANOVA showed significant differences between the FIT and CON in MATH test (p = 0.023) and SCWT (p = 0.034). CREAT and FIT groups showed higher degree of enjoyment than the CON (both ps &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: This study showed a positive acute impact of AB interventions. FIT positively influenced attentive and math performances more than the CREAT, probably due to the correct work/rest ratio and executive rhythm that allowed children to reach a good level of exertion. This report showed that ABs can be a useful and productive activity to be performed between curricular lessons.","Comments":"MDE: There are 3 arms: fitness (FIT), creativity (CREAT), and control group (CON).

Data assessment took place between February 2015 and May 2016 following the implementation of a 20-week school-based physical activity program. The d2 test was employed to assess selective attention, while the averaged end-of-year school results (math, life skills, home language, and additional language) were used as an indicator of academic performance. Physical fitness was assessed using the 20-m shuttle run test (VO2 max) and grip strength tests. We controlled for cluster effects, baseline scores in selective attention or academic performance, and potential confounders, such as children’s age, gender, socioeconomic status, self-reported physical activity (as determined by a pre-tested questionnaire), body mass index, hemoglobin (as a proxy for anemia, as measured by blood sampling), and soil-transmitted helminth infections (as assessed by the Kato-Katz technique).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResults \\r\\nOur multivariate analysis suggested that the physical activity intervention had a positive effect on academic performance (p = 0.032), while no effect was found on selective attention (concentration performance; p = 0.469; error percentage; p = 0.237). After controlling for potential confounders, the physical activity condition contributed to the maintenance of academic performance, whereas a decrease was observed in learners in the control condition. Furthermore, physically active and fit children tend to have better concentration performance (CP) than their less fit peers (self-reported activity; p 0.021).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion \\r\\nA 20-week physical activity intervention contributes to the maintenance of academic performance among socioeconomically deprived school children in South Africa. School administrators should ensure that their school staff implements physical activity lessons, which are a compulsory component of the school by the curriculum.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gall Stefanie ; Adams Larissa ; Joubert Nandi ; Ludyga Sebastian ; Müller Ivan ; Müller Ivan ; Nqweniso Siphesihle ; Pühse Uwe ; Randt Rosa du; Seelig Harald ; Smith Danielle ; Steinmann Peter ; Steinmann Peter ; Utzinger Jürg ; Utzinger Jürg ; Walter Cheryl ; Gerber Markus ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0206908","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gall Stefanie, Adams Larissa, Joubert Nandi, Ludyga Sebastian, Müller Ivan, Müller Ivan, Nqweniso Siphesihle, Pühse Uwe, Randt Rosa du, Seelig Harald, Smith Danielle, Steinmann Peter, Steinmann Peter, Utzinger Jürg, Utzinger Jürg, Walter Cheryl, and Gerber Markus (2018) Effect of a 20-week Physical Activity Intervention on Selective Attention and Academic Performance in Children Living in Disadvantaged Neighborhoods: A Cluster Randomized Control Trial.

The aim of this investigation was to examine the potential influence of varying types of exertion on immediate attentional performance on 138 primary school boys and girls.\\n\\nMethods: Subjects performed three different types of exertion [cognitive exertion (school curricular lesson), physical exertion (traditional physical education lesson), and mixed cognitive and physical exertion (coordinative physical education lesson)] at the same time of the school day for 3 wk. Before and immediately after each exertion session, subjects were administered the d2 Test of Attention.\\n\\nResults: Results showed that participants� attentional performances were significantly affected by exertion type (cognitive exertion vs physical exertion vs mixed cognitive and physical exertion; P \\u003c 0.05), by intervention (before vs after; P \\u003c 0.05), and by exertion type × intervention interactions (P \\u003c 0.01).\\n\\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that varying types of exertion have different beneficial influences on schoolchildren�s immediate cognitive performance","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gallotta Maria Chiara; Guidetti Laura ; Franciosi Emanuele ; Emerenziani Gian Pietro; Bonavolontà Valerio ; Baldari Carlo ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1249/MSS.0B013E3182305552","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gallotta Maria Chiara, Guidetti Laura, Franciosi Emanuele, Emerenziani Gian Pietro, Bonavolontà Valerio, and Baldari Carlo (2012) Effects of varying type of exertion on children's attention capacity..

examine the influence of different types of exertion on immediate and delayed attention in 116 primary school children divided in three groups of exertion [cognitive exertion - CE (school curricular lesson), physical exertion - PE (traditional physical education lesson), mixed cognitive and physical exertion - CPE (coordinative physical education lesson)]. CPE was the combination of physical load due to the practice of physical exercises and of cognitive load requested to perform movement-based problem solving tasks requiring accurate timing, temporal estimations, temporal production, and spatial adjustments. Children\\u0027s attentional capacity was tested before (pre) and after (at 0 min and at 50 min post) a CE, a PE, or a CPE lesson, using the d2-test of attention, and analyzed using a 3 × 3 × 2 mixed analysis of covariance with exertion type and time as within factors, gender as between factor, and baseline data as covariate. Effect sizes were calculated as partial eta squared (ƞ(2)). Results showed that participants\\u0027 attentional performance was significantly affected by exertion type (P \\u003c 0.0001), by time (P \\u003c 0.0001) and by exertion type × time interactions (P \\u003c 0.0001). The effect sizes ranged from medium (0.039) to large (0.437). Varying the type of exertion has different beneficial influences on the level of attention in school children.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Gallotta M C; Emerenziani G P; Franciosi E ; Meucci M ; Guidetti L ; Baldari C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/SMS.12310","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Gallotta M C, Emerenziani G P, Franciosi E, Meucci M, Guidetti L, and Baldari C (2015) Acute physical activity and delayed attention in primary school students..

aim of the study was threefold: (a) to test a before-school physical activity intervention (Active-Start) on academic performance, selective attention, and concentration capacity; (b) to test the effect of the Active-Start intervention on anthropometry, body composition, and physical fitness parameters; and (c) whether the physical fitness components are moderators of the effect of the Active-Start program on academic performance, selective attention, and concentration capacity in Chilean children. The Active-Start intervention was a RCT which comprised 170 children (8-10 years old) from three public schools with low socioeconomic status from the city of Santiago (Chile). The exercise intervention was delivered daily, before starting the first school-class (8:00-8:30 am) for 8 weeks. Changes in academic performance, selective attention and concentration capacity, anthropometric, body composition, and physical fitness parameters were measured. The analyses used were mixed regression models for repeated measures over time. No statistically significant changes in attention and concentration capacity were found. However, significant changes were seen in language (0.63; 95% CI 0.49-0.77) and mathematics (0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.66) performance (P \\u003c .001). Also, improvements were seen in fat mass, fat-free mass, muscular, and cardiorespiratory fitness (all P \\u003c .05). The Johnson-Neyman technique revealed a significant relationship between the effect of intervention and attention and concentration when change in cardiorespiratory fitness was above, but not below, 3.05 and 0.70 mL/kg/min, respectively. Implementing before-school physical activity programs such as the Active-Start to enhance the cardiorespiratory fitness may benefit attention capacity and academic success among schoolchildren.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"García-Hermoso Antonio ; Hormazábal-Aguayo Ignacio ; Fernández-Vergara Omar ; González-Calderón Nicole ; Russell-Guzmán Javier ; Vicencio-Rojas Francisca ; Chacana-Cañas Cesar ; Ramírez-Vélez Robinson ; Ramírez-Vélez Robinson ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/SMS.13537","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"García-Hermoso Antonio, Hormazábal-Aguayo Ignacio, Fernández-Vergara Omar, González-Calderón Nicole, Russell-Guzmán Javier, Vicencio-Rojas Francisca, Chacana-Cañas Cesar, Ramírez-Vélez Robinson, and Ramírez-Vélez Robinson (2020) A before-school physical activity intervention to improve cognitive parameters in children: The Active-Start study..

Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether there is an influence of extracurricular sports on executive functions and academic performance. However, it is less known which specific types of the sport better enhance executive functions in children; to investigate this issue, this study compared the performance on executive functions tasks and academic performance in one hundred and two boys and girls with an average age of 11.84 years recruited from Italian schools and gyms (N = 102), who participated in martial arts or team sports or were sedentary children. Executive functions were measured with the tests: Attenzione e Concentrazione, Digit Span test, Tower of London, IOWA Gambling task BVN 5-11, and BVN 12-18. Results demonstrated that children practicing martial arts showed better executive functioning and higher school marks than those involved in team sports or not involved in any sports. Furthermore, participants aged 12 to 15 years old outperformed in cool and hot executive functions tasks and had a better academic performance.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether there is an influence of extracurricular sports on executive functions and academic performance. However, it is less known which specific types of the sport better enhance executive functions in children; to investigate this issue, this study compared the performance on executive functions tasks and academic performance in one hundred and two boys and girls with an average age of 11.84 years recruited from Italian schools and gyms (N = 102), who participated in martial arts or team sports or were sedentary children. Executive functions were measured with the tests: Attenzione e Concentrazione, Digit Span test, Tower of London, IOWA Gambling task BVN 5-11, and BVN 12-18. Results demonstrated that children practicing martial arts showed better executive functioning and higher school marks than those involved in team sports or not involved in any sports. Furthermore, participants aged 12 to 15 years old outperformed in cool and hot executive functions tasks and had a better academic performance. Thus, the present findings supported the view that regular practice of extracurricular sports enhances executive functions development and consequently influences academic performance.","Comments":"MDE: This study has 3 arms: a) martial arts, b) team sports, c) sedentary/no activity.

Several sports demand an early start into long-term athlete development (LTAD) because peak performances are achieved at a relatively young age (e.g., gymnastics). However, the challenging combination of high training volumes and academic demands may impede youth athletes\\u0027 cognitive and academic performances. Thus, the aims of this study were to examine the effects of a 1-year sport-specific training and/or physical education on physical fitness, body composition, cognitive and academic performances in youth athletes and their non-athletic peers. Methods: Overall, 45 prepubertal fourth graders from a German elite sport school were enrolled in this study. Participating children were either youth athletes from an elite sports class (n = 20, age 9.5 ± 0.5 years) or age-matched peers from a regular class (n = 25, age 9.6 ± 0.6 years). Over the 1-year intervention period, the elite sports class conducted physical education and sport-specific training (i.e., gymnastics, swimming, soccer, bicycle motocross [BMX]) during school time while the regular class attended physical education only. Of note, BMX is a specialized form of cycling that is performed on motocross tracks and affords high technical skills. Before and after intervention, tests were performed for the assessment of physical fitness (speed [20-m sprint], agility [star agility run], muscle power [standing long jump], flexibility [stand-and-reach], endurance [6-min-run], balance [single-leg stance]), body composition (e.g., muscle mass), cognitive (d2-test) and academic performance (reading [ELFE 1-6], writing [HSP 4-5], calculating [DEMAT 4]). In addition, grades in German, English, Mathematics, and physical education were documented. Results: At baseline, youth athletes showed better physical fitness performances (p 0.05; d = 0.66-0.67), cognition and academics (p \\u003e 0.05; d = 0.40-0.64). Our findings revealed no significant between-group differences in growth rate (deltas of pre-post-changes in body height and leg length). Discussion: Our results revealed that a school-based 1-year sport-specific training in combination with physical education improved physical fitness but did not negatively affect cognitive and academic performances of youth athletes compared to their non-athletic peers. It is concluded that sport-specific training in combination with physical education promotes youth athletes\\u0027 physical fitness development during LTAD and does not impede their cognitive and academic development.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Granacher Urs ; Borde Ron ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/FPHYS.2017.00810","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Granacher Urs, and Borde Ron (2017) Effects of Sport-Specific Training during the Early Stages of Long-Term Athlete Development on Physical Fitness, Body Composition, Cognitive, and Academic Performances..

purpose of this study was to compare the acute effects of Aerobic Exercise (AE), Resistance Exercise (RE), and a nonexercise (NE) control on measures of academic achievement (AA) and cognition in 10th grade males and females. This study utilized a randomized crossover design. Tenth grade males and females performed three exercise trials (AE, RE, NE) separated by 7 days each. Immediately following exercise, participants completed a 10-question mathematics test, followed by the Stroop test. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed small but insignificant differences in mean math test performance between RE and NE, F(1,86) = 2.81, p = .098, η 2 = .032, and AE and NE, F(1,86) = 2.03, p = .158, η 2 = .023. Significant differences were found between RE and NE in the Stroop dot test, F(1,86) = 4.31, p = .041, η 2 = .048, and between AE and NE in the Stroop dot test, F(1,86) = 10.402, p = .002, η 2 = .108, and Stroop color test, F(1,86) = 6.85, p = .01, η 2 = .074. In conclusion, acute RE and AE did not significantly improve scores on a test of mathematics, but did improve measures of cognition in comparison to an NE control.

This study utilized a randomized crossover design. Tenth grade males and females performed three exercise trials (AE, RE, NE) separated by 7 days each. Immediately following exercise, participants completed a 10-question mathematics test, followed by the Stroop test. A repeated measures ANOVA revealed small but insignificant differences in mean math test performance between RE and NE, F(1,86) = 2.81, p = .098, η 2 = .032, and AE and NE, F(1,86) = 2.03, p = .158, η 2 = .023. Significant differences were found between RE and NE in the Stroop dot test, F(1,86) = 4.31, p = .041, η 2 = .048, and between AE and NE in the Stroop dot test, F(1,86) = 10.402, p = .002, η 2 = .108, and Stroop color test, F(1,86) = 6.85, p = .01, η 2 = .074. In conclusion, acute RE and AE did not significantly improve scores on a test of mathematics, but did improve measures of cognition in comparison to an NE control.

This study evaluated a multimodal classroom program\\u0027s (POWER) effect on fifth graders\\u0027 physical activity (PA) and executive function. METHODS Six 5th grade classes (3 = intervention [POW]; 3 = waitlist control [CONT]) in 2 diverse New Jersey schools participated. Data were collected before, during, and post-intervention. PA was assessed via accelerometer, executive function by NIH Toolbox, and academic achievement via standardized math tests. The POW principal, teachers, and select students participated in follow-up interviews. Group comparisons were made by multivariate repeated-measures ANOVA and linear regression. RESULTS PA decreased in both groups over time, but POW\\u0027s post-intervention class-time PA was significantly higher than CONT\\u0027s. POW\\u0027s NIH Toolbox score increased 3 percentiles more than CONT\\u0027s. Intervention fidelity was associated with significantly higher scores for one NIH Toolbox test. Student math test scores increased significantly for both schools, but there was no significant main effect for group.

. Successfully addressing childhood onset obesity requires multilevel (individual, community, and governmental), multi-agency collaboration. Methods . The Healthier Options for Public Schoolchildren (HOPS)/OrganWise Guys® (OWG) quasi-experimental controlled pilot study (four intervention schools, one control school, total N=3,769; 50.2% Hispanic) was an elementary school-based obesity prevention intervention designed to keep children at a normal, healthy weight, and improve health status and academic achievement. The HOPS/OWG included the following replicable, holistic components: (1) modified dietary offerings, (2) nutrition/lifestyle educational curricula; (3) physical activity component; and (4) wellness projects. Demographic, anthropometric (body mass index [BMI]), blood pressure, and academic data were collected during the two-year study period (2004-6). Results . Statistically significant improvements in BMI, blood pressure, and academic scores, among low-income Hispanic and White children in particular, were seen in the intervention versus controls. Conclusion . Holistic school-based obesity prevention interventions can improve health outcomes and academic performance, in particular among high-risk populations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hollar Danielle ; Lombardo Michelle ; Lopez-Mitnik Gabriella ; Hollar Theodore L; Almon Marie ; Agatston Arthur S; Messiah Sarah E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1353/HPU.0.0304","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hollar Danielle, Lombardo Michelle, Lopez-Mitnik Gabriella, Hollar Theodore L, Almon Marie, Agatston Arthur S, and Messiah Sarah E (2010) Effective Multi-level, Multi-sector, School-based Obesity Prevention Programming Improves Weight, Blood Pressure, and Academic Performance, Especially among Low-Income, Minority Children.

love to play games, and early childhood is a critical time for developing motor skills. This study combined gesture-based computing technology and a game-based learning model to develop a gesture interactive game-based learning (GIGL) approach that was suitable for preschool children. In this research, the ASUS Xtion PRO was used as a game-based device to build a virtual interactive learning environment for preschoolers. The aim of this study was to implement the GIGL approach to improve the learning performance and motor skills (namely, coordination and agility) of the participants. Based on a quasi-experiment involving 105 preschoolers (average age 5.5 years), the results showed that the participants who used the GIGL approach demonstrated better learning performance and motor skills than those who used the traditional activity game-based learning approach, and the statistics showed a significant deviation between the two approaches. Thus, this study provides additional evidence that using a GIGL approach is an effective learning method that improves both learning performance and motor skills to a greater extent compared with the traditional activity game-based learning approach. This study developed a gesture interactive game-based learning approach.It combined gesture-based computing technology and game-based learning model.A quasi-experiment with 105 preschoolers (average age 5.5 years) was conducted.Learning performance and motor skills (coordination and agility) were evaluated.This approach improved both learning performance and motor skills.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hsiao Hsien-Sheng ; Chen Jyun-Chen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2016.01.005","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hsiao Hsien-Sheng, and Chen Jyun-Chen (2016) Using a gesture interactive game-based learning approach to improve preschool children's learning performance and motor skills.

Gross motor activities were selected from Young Athletes, an evidenced-based gross motor pro- gram that provides detailed lesson plans to facilitate 2- to 7-year- old children's object control and locomotor skills as well as stability, balance, and bilateral coordination (Favazza et al., 2013). We sup- plemented gross motor lesson plans from Young Athletes with fine motor activities from the FingerGym curriculum (Brook et al., 2006). The FingerGym curriculum is a commercially available preschool and kindergarten school readiness program that targets fine motor skills, including visuomotor integration and manual dexterity.

This study used an experimental design to test whether participating in cognitively challenging motor skills activities was causally related to improvements in motor skills and two key indicators of school readiness: executive function and early numeracy skills. The motor skill program involved fine and gross motor game-like activities that were delivered in a small group format. Activities were socially engaging and progressively challenged children based on their motor competencies. Fifty-three preschool-aged children participated in 16 motor skill sessions across 8 weeks. There were significant treatment effects for all outcomes, such that children in the treatment condition exhibited significant improvements in motor, EF, and early numeracy skills, compared to their peers in the waitlist control condition. Treatment effects on EF skills were stronger for inhibitory control than working memory. Improvements in numeracy were most pronounced for children with initially lower levels of ability.

However, the mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects are poorly understood. Guided by the bioecological models of development, this study tested the indirect effects of participation in grade 8 in school sports or performance arts and clubs on grade 9 academic achievement, academic competence beliefs, and school belonging, via adolescents’ perceptions of their friends’ prosocial norms. Participants were 495 (45 % female) ethnically diverse students (mean age at grade 8 = 13.9 years; SD = .58) who were recruited into a longitudinal study on the basis of below average literacy in grade 1. Using weighted propensity score analyses to control for potential confounders, results of longitudinal SEM found indirect effect of participation in sports, but not of participation in performance arts and clubs, on grade 9 outcomes noted above. Implications of findings for improving educational attainment of at-risk youth are discussed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Hughes Jan N; Cao Qian ; Kwok Oi-man ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1007/S10964-016-0508-0","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Hughes Jan N, Cao Qian, and Kwok Oi-man (2016) Indirect Effects of Extracurricular Participation on Academic Adjustment Via Perceived Friends' Prosocial Norms..

Participants were 483 students (55% male; 33% Euro-American, 25% African American, and 39% Latino). Propensity score weighting controlled for potential confounders in all analyses. Delayed (Grade 8 only) and continuous participation (Grades 7 and 8) in sports predicted competence beliefs and valuing education; delayed and continuous participation in performance arts/clubs predicted teacher-rated engagement and letter grades. Benefits of participation were similar across gender and ethnicity; however, Latino youth were least likely to participate in extracurricular activities. Implications for reducing ethnic and income disparities in educational attainment are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: This is included for the Toolkit strand Physical activity.

Background: Regular physical activity (PA) plays an important role during early childhood physical and psychological development. This study investigates the effects of a 9-month PA intervention on physiological characteristics and motor and cognitive skills in preschool children. (2) Methods: Preschool children (n = 132; age 4 to 7 years) attending regular preschool programs were nonrandomly assigned to PA intervention (n = 66; 60 min sessions twice per week) or a control group (n = 66; no additional organized PA program) for 9 months. Exercise training for the intervention group included various sports games, outdoor activities, martial arts, yoga, and dance. Anthropometry, motor skills (7 tests), and cognitive skills (Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices and Cognitive Assessment System) were assessed before and after an intervention period in both groups. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. (3) Results: Body weight significantly increased in both groups over time. Compared to the changes observed in the control group, the intervention group significantly increased in chest circumference (p = 0.022). In contrast, the control group demonstrated an increase in waist circumference (p = 0.001), while these measures in the intervention group remained stable. Participants in the intervention group improved running speed (p = 0.016) and standing broad jump (p = 0.000). The flexibility level was maintained in the intervention group, while a significant decrease was observed in the control group (p = 0.010). Children from the intervention group demonstrated progress in the bent-arm hang test (p = 0.001), unlike the control group subjects. Varied improvements in cognitive skills were observed for different variables in both intervention and control groups, with no robust evidence for PA-intervention-related improvements. (4) Conclusions: Preschool children’s participation in a preschool PA intervention improves their motor skills.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jaksic Damjan ; Mandic Sandra ; Maksimovic Nebojsa ; Milosevic Zoran ; Roklicer Roberto ; Vukovic Jovan ; Pocek Suncica ; Lakicevic Nemanja ; Bianco Antonino ; Cassar Samuel ; Drid Patrik ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH17186609","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jaksic Damjan, Mandic Sandra, Maksimovic Nebojsa, Milosevic Zoran, Roklicer Roberto, Vukovic Jovan, Pocek Suncica, Lakicevic Nemanja, Bianco Antonino, Cassar Samuel, and Drid Patrik (2020) Effects of a Nine-Month Physical Activity Intervention on Morphological Characteristics and Motor and Cognitive Skills of Preschool Children..

The purpose of this study was to gain insight into acute effects of a short physical activity bout on selective attention in primary school children, specifically in the school setting. Methods Hundred and twenty three 10-11 years old children, 49.6% girls, engaged in four experimental breaks in random order: 1 h of regular cognitive school tasks followed by a 15 min episode with the following conditions 1) 'no break' (continuing a cognitive task), 2) passive break (listening to a story), 3) moderate intensity physical activity break (jogging, passing, dribbling) and 4) vigorous intensity physical activity break (running, jumping, skipping). Selective attention in the classroom was assessed by the TEA-Ch test before and after the 15 min break in each condition. Results After the passive break, the moderate intensity physical activity break and the vigorous intensity physical activity break attention scores were significantly better (p < 0.001) than after the 'no break' condition. Attention scores were best after the moderate intensity physical activity break (difference with no break = -0.59 s/target, 95% CI: -0.70; -0.49). Conclusion The results show a significant positive effect of both a passive break as well as a physical activity break on selective attention, with the largest effect of a moderate intensity physical activity break. This suggests that schools could implement a moderate intensity physical activity break during the school day to optimize attention levels and thereby improve school performance.

Please compare passive break group vs. vigorous intensity PA break.

Exercise has received increasing attention for its beneficial physical and mental health effects on the development of preschool children. This study investigated the effects of diverse exercise on the cognition of preschool children. Two classes were randomly selected from kindergarten classes of children aged 5–6 years, and designated as the experimental and control classes. Each class contained 20 children (10 boys and 10 girls) according to the kindergarten class system. The experimental class completed exercises according to the designed curriculum, while control class carried out exercises according to the regular teaching plan, for a study period of 12 weeks. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the Mental Health Questionnaire for Children were used to assess outcomes, both at the beginning and end of study. After 12 weeks, the experimental class has improved in the “Object Assembly,” “Block Design,” “Picture Completion,” and “Coding” (14.70 ± 2.14, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 14.54 ± 1.56, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 9.62 ± 2.06, p &amp;lt; 0.05; 15.92 ± 2.72, p &amp;lt; 0.05) in performance test, and showed improvements in the “Movement,” “Cognitive Ability,” “Sociality” and “Living Habits” (5.65 ± 0.59, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 11.20 ± 1.91, p &amp;lt; 0.05; 9.05 ± 1.72, p &amp;lt; 0.05; 7.10 ± 1.45, p &amp;lt; 0.05) in mental health outcomes. Diverse exercise has a significantly beneficial role in promoting the cognitive development of children aged 5–6 years, as well as a beneficial, albeit insignificant, role in their mental health.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jia Ningxin ; Zhang Xijin ; Wang Xu ; Dong Xiaosheng ; Zhou Yanan ; Ding Meng ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3389/fpsyg.2021.759351","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jia Ningxin, Zhang Xijin, Wang Xu, Dong Xiaosheng, Zhou Yanan, and Ding Meng (2021) The Effects of Diverse Exercise on Cognition and Mental Health of Children Aged 5–6 Years: A Controlled Trial.

play is a novel approach to addressing low physical activity levels and fundamental movement skills (FMS) in childhood and new interventions must be developed and evaluated. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a 10-week school-based ‘active play’ intervention, and present preliminary findings on four outcomes: physical activity levels, FMS, inhibition, and maths fluency. This was a feasibility cluster RCT in which eight schools (one primary three class per school) were paired and randomly allocated to either the 10-week intervention (n = 4) or waiting-list control (n = 4). The active play intervention consisted of a 1-h outdoor physical activity session per week, incorporating 30 min of facilitated games and 30 min of free play. Feasibility measures were gathered using appropriate methods and physical activity was measured using an ActiGraph GT3X accelerometer, FMS were assessed using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2), inhibition was measured using a Flanker Test and maths fluency was assessed using the One Minute Basic Number Facts Test. Sixty-six percent of eligible children (n = 137) agreed to participate in the research. No schools withdrew from the study and three participants were lost to follow-up. Compliance to the intervention was high—none of the participants missed more than two of the ten scheduled active play sessions. Data lost to follow-up were minimal; most were lost (14%) for school day physical activity. Active play sessions were shorter than planned on average by 10 min, and participants spent a mean of 39.4% (14.2) of the session time in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). There was preliminary evidence of a small intervention effect on MVPA (d = 0.3), FMS score (d = 0.4), inhibition (fish trial: d = 0.1, arrow trial d = 0.1) and maths fluency (addition: d = 0.3, subtraction: d = 0.1). The active play intervention was feasible and benefitted from a relatively high MVPA content; however, preliminary findings suggest the intervention had a small effect on the outcomes. Having more active play sessions per week and/or extending the duration of the intervention may increase the effects and these should be tested before a future definitive cluster RCT is undertaken. This trial was registered on the International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trials Number register (ISRCTN) in August 2017 (\\n ISRCTN11607781\\n ).","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Johnstone Avril ; Hughes Adrienne R; Bonnar Lizann ; Booth Josephine ; Reilly John J; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1186/S40814-019-0427-4","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Johnstone Avril, Hughes Adrienne R, Bonnar Lizann, Booth Josephine, and Reilly John J (2019) An active play intervention to improve physical activity and fundamental movement skills in children of low socio-economic status: feasibility cluster randomised controlled trial.

present study investigated the prevalence of a primary reflex (the Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex) in children attending ordinary primary school and how this related to attainments in a number of academic areas. The effectiveness of a specific movement intervention programme in reducing primary reflex persistence and improving academic attainment was also evaluated.\\r\\n\\r\\nA comparative study of the progress of 683 children over a two-year period from Years 3 and 5, who completed an intervention programme known as Primary Movement, was carried out using the relative attainments of children at the same schools and standardised scores as baseline and follow-up measures. A second, quasi-experimental study followed the progress of four parallel groups in each of two large schools with the experimental side completing the movement intervention programme while the other side acted as the control.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was found that ATNR persistence was significantly associated with level of attainments in reading, spelling and mathematics and that boys were more at risk than girls for ATNR persistence. In both studies, it was found that the movement intervention programme had a very significant impact on reducing the levels of ATNR persistence in children and that this was associated with very significant improvements in reading and mathematics, in particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis research provides further evidence of a link between the attainment of core educational skills and the interference that may result from an underlying developmental deficit. The effectiveness of the intervention programme in reducing ATNR persistence and in increasing academic attainments suggests that this programme could be used to complement other strategies that have been shown to have a positive effect on children\\u0027s learning.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Jordan-Black Julie-Anne ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/J.1471-3802.2005.00049.X","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Jordan-Black Julie-Anne (2005) The effects of the Primary Movement programme on the academic performance of children attending ordinary primary school.

the emerging body of research on the potential of physical activity to improve learning and academic achievement, conclusive evidence regarding the effects of physical activity on academic achievement is lacking. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of a physical activity intervention program on academic performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMETHODS\\r\\nA controlled cross-sectional design was used to investigate the hypothesis that the intervention program would increase the proportion of students in grade 5 who achieved the national learning goals in Swedish, mathematics, and English compared with 3 reference schools. Academic results from the years prior to and during the intervention program were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses assessed the odds of achieving the national learning goals when the intervention program was integrated into the elementary curricula.\\r\\n\\r\\nRESULTS\\r\\nHigher proportions of students in the intervention school achieved the national goals in all 3 subjects compared with the reference schools after initiation of the intervention program. The odds for achieving the national learning goals in the intervention school increased 2-fold (p \\u003c .05), whereas these odds either did not change or decreased in the reference schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCLUSION\\r\\nPromoting physical activity in school by means of a curriculum-based intervention program may improve children\\u0027s educational outcome.","Comments":"ESDE: Please convert the odds ratio (and CI) using Psychometrika (option 14 14).","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Käll Lina B; Nilsson Michael ; Lindén Thomas ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/JOSH.12179","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Käll Lina B, Nilsson Michael, and Lindén Thomas (2014) The impact of a physical activity intervention program on academic achievement in a Swedish elementary school setting.

Materials and Methods: The study started with 800 adolescent students; 159 high-stress students and 142 low-stress students were selected on the basis of scores obtained through Stress Battery. Experimental group and control group were given pre test in three subjects, i.e., Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. A yoga module consisting of yoga asanas, pranayama, meditation, and a value orientation program was administered on experimental group for 7 weeks. The experimental and control groups were post-tested for their performance on the three subjects mentioned above. Results: The results show that the students, who practiced yoga performed better in academics. The study further shows that low-stress students performed better than high-stress students, meaning thereby that stress affects the students\\u0027 performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kauts Amit ; Sharma Neelam ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.4103/0973-6131.53860","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kauts Amit, and Sharma Neelam (2009) Effect of yoga on academic performance in relation to stress.

Eighty-two adolescents (64 female), aged 14-19 years, were randomized to four groups over a 4-hour morning: (i) a group who fasted and were sedentary (F-S); (ii) a group who ate breakfast but were sedentary (B-S); (iii) a group who fasted but completed a 30-min exercise bout (F-E); and (iv) a group who ate breakfast and completed a 30-min exercise bout (B-E). Individuals completed academic and cognitive tests over the morning. Adolescents in B-E significantly improved their mathematics score (B-E: 15.2% improvement on correct answers, vs. F-S: 6.7% improvement on correct answers; p = 0.014) and computation time for correct answers (B-E: 16.7% improvement, vs. F-S: 7.4% improvement; p = 0.004) over the morning compared with the F-S group. The B-E group had faster reaction times for congruent, incongruent and control trials of the Stroop Color-Word Task compared with F-S mid-morning (all p \\u003c 0.05). Morning breakfast and exercise combine to improve short-term mathematical task performance and speed in adolescents.","Comments":"This study has 4 groups. A) fasted & sedentary FS, B) breakfast & sedentary BS, C) fasted + 30' exercise F-E, D) breakfast + 30' exercise B-E. Please focus in comparing results of groups B vs. D. Please treat group B as control and D as experimental.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kawabata Masato ; Lee Kerry ; Choo Hui Cheng; Burns Stephen F; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/NU13041278","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kawabata Masato, Lee Kerry, Choo Hui Cheng, and Burns Stephen F (2021) Breakfast and Exercise Improve Academic and Cognitive Performance in Adolescents..

there is great interest in the correlation between children’s physical activity and their academic performance. In this study, a pre-test/mid-test/post-test experimental strategy was used to avoid any disruption of educational activities, due to the random selection of children in each group. The experimental group was tested for eight months. We developed a methodology for innovative physical education classes and created a model of educational factors that encourage physical activity for children. The experimental group comprised 45 girls and 44 boys aged 6–7 years. The control group included 43 girls and 46 boys aged 6–7. Methods: Mathematical diagnostic progress tests were divided into two sections: tasks were allocated according to performance levels and the content as well as fields of activity and cognitive skills. The assessment of all areas of activity was based on student performance (unsatisfactory, satisfactory, basic, and advanced). Distribution of mathematical learning achievements by curriculum content: mathematical diagnosis was used to evaluate first-grade children’s mathematical knowledge and skills according to the five areas of the mathematics education curriculum: numbers and calculations; phenomena, equations, and inequalities; geometry, measures, and measurements; statistics and communication; and general problem-solving skills. The differences between the pre-test and mid-test results indicated that the number of children performing at a satisfactory level decreased (p = 0.035). The differences between the pre-test and post-test advanced (p = 0.038) and basic (p = 0.018) levels were found to be increased. Applying an innovative physical education program to first graders demonstrated a higher-level mathematics program in the areas of geometry, measures, and measurements; statistics; and communication and general problem-solving skills. Based on the interface between an innovative primary school physical education program and mathematics learning achievements, a research tool was developed that can be used in a quantitative research strategy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kliziene Irina ; Cizauskas Ginas ; Augustiniene Aldona ; Sipaviciene Saule ; Aleksandraviciene Roma ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/SU12124922","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kliziene Irina, Cizauskas Ginas, Augustiniene Aldona, Sipaviciene Saule, and Aleksandraviciene Roma (2020) The Relationship between School Age Children’s Academic Performance and Innovative Physical Education Programs.

While physical exercise training (PET) is undoubtedly very important for children and adolescents, there is still a lack of research dealing with the specific impact of different types of PET on cognitive and academic performance and the activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of two different types of exercise training on visuospatial processing and mathematical skills in adolescents with the analysis of cortisol. We randomly assigned 135 adolescents (12–15 years of age) into three groups: coordinative exercise (CE), cardiovascular exercise (CVE), and control (CON) group. Computerized cognitive test (matching grids), mathematical skills and salivary cortisol level were evaluated before and after 10 weeks of PET (three times per week for 45 min) after school. Reaction time of the matching grids task decreased in all groups while the accuracy was better in CE comparing to control. In addition, the CE group improved the mathematical skills. The participants who improved visuospatial performance had higher mathematics scores after the intervention. However, we did\\u0027t find any effect of the exercise training intervention on salivary cortisol nor on the link between cortisol and visuospatial processing.

The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of two different types of exercise training on visuospatial processing and mathematical skills in adolescents with the analysis of cortisol. We randomly assigned 135 adolescents (12–15 years of age) into three groups: coordinative exercise (CE), cardiovascular exercise (CVE), and control (CON) group. Computerized cognitive test (matching grids), mathematical skills and salivary cortisol level were evaluated before and after 10 weeks of PET (three times per week for 45 min) after school. Reaction time of the matching grids task decreased in all groups while the accuracy was better in CE comparing to control. In addition, the CE group improved the mathematical skills. The participants who improved visuospatial performance had higher mathematics scores after the intervention.

Many children suffering from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show problems in executive functions (EF), which reflect neuronal pathways from perception to controlled action. Treatment approaches that improve executive functions may prevent a negative cycle of failures in students. Hence, this research aims to study the efficacy of the perceptual-motor skills reconstruction program on EF in children with ADHD while considering cognitive flexibility, abstract verbal skills, response inhibition, and working memory. Also, its effect on clinical ADHD symptoms should be considered. Method: The research design included pretest, posttest, and a follow-up after six months. The sample included third-grade school children with ADHD (50 students, aged 8–10 years, boys and girls) who were referred to the Child Psychology Clinic, Iran, Mashhad 2018–2019. After clinical assessment for ADHD, children were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 25) and a waiting control (n = 25) group. The experimental group received the perceptual-motor skills reconstruction program for 16 sessions (three times per week, i.e., five weeks and one session in the sixth week). Delis–Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS) was applied at three measurement points (M1–3) in order to test for changes over time. Results: Data analysis (analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with post-hoc-testing) showed that there was a significantly better performance of experimental versus waiting control group at posttest (M2) and follow-up (M3) for cognitive flexibility (t(24) = 4.9, df = 14, p \\u003c 0.0001), abstract verbal skills (t(24) = 3.5, df = 14, p \\u003c 0.004), response inhibition (t(24) = 7.54, df = 14, p \\u003c 0.0001) and working memory (t(24) = 12.69, df = 14, p \\u003c 0.004). Further, Conners-Scales-Score improved for the experimental group. Conclusions: Training with perceptual-motor skills reconstruction program clearly improved the trained variables (i.e., cognitive flexibility, abstract verbal skills, response inhibition, and working memory) and clinical symptoms of the children with ADHD. The obtained training may lead in practice to better preconditions for successfully handling daily tasks at school and in society.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kouhbanani Sakineh Soltani; Rothenberger Aribert ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/SU13116210","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kouhbanani Sakineh Soltani, and Rothenberger Aribert (2021) Perceptual-Motor Skills Reconstruction Program Improves Executive Functions in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

In particular, executive functions that are closely related to learning achievement can be improved by acute and recurring physical activity. We examined the effects of a single 30-min physical education program in contrast to a 5-min movement break on working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition of attention and behavioral tendencies of eighty-one 13- to 14-year-old students in grade 7 in Germany. Results indicate that the maintenance of on-task attention in the face of distraction was improved by an aerobic endurance exercise-based physical education program but not by a short aerobic movement break. This suggests that the duration of a school sports program is decisive for improving students\\u0027 executive attention.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Kubesch Sabine ; Walk Laura ; Spitzer Manfred ; Kammer Thomas ; Lainburg Alyona ; Heim Ruediger ; Hille Katrin ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1111/J.1751-228X.2009.01076.X","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Kubesch Sabine, Walk Laura, Spitzer Manfred, Kammer Thomas, Lainburg Alyona, Heim Ruediger, and Hille Katrin (2009) A 30-Minute Physical Education Program Improves Students' Executive Attention.

The aim was to examine the changes in physical fitness and learning outcomes during the enforced period of lockdown caused by outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of schools in Italy. Thirty high-school students (14–15 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 15) that performed an at-home workout programme (~60 min., twice a week), or a control group (n = 15) who received only a regular programme of theoretical lessons where no practice takes place. Both groups were synchronized in real-time with the physical education teacher. In order to assess students’ starting level and significant changes reached, at baseline and after training, a battery of standardized assessment motor tests (Standing long jump test, Harvard step test, sit and reach test, and butt kicks test), and an academic achievement test (Amos 8–15) were administered. In comparison to the control group at baseline and the end of the programme, the experimental group reported considerable improvements in motivation and concentration, significant anxiety reduction, and an increase in capacity to organize studying and to be more flexible. Moreover, it was possible to observe the efficacy of the workout to improve learning ability among practicing students (p \\u003c 0.001). No significant changes were found in the control group. The results suggest that a school-based exercise programme conducted online could be a powerful approach in order to achieve the best academic outcomes and for improving students’ physical fitness as well as their cognitive health.","Comments":"Please compare the experimental vs. control group.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Latino Francesca ; Fischetti Francesco ; Cataldi Stefania ; Monacis Domenico ; Colella Dario ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/SU13115812","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Latino Francesca, Fischetti Francesco, Cataldi Stefania, Monacis Domenico, and Colella Dario (2021) The Impact of an 8-Weeks At-Home Physical Activity Plan on Academic Achievement at the Time of COVID-19 Lock-Down in Italian School.

Methods: This was a cluster randomised controlled trial conducted with 1200 students enrolled in the first year of high school. Schools were randomly assigned to: 1. Doubling physical education (PE) classes (3:20 h of PE/week); 2. workshop with the PE teachers; 3. workshop with the PE teachers and doubling the PE classes; and 4. control group (1:40 h of PE/week). We assured that the schools within the groups were equal regarding: The structural condition of the sports court; number of PE teachers; number of school classes; and the average number of students per classroom. Results: Overall, the intervention was not effective in improving the students’ academic performance. However, the subgroup analysis showed that the workshop intervention group increased the academic performance of students who had failed an academic year (from 16 years of age), compared to their peers in the doubling the PE classes (1.3 points on average) and the control groups (1.4 points on average). Conclusions: Enhancing the pedagogical skills of the teachers is a promising approach in improving the academic performance of students who failed an academic year.","Comments":"MDE: This study includes 4 groups: a) Doubling physical education (PE) classes; b) workshop with the PE teachers; c) workshop with the PE teachers and doubling the PE classes; d) control group.

A secondary aim was to explore potential mechanisms that might explain the intervention effect. Methods: The Activity and Motivation in Physical EDucation intervention was evaluated using a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial in 14 secondary schools located in low socioeconomic areas of Western Sydney, Australia. Study participants (n = 1173) were grade 8 students (mean age = 12.94 yr, SD = 0.54). The multicomponent intervention was designed to help teachers maximize students' opportunities for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during physical education (PE) and enhance students' motivation toward PE. Mathematics performance was assessed as part of national testing in grade 7, which was the year before the trial began and then again in grade 9. Potential mediators were: (i) proportion of PE lesson time that students spent in MVPA and leisure time MVPA (%), measured using Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers, and (ii) students' self-reported engagement (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive) during mathematics lessons. Mediators were assessed at baseline (grade 8) and follow-up (grade 9, 14-15 months after baseline). Results: The effect of the intervention on mathematics performance was small-to-medium (β = 0.16, P < 0.001). An intervention effect was observed for MVPA% in PE (β = 0.59, P < 0.001), but not for leisure time MVPA or any of the engagement mediators. There were no significant associations between changes in potential mediators and mathematics performance. Conclusions: The Activity and Motivation in Physical EDucation intervention had a significant positive effect on mathematics performance in adolescents. However, findings should be interpreted with caution as the effect was small and not associated with changes in hypothesized mediators.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Lubans D R; Beauchamp M R; Diallo T M; Peralta L R; Bennie A ; White R L; Lonsdale C ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1249/MSS.0000000000001730","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Lubans D R, Beauchamp M R, Diallo T M, Peralta L R, Bennie A, White R L, and Lonsdale C (2018) School Physical Activity Intervention Effect on Adolescents' Performance in Mathematics.

study explored whether Year 1 school children exposed to a 12-week classroom-based gross motor program progressed differently than Year 1 children undertaking their regular school program in motor proficiency, mathematics, and reading outcomes. Fifty-five Australian Year 1 school children (25 boys, 30 girls, mean age 6.77 ± 0.40 years) were exposed to either (i) their normal school program (Class N) or (ii) a 12-week program comprised of gross motor circuits and physically active: a) reading lessons (Class R) or b) mathematics lessons (Class M). Motor proficiency and academic performance in mathematics and reading were assessed using the Bruininks–Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (2nd Edition) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test—2nd Edition—Australian Standardised Edition, respectively. Differences in outcomes between classes following the 12-week program were assessed. Mean change scores for the mathematics composite were significantly greater for participants in Class R (9.61 ± 5.62, p = .001) and Class M (7.57 ± 5.79, p = .019) than for participants in Class N (0.76 ± 8.00). Mean change scores for reading (11.54 ± 7.51, p = .017) and total motor composites (6.12 ± 5.07, p = .034) were also significantly greater for participants in Class M than Class N (4.47 ± 3.50 and 0.82 ± 4.38 respectively). A 12-week classroom-based gross motor program may be beneficial for motor skill development and learning in Year 1 school children. This pilot evaluation may usefully inform future experimental studies to further investigate whether classroom-based motor skill programs have a beneficial effect on motor proficiency and academic outcomes in children in the early years of primary school.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Macdonald Kirstin ; Milne Nikki ; Pope Rodney ; Pope Rodney ; Orr Robin ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/S10643-021-01199-W","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Macdonald Kirstin, Milne Nikki, Pope Rodney, Pope Rodney, and Orr Robin (2021) Evaluation of a 12-week classroom-based gross motor program designed to enhance motor proficiency, mathematics and reading outcomes of Year 1 school children: A pilot study.

seconds in the last 2 weeks\n(weeks 1 and 2 = ratio 20:40 seconds; weeks 3 and 4 = ratio 25:35 seconds; weeks 5 through 8 = 30:30 seconds;\nweeks 9 and 10 = 35:25 seconds; weeks 11 and 12 = 40:20

A randomized controlled trial was used with a control group (CG, n = 94), and an experimental group (EG, n = 90) that performed monitored C-HIIT at the beginning of physical education (PE) classes, during 12 weeks (24 sessions). The EG increased 14.2% in selective attention, 8.41% in concentration, and 15.5% in mathematical calculation relative to the CG after the monitored C-HIIT programme (all p < 0.001). These improvements are especially significant in inactive students (all p < 0.001), but there were no differences in memory or linguistic reasoning variables (p > 0.05). It is concluded that a 16-minute monitored C-HIIT programme applied at the beginning of PE classes improves some cognitive variables, especially in physically inactive adolescents.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Martínez-López E J; De La Torre-Cruz M J; Suárez-Manzano S ; Ruiz-Ariza A ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"DOI:10.7752/jpes.2018.03232","Keywords":"cognitive performance, HIIT, physical activity, physical education, secondary education.","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Martínez-López E J, De La Torre-Cruz M J, Suárez-Manzano S, and Ruiz-Ariza A (2022) 24 sessions of monitored cooperative high-intensity interval training improves attention-concentration and mathematical calculation in secondary school.

Eight childcare centers with 87 four-to-five-year-old children were randomly assigned across an integrated physical activity condition, an unintegrated physical activity condition, and a control condition without physical activity. Children learned the names and a typical animal from each of the six continents using a floor-mounted world map with soft toy animals. Both learning conditions with physical activities showed higher performance than the learning condition without physical activities on an immediate retention test, and on a delayed retention test administered five weeks later. In addition, children in the physical activity conditions (integrated and nonintegrated) enjoyed their learning method the most. Infusing task-relevant physical activities into the classroom and the learning task is discussed as a promising way to improve children's learning, enjoyment, and health.","Comments":"There are 2 PA conditions.

This study investigated the effects of physical activities that were integrated into a science lesson on learning among preschool children. A total of 90 children from seven childcare centres (Mage = 4.90, SD = 0.52; 45 girls) were randomly assigned across an integrated physical activity condition including task-relevant physical activities, a nonintegrated physical activity condition involving task-irrelevant physical activities, or a control condition involving the predominantly conventional sedentary style of teaching. Children learned the names of the planets and their order, based on the distance from the sun. For both the immediate and delayed (6 weeks after the programme) assessments, results showed that learning outcomes were highest in the integrated condition and higher in the nonintegrated condition than in the control condition. Children in the integrated condition scored higher on perceived enjoyment of learning than children in the control condition. Implications of integrated physical activity programmes for preschool children's health, cognition, and learning are further discussed. ","Comments":"This study has 3 conditions: integrated physical activity condition, a nonintegrated physical activity condition and a control condition. Please compare integrated PA vs. control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mavilidi Myrto Foteini; Okely Anthony D; Chandler Paul ; Paas Fred ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3325","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mavilidi Myrto Foteini, Okely Anthony D, Chandler Paul, and Paas Fred (2017) Effects of integrating physical activities into a science lesson on preschool children's learning and enjoyment.

However, many schools are failing to provide children with sufficient activity at school due to a crowded school curriculum. Physical activity interventions that integrate physical activity with learning is a way to enhance physical and cognitive benefits without loss of academic time. This study evaluated the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of “Thinking While Moving in English”, a primary school program that integrates physical activity into English lessons. Method: Two classes of Grade 4 students (n = 55, 10–11 years old) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 29) or control (n = 26) conditions. The program components consisted of 3 × 40 min physically active academic lessons per week, delivered over a 4-week period. The following measures were taken at baseline and immediate post-intervention: on-task behavior, cognition (inhibition and working memory), and learning outcomes (spelling and grammar). Results: Results revealed significant improvements in on-task behavior and spelling in the intervention group, compared to the control group. There were no observed improvements in cognitive outcomes or grammar. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the efficacy of physically active English lessons to enhance children’s educational outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mavilidi Myrto F; Lubans David R; Eather Narelle ; Morgan Philip J; Riley Nicholas ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3390/CHILDREN5080109","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mavilidi Myrto F, Lubans David R, Eather Narelle, Morgan Philip J, and Riley Nicholas (2018) Preliminary efficacy and feasibility of the \"Thinking While Moving in English\": A program with integrated physical activity into the primary school English lessons..

Participants (N = 120, Mage = 4.70 years, SD = 0.49; 57 girls) were assigned to one of the following four conditions: performing integrated physical activity (task relevant), performing nonintegrated physical activity (task nonrelevant), observing integrated physical activity, or conventional sedentary teaching (without performing or observing physical activity). Results showed that children who performed task-relevant integrated physical activity performed better than children in all other conditions. In addition, children who performed physical activity, either integrated or nonintegrated, reported higher scores for enjoyment of the instructional method than the two sedentary learning conditions. Implications for educational theory and practice are discussed.","Comments":"This study has 4 conditions.

A primary explanation for this is that anxiety-related thoughts occupy working memory resources during testing that cannot be used for test-related processes (such as information retrieval and problem-solving). The present intervention study investigated whether physical activity could decrease anxiety levels and improve maths test performance in sixth-grade children. (2) Methods: Sixty-eight children of 11-12 years from two primary schools in New South Wales, Australia were categorised as low or high anxious from their scores on a trait-anxiety questionnaire. After this assessment, they were randomly assigned to the activity break condition, in which they had to do several physical activities of moderate intensity (i.e., star jumps) for 10 min, or the control condition, in which they played a vocabulary game for 10 min. The outcome measures were children\\u0027s anxiety levels at the beginning, during, and at the end of the test, invested mental effort, perceived task difficulty and maths test performance. (3) Results: Results showed that regardless of the condition, low anxious students performed better on the maths test than high anxious children. No differences were found for any of the variables between the activity break condition and the control condition. (4) Conclusions: Although test anxiety was not reduced as expected, this study showed that short physical activity breaks can be used before examinations without impeding academic performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Mavilidi Myrto-Foteini ; Ouwehand Kim ; Riley Nicholas ; Chandler Paul ; Paas Fred ; Paas Fred ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH17051523","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Mavilidi Myrto-Foteini, Ouwehand Kim, Riley Nicholas, Chandler Paul, Paas Fred, and Paas Fred (2020) Effects of an acute physical activity break on test anxiety and math test performance.

This study examines the impact of a classroom-based physical activity intervention on primary school students’ academic outcomes and physical activity levels. Students (N = 283) from nine primary schools located in New South Wales, Australia were randomly allocated to a control (n = 5 schools) or Thinking while Moving in English (TWM-E) (n = 4 schools) conditions. Teachers delivered three 40-min physically active English lessons per week for six weeks. The control condition continued with the usual lessons. For both conditions, assessments occurred at baseline and post-test. The TWM-E group displayed improved on-task behaviour, and improved grammar and punctuation scores.

This study examined the effects of different types of classroom physical activity breaks on children\\u0027s on-task behaviour, academic achievement and cognition. Methods Participants were 87 Australian primary school students (mean age 9.11 ± 0.62 years), recruited from one school. Three classes were randomly assigned either to activity breaks only (n = 29), activity breaks and mathematics combined (n = 29), or control conditions involving only mathematical content (n = 29). Students were engaged in five minutes of classroom physical activity breaks, three times per week, for four weeks (divided into two minutes at the beginning of the usual mathematics curriculum lesson and three minutes in the middle of the lesson). Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-test. Results Significant group-by-time effects were found for on-task behaviour (active engagement: activity breaks and mathematics combined versus control, p ≤ 0.001; activity breaks versus control, p ≤ 0.001; activity breaks and mathematics combined versus activity breaks, p = 0.037; passive engagement: activity breaks and mathematics combined versus control, p ≤ 0.001) and mathematics scores (activity breaks versus control, p = 0.045). Conclusion Physical activity breaks with and without integrated mathematics content were effective in improving children\\u0027s on-task behaviour and learning scores.","Comments":"Coders: There are 3 groups: a) activity breaks only, b) activity breaks and mathematics combined, or c) control condition involving only mathematical content.

The majority of activities could be performed in the classroom (8/10), while students could work as a group (‘Curious Ball’, ‘To the wall’, ‘Over/under’, ‘Messed- up train’) or with a partner (‘Red light’, ‘Find your pair’). Only two activities could be performed individually (‘Jump the answer’, ‘Move around’). For example, in the activity ‘Find your pair’ (Figure 1), students were asked to perform one activity (e.g., skipping), collect a card scattered on the floor that included either a math problem or the answer to a problem and find the classmate with the matching card (answer or problem, respectively). The AB classes were offered a package of an equal amount of simple, easy- to- perform and safe activities (total of 10) of the most commonly used classroom- based activity breaks that were also freely available in the Web (e.g., Ref.14). The activities included fit- ness exercises (e.g., stations, use of deck of cards, 12 days of fitness, with movements like high knees, squats, planks, running in place), team games for a limited space (e.g., ‘hide and seek’ with jumpers and joggers for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ answers, triangle tag, freeze/balance challenges), as well as individual exercises like practising a dancing routine and stories in motion.

This 8-week intervention examined the effect of two different types of classroom-based physical activity on math performance in elementary school children. METHODS Students in 4th and 5th grade (N = 560; 32 classes, 9-11 years old) from six schools were assigned to integrated physical activity (Move for Thought [M4T], n = 221), activity break (AB; n = 134) and a control group (n = 205; usual instruction) for eight weeks. Students completed a standardised math test before and after the intervention. Programme fidelity was measured with a teacher daily log, recording the duration and frequency of the physical activity sessions. Linear mixed models were used for the analyses. Grade and gender were explored as moderators. RESULTS Move for Thought group outperformed AB (p \\u003c 0.001, d = 0.44) and control groups (p = 0.013, d = 0.38). However, subgroup analyses showed that these effects were evident only in Grade 4. No gender differences were found. Intervention fidelity showed that the classroom-based physical activities (M4T and AB) were used about every other day, with higher implementation among 4th graders. CONCLUSION This study indicated that integrating physical activity with mathematics has stronger effects on mathematics than activity breaks and traditional instruction.","Comments":"MDE: Please code for M4T+AB vs control.\nESDE: Use the adjusted mean differences in the text, rather than unadjusted means in the table.

Our systems of understanding, including higher level cognition, are rooted in bodily awareness which needs to be developed as a precursor to intellectual reasoning. Cognition is embodied, and this concept may offer a radical new way of improving school education by improving children’s systems of physical understanding. A new classroom physical intervention, called Move4words, based on embodied cognition, was developed for pupils aged 7–13 years and trialled with 348 typical pupils in 10 mainstream UK schools. Three pilot controlled trials showed significant improvements in academic performance, particularly for struggling pupils performing in the lowest 20 percent. Effect sizes were large for the lowest achievers: Hedges’ g = 0.86 for national examinations at age 11 (KS2 SATs) and g = 1.24 for progress through National Curriculum Levels in reading, writing and maths. Performance gains were maintained for at least 1 year after the end of the intervention.","Comments":"This paper has 3 studies.

in the classic ‘language areas’ such as Broca’s area, but also in areas which control movement. Our systems of understanding, including higher level cognition, are rooted in bodily awareness which needs to be developed as a precursor to intellectual reasoning. Cognition is embodied, and this concept may offer a radical new way of improving school education by improving children’s systems of physical understanding. A new classroom physical intervention, called Move4words, based on embodied cognition, was developed for pupils aged 7–13 years and trialled with 348 typical pupils in 10 mainstream UK schools. Three pilot controlled trials showed significant improvements in academic performance, particularly for struggling pupils performing in the lowest 20 percent. Effect sizes were large for the lowest achievers: Hedges’ g = 0.86 for national examinations at age 11 (KS2 SATs) and g = 1.24 for progress through National Curriculum Levels in reading, writing and maths. Performance gains were maintained for at least 1 year after the end of the intervention.","Comments":"This paper has 3 studies. Please code study 3 focusing on the effects immediately after the intervention's completion.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McClelland Elizabeth ; Pitt Anna ; Stein John ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1365480214562125","Keywords":"Concentration\nimproving reading\ninclusive classroom intervention\nmindful physical activity\nprimary school\nraising achievement","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McClelland Elizabeth, Pitt Anna, and Stein John (2014) Enhanced academic performance using a novel classroom physical activity intervention to increase awareness, attention and self-control: Putting embodied cognition into practice.

These programs have the potential to enhance success in other important contexts for children, such as school. However, rigorous examination of this potential impact is needed. Methods Propensity score matching was used to compare school outcomes among children who participated in a short, summer physical activity-based PYD program in the USA and children who were from similar backgrounds and from the same school district but did not attend the program. The sample included 149 pairs of students aged 7–12 years (M = 10.11, SD = 1.26) and, in each group, 62% were from ethnically diverse backgrounds, 38% were from primarily Caucasian backgrounds, and 80 were female and 69 were male, and birth years were equally distributed. Ordinal and logistic regression models were used to test for differences between standardized math and language arts test scores, excused and unexcused absences, and total suspensions and expulsions between the two groups. Results PYD program youth had 55% and 46% greater odds being in the highest math (χ2(1, N = 298) = 4.06, p = .04) and total days attended categories (χ2(1, N = 298) = 5.58, p = .02) respectively. No other significant differences were found. When using a more rigorous quasi-experimental and longitudinal design, participation in a PYD program predicted some but not all academic performance and behaviors. PYD programs may need to be designed to specifically nurture academic skills to consistently impact academic outcomes.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McDavid Lindley ; McDonough Meghan H; Wong Janet B; Snyder Frank J; Ruiz Yumary ; Blankenship Bonnie B; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.ADOLESCENCE.2019.10.012","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McDavid Lindley, McDonough Meghan H, Wong Janet B, Snyder Frank J, Ruiz Yumary, and Blankenship Bonnie B (2019) Associations between participation in a Physical Activity-Based Positive Youth Development Program and Academic Outcomes..

The program’s specific objectives were to teach students to (a)\nmove and freeze their bodies on cue, (b) use their bodies as instruments of\ncommunication, (c) create and dance fluidly a locomotive movement\nsequence, (d) say the sounds of letters or letter combinations they see, (e)\ndance/write the letter or letter combination that represents a spoken sound\nthey hear, (f) say the individual sounds of short-vowel words they see and\nblend them into one spoken word, (g) say the individual sounds of short\nvowel words they hear and write the letters that represent them, and (h)\nmanipulate sound symbols to change words into other words.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5372848,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"poverty-level[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215276,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 5:\n[¬s]\"Whirlwind implemented sev-\neral first-grade pilot programs in Chicago public schools.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"This study was\ndesigned to evaluate the impact of the BRD program on first-grade students’\nreading skills, compared to current instructional strategies used in a sample\nof Chicago public schools.\"\n\"This study of the BRD program was designed to\nassess the beginning outcomes ofreading acquisition for first-grade students.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215411,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"There were a total of721 first-grade students from Chicago public schools who participated in\nthe study, with 328 students from 6 schools receiving the program and 393 students from 9\nschools serving as controls.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"721","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"There were a total of721 first-grade students from Chicago public schools who participated in\nthe study, with 328 students from 6 schools receiving the program and 393 students from 9\nschools serving as controls.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215436,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215437,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"Six Chicago public schools that serve predominantly African American\npopulations from poverty-level families selected the BRD program as part of\ntheir reading curriculum, and all 16 first-grade classes from these 6 schools\nparticipated in the program[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215491,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 11:\n[¬s]\"The researchers administering the test participated in two training ses-\nsions to establish rater reliability (i.e., to ensure that they scored similar\nresponses in similar ways).[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 8:\n[¬s]\"Three artists, trained by Whirlwind, implemented the program, and each[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 9:\n[¬s]\"artist worked with five to six first-grade classrooms twice a week for 10\nweeks.[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"McMahon etal_2003.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215498,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919089,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 7:\n[¬s]\"This study was\ndesigned to evaluate the impact of the BRD program on first-grade students’\nreading skills, compared to current instructional strategies used in a sample\nof Chicago public schools.

Basic Reading Through Dance is a 20-session, curriculum-based reading intervention for first-grade students developed by Whirlwind, a not-for-profit organization. There were a total of 721 first-grade students from Chicago public schools who participated in the study, with 328 students from 6 schools receiving the program and 393 students from 9 schools serving as controls. The program was designed to improve reading skills, as assessed by the PhonoGraphix Test, such as code knowledge (alphabet sounds) and phoneme segmentation (separating letter sounds within spoken words). Results suggest that the students who participated in the program improved significantly more than control students on all reading skills that were assessed.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"McMahon Susan D; Rose Dale S; Parks Michaela ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1177/0193841X02239021","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"McMahon Susan D, Rose Dale S, and Parks Michaela (2003) Basic Reading Through Dance program.

relationship between physical activity in school children, academic performance and their perceptual-motor skills is unclear. The aim of this study was to look at the relationship between perceptual-motor and cognitive skills. 487 subjects (249 girls, 238 boys) from 6 public centres of primary and secondary schools in the Barcelona area (Spain) volunteered to participate in this study. The participants were divided into two groups (9-12 years old) and (13-16 years old). Four tests were used to evaluate cognitive (Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that TC and age were significant predictors of Linguistic Skills (LS) and Math Skills (MS) in both age groups. (R2=0.64, 9-12 years old) and (R2=0.45, 13-16 years old). The results from this study suggest that enhanced motor skills are associated with better academic performance.","Comments":"This study divides participants in 2 age groups (9-12 & 13-16) and 2 Physical activity (PA or no PA).

Over 8,800 schools worldwide have implemented The Daily MileTM (TDM), without any formal assessments of its impact. Rigorous and high-quality studies are needed to explore TDM’s contribution to moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) guidelines and potential impact on EFs and AP. Methods: Children (14 classes, n=303, age mean=8.99±0.5) from 11 primary schools already implementing TDM consented. At the individual level, children were randomly assigned using a 4-block process to either TDM or continued academic lessons (TDM n=158, control n=145). Children completed pre and post, EF tests (Trail Making Task; Digit Recall; Flanker; Animal Stroop) and a maths fluency test (Maths Addition and Subtraction, Speed and Accuracy Test). Accelerometers assessed MVPA using 15-second-epochs and Evenson cut-points. Results: Using multi-level modelling, TDM revealed significantly greater MVPA (+10.23 minutes) and reduced sedentary time (-9.28 minutes) compared to control (p≤0.001, d=4.92, 3.61 retrospectively). Maths fluency interacted with condition and time (p=0.031, d=0.25); post hocs revealed no significances over time (p\\u003e0.05). No differences in EFs (all p\\u003e0.05). Conclusions: This study is the first assessing the acute effects of TDM compared to continued academic lessons. TDM revealed no significant improvements in maths fluency or EF. These findings question justifying the widespread adoption of TDM based on enhanced cognition claims. Nonetheless, TDM may provide 10 minutes of MVPA, achieving a third of the daily in school recommendations to meet overall daily recommendations.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morris Jade L; Daly-Smith Andy ; Archbold Victoria Sj; Wilkins Emma L; Wilkins Emma L; McKenna Jim ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.PSYCHSPORT.2019.101583","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Morris Jade L, Daly-Smith Andy, Archbold Victoria Sj, Wilkins Emma L, Wilkins Emma L, and McKenna Jim (2019) The Daily Mile™ initiative: Exploring physical activity and the acute effects on executive function and academic performance in primary school children.

Purpose: This study aimed to assess the impact of a 6-wk “Maths on the Move” (MOTM) physically active learning program on primary school children’s physical activity (PA) levels and math performance. Methods: This was a randomized con\u0002trolled trial. Year 5 children’s PA was assessed using accelerometry for 5 consec\u0002utive school days at baseline and during the final intervention week (final sample: n = 97; mean age = 9.61 ± 0.29 yr; 52.6% female). Two math performance tests were used, one assessing mathematical content taught during MOTM and one assessing math’s fluency (Maths Addition and Subtractions, Speed and Accuracy Test). Both tests were conducted at baseline and after the intervention (week 7). Focus groups were conducted in week 7 with intervention children (n = 12), ran\u0002domly choosing an even split of children classified with preintervention low or high PA levels. Results: On average, during a typical 45- to 49-min MOTM lesson, chil\u0002dren obtained an additional 5 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA and 5.7 min of light PA counteracted by a reduction of 9.5 min of time spent sedentary compared with children who remained in the classroom (control condition). The math attainment test performance significantly improved over time for children in the MOTM com\u0002pared with the control (+6.1 vs +0.9, P ≤ 0.0001, d = 1.507). No significant improve\u0002ments were found in the Maths Addition and Subtractions, Speed and Accuracy Test total score. Seven emerging themes were derived from the child focus groups. Children felt the MOTM sessions resulted in social and environmental im\u0002provements, which improved learning during the sessions. Children described the MOTM sessions as enjoyable, fun, engaging, and invigorating—resulting in posi\u0002tive associations to learning and activity. Conclusions: Collectively, the findings identify that the MOTM program improves pupil’s PA levels and academic out\u0002comes and identifies pupil’s willingness, enjoyment, and engagement.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Morris Jade Lynne; Archbold Victoria S.

previous studies, the effects of physically active academic lessons on academic achievement have been shown. Less is known about follow-up effects and the effects for disadvantaged groups. The first aim of this study was to examine 7–9 months follow-up effects of a physically active academic intervention on academic achievement. The second aim was to examine the effects of the 2-year intervention for a subgroup of socially disadvantaged children. A cluster-randomized controlled trial with 499 children (113 socially disadvantaged children) from second- and third-grade classes was conducted. Children’s academic achievement was measured before the intervention started, after the first and second intervention year, and 7–9 months after the intervention ended. At the 7–9 months follow-up, the intervention group showed significantly greater gains in math performance in comparison with the control group. No significant follow-up effects were found on language performance. Furthermore, the lessons significantly improved the math and spelling performance of socially disadvantaged children after two intervention years. These children did not benefit more from the lessons than other children. In conclusion, effects of physically active academic lessons on math achievement persist when the lessons are no longer taught, and the lessons are an innovative way to improve the academic achievement of socially disadvantaged children.

Background Although breaks are essential to restoring cognitive and psychological conditions for learning, short breaks within school lessons are not established and the specificity of effects has not often been investigated. Therefore, the effects of a physical activity (Study 1) and a mindfulness intervention (Study 2) were investigated. Procedure By an intervention-control group design, the effects of daily 10-min physical activity (Study 1: N = 162, 4th grade) and mindfulness breaks (Study 2: N = 79, 5th grade) were implemented within regular school lessons over a 2-week time period to research the impact on attention, reading comprehension, and self-esteem. Results In the physical activity intervention children\\u0027s attention improved (attention-processing speed: p η p 2 = .05, attention-performance: p η p 2 = .03), and in the mindfulness intervention reading comprehension improved (p η p 2 = .08) compared to the controls. Results further indicated that self-esteem moderated the relationship between groups and attention improvement in study 1. Conclusion Classroom-based short physical and mindfulness breaks could support attention and reading comprehension, which are known to support overall academic success.","Comments":"This paper reports two studies.

has demonstrated associations between differing modalities of physical activity (PA) and behavioral and learning outcomes; however, little evidence exists in real world settings. To evaluate the effects of embedding high intensity interval training (HITT) and resistance training (RT) into physical education (PE) curriculum on PA, academic performance, and behavior in youth attending urban schools. Forty boys and 30 girls; ages 8-10 yrs. enrolled in an expanded public school supplemental learning program were assigned into one of three conditions using a pragmatic trial design: standard PE curriculum (n = 23), HITT (n = 25), and RT (n = 22). PA was measured using accelerometers; math achievement scores were conducted at baseline and post-intervention using the Math Knowledge Assessment (MKA); behavior was assessed using the Abbreviated Conners Rating Scale (ACRS) daily. Participation in HITT resulted in 1.86 additional vigorous PA minutes (p=0.04) and 0.76 additional very vigorous PA minutes (P=0.02) per session, but was not associated with increased moderate PA minutes compared to the control group. RT PA outcomes did not differ from regular PE. Participating in HIIT, but not RT, was associated with a 1.82-point improvement in math test scores compared to those in the same grade in the standard PE group (p=0.02). No group assignment was associated with behavioral ratings. Embedding HITT within PE has potential for improving vigorous PA levels and may affect learning outcomes in urban youth. This is consistent with prior studies which show how short bouts of intense exercise can improve cognitive outcomes.","Comments":"There are 3 arms: a) HITT, b) RT and c) control.

Both groups were administered Trails Making Tests A (TMT-A) and B (TMT-B) at 20- and 25-min post-treatment, respectively. Mixed design ANOVA tests with repeated measures examined differences between treatments on TMT-A and TMT-B performance and the modifying effect of sex. Students who completed the physical activity condition displayed a faster time to completion on the TMT-B compared to students who completed the sedentary condition (Mean difference = -6.5 s, p = 0.026, d = 0.42). There were no differences between treatment groups on TMT-A and no sex × treatment interactions (p \\u003e 0.05). This pilot study suggests that vigorous physical activity may improve executive control in middle-school students and adds to the existent literature that continues to examine the emerging link between physical activity and cognition in school-based settings.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Phillips David S; Hannon James C; Gregory Bradley B; Burns Ryan D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH16203949","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Phillips David S, Hannon James C, Gregory Bradley B, and Burns Ryan D (2019) Effect of Vigorous Physical Activity on Executive Control in Middle-School Students..

A pre-/post-test design with an intervention group and a control group was used. A sample of 40, 4- to 6-year-old pre-school children was selected and allocated to the two groups. The intervention group participated in a perceptual-motor programme while the control group received no intervention. The programme involved an hour session once per week, over a period of seven months and consisted of different activities to improve body awareness, gross and fine motor skills, coordination, balance, bilateral integration, locomotor skills and spatial awareness. Both groups were evaluated with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2) and the Junior South African Individual Scale (JSAIS). Co-variance of analysis adjusted for pre-test differences showed that the programme contributed significantly to improvement in the fine motor, gross motor and total motor quotients, while two of the subscales of the JSAIS also showed significant improvement. The Kinderkinetics programme was effective in the improvement of perceptual-motor abilities of these pre-school children, while also contributing to their school readiness on an attentive and cognitive level.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Pienaar Anita Elizabeth; Van Rensburg Esme ; Smit Adel ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.10520/EJC108959","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Pienaar Anita Elizabeth, Van Rensburg Esme, and Smit Adel (2011) Effect of a Kinderkinetics programme on components of children's perceptual-motor and cognitive functioning.

METHODS Participants were randomized to PA (n = 19) or sedentary attention control (n = 16) programs. Academic records, curriculum-based measures, and classroom observations were obtained at baseline, postintervention, and/or follow-up. Mixed models tested group × time interactions on academic records and curriculum-based measures. One-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tested for differences in postintervention classroom observations. RESULTS Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated a moderate effect within groups from baseline to postintervention on disciplinary referrals (PA: d = -0.47; attention control: d = -0.36) and a null moderate effect on academic assessments (PA: d = 0.11 to 0.36; attention control: d = 0.05 to 0.40). No significant group × time interactions emerged on direct academic assessments (all Ps ≥ .05, d = -0.23 to 0.26) or academic records (all Ps ≥ .05, d = -0.28 to 0.16). Classroom observations revealed that intervention participants were off-task due to moving at twice the rate of comparative classmates (F = 15.74, P \\u003c .001) and were off-task due to talking 33% more often (F = 1.39, P = .257). CONCLUSION Academic outcome improvements were small within and between groups and did not sustain at follow-up. Academic benefits of after-school PA programs for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and/or disruptive behavior disorders were smaller than neurobiological, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes as previously reported.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Ramer Jared D; Santiago-Rodríguez María E; Davis Catherine L; Marquez David X; Frazier Stacy L; Bustamante Eduardo E; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1123/PES.2019-0224","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Ramer Jared D, Santiago-Rodríguez María E, Davis Catherine L, Marquez David X, Frazier Stacy L, and Bustamante Eduardo E (2020) Exercise and academic performance among children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders: A randomized controlled trial.

To examine the impact of integrating physical activity with elementary curricula on fluid intelligence and academic achievement. Methods: A random sample of 3rd grade teachers integrated physical activity into their core curricula approximately 30 minutes a day, 3 days a week from January 2008 to April 2008. Noninvasive fluid intelligence cognitive measures were used along with State-mandated academic achievement tests. Results: Experimental Group children averaged close to 1200 pedometer steps per integration day, thus averaging 3600 steps per week. Children in the Experimental Group performed significantly better on the SPM Fluid Intelligence Test. Children in the Experimental Group also performed significantly better on the Social Studies State mandated academic achievement test. Experimental Group children also received higher scores on the English/Language Arts, Math and Science achievements tests, but were not statistically significant compared with Control Group children. Children classified in Fitnessgram's Healthy Fitness Zone for BMI earned lower scores on many of the SPM Fluid Intelligence components. Discussion: This investigation provides evidence that movement can influence fluid intelligence and should be considered to promote cognitive development of elementary-age children. Equally compelling were the differences in SPM Fluid Intelligence Test scores for children who were distinguished by Fitnessgram's BMI cut points. © 2010 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Reed Julian A; Einstein Gilles ; Hahn Erin ; Hooker Steven P; Gross Virginia P; Kravitz Jen ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1123/jpah.7.3.343","Keywords":"Health promotion\r\nPhysical activity\r\nPhysical education","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Reed Julian A, Einstein Gilles, Hahn Erin, Hooker Steven P, Gross Virginia P, and Kravitz Jen (2010) Examining the impact of integrating physical activity on fluid intelligence and academic performance in an elementary school setting: A preliminary investigation.

It may be that this is a moderated relationship in which active learning is beneficial for only some children. This paper examine the impact of baseline academic performance and gender as moderators for the effects of active learning on children\\u0027s academic performance. In the ASK-study, 1129 fifth-graders from 57 Norwegian elementary schools were randomized by school to intervention or control in a physical activity intervention between November 2014 and June 2015. Academic performance in numeracy, reading, and English was measured and a composite score was calculated. Children were split into low, middle and high academic performing tertiles. 3-way-interactions for group (intervention, control) ∗ gender (boys, girls) ∗ academic performance (tertiles) were investigated using mixed model regression. There was a significant, 3-way-interaction (p = 0.044). Both boys (ES = 0.11) and girls (ES = 0.18) in the low performing tertile had a similar beneficial trend. In contrast, middle (ES = 0.03) and high performing boys (ES = 0.09) responded with small beneficial trends, while middle (ES = − 0.11) and high performing girls (ES = − 0.06) responded with negative trends. ASK was associated with a significant increase in academic performance for low performing children. It is likely that active learning benefited children most in need of adapted education but it may have a null or negative effect for those girls who are already performing well in the sedentary classroom. Differences in gendered responses are discussed as a possible explanation for these results.

suggests that acting mindfully, that is, by stressing the purpose of the action and monitoring its current state, may benefit health, wellbeing, and academic achievements. We sought to investigate the underlying motor abilities affected by mindful-movement (MM) intervention, and which mediate its effect on academic achievement among kindergarteners. To this end, 160 children aged 3–6 years participated for 145 days, which included pre- and post-intervention tests of verbal and non-verbal intelligence, namely language, mathematics, and Raven matrices. The three conditions consisted of MM (integrating movement in academic learning), MS (movement-for-its-own-sake; promoting movement without promoting awareness), and control (regular academic environment activities). Results indicated that, compared to MS and controls, MM improved verbal and non-verbal intelligence. The effect on verbal intelligence was mediated through static balance performance, whereas the effect on non-verbal intelligence was mediated by dynamic balance performance. Possible mechanisms accounting for these mediation effects are discussed.","Comments":"MDE: Please code for MM vs control.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Rosenstreich Eyal ; Shoval Ela ; Sharir Tal ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1007/S10643-020-01150-5","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Rosenstreich Eyal, Shoval Ela, and Sharir Tal (2021) The effects of mindful movement intervention on academic and cognitive abilities among kindergarten children.

Schools were randomly assigned to condition: (a) Specialists taught the Sports, Play, and Active Recreation for Kids curriculum; (b) classroom teachers were trained to implement the curriculum; and (c) controls continued their usual programs. The Trained Teacher condition was superior to Control on Language, Reading, and Basic Battery. The Specialist condition was superior to Control on Reading, but inferior on Language. Despite devoting twice as many minutes per week to physical education as Controls, the health-related physical education program did not interfere with academic achievement. Health-related physical education may have favorable effects on students' academic achievement.","Comments":"Please code Cohort 1.\nESDE: Please combine the two intervention group gains using the Combining Means and SDs on Slack.

This paper also analyzed the mediator role of motor fitness between MOVI-KIDS and cognition. Methods Propensity score analysis of data from a cluster randomized controlled trial (MOVI-KIDS study). This analysis including 240 5-7 years old children from nine schools in the provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real, Spain. MOVI-KIDS program consisted of: (a) three weekly after-school sessions of recreational non-competitive PA lasting 60 minutes during one academic year, (b) educational materials for parents and teachers, and (c) school playground modifications. Changes in cognition (logical reasoning, verbal factor, numerical factor, spatial factor, and general intelligence) were measured. A propensity score cross-cluster matching procedure and mediation analysis (Hayes\\u0027s PROCESS macro) were conducted. Results All cognitive variables pre-post mean changes were significantly higher (P ≤ 0.05) in children from intervention schools than those from control schools (effect size ranged from 0.33 to 1.48). The effect of the intervention on the spatial factor and general intelligence was partially mediated by motor fitness (indirect effect = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.36; 1.65; and indirect effect = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.06; 2.62, respectively). Conclusions This study shows that a one-school-year multicomponent intervention consisting of a recreational non-competitive PA program, educational materials for parents and teachers, and school playground modifications improved the cognition of first-grade children. Further, our results suggest that the effect of the intervention on cognition was mediated by changes in motor fitness.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Sánchez‐López Mairena ; Cavero‐Redondo Iván ; Álvarez‐Bueno Celia ; Ruiz‐Hermosa Abel ; Pozuelo‐Carrascosa Diana P; Díez‐Fernández Ana ; del Campo David Gutierrez‐Díaz; Pardo‐Guijarro María Jesús; Martínez‐Vizcaíno Vicente ; Martínez‐Vizcaíno Vicente ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/SMS.13383","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Sánchez‐López Mairena, Cavero‐Redondo Iván, Álvarez‐Bueno Celia, Ruiz‐Hermosa Abel, Pozuelo‐Carrascosa Diana P, Díez‐Fernández Ana, del Campo David Gutierrez‐Díaz, Pardo‐Guijarro María Jesús, Martínez‐Vizcaíno Vicente, and Martínez‐Vizcaíno Vicente (2019) Impact of a multicomponent physical activity intervention on cognitive performance: The MOVI‐KIDS study.

However, empirical evidence for this claim is scarce and the role of cognitive engagement in enhancing children's attentional performance is unexplored in studies on physical activity breaks. The aim of the present study was therefore to disentangle the separate and/or combined effects of physical exertion and cognitive engagement induced by physical activity breaks on primary school children's attention. In addition, the role of children's affective reactions to acute interventions at school was investigated. Using a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design, 92 children between the ages of 11 and 12 years (M = 11.77, SD = 0.41) were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (1) combo group (physical activity with high cognitive demands), (2) cognition group (sedentary with high cognitive demands), (3) physical group (physical activity with low cognitive demands), and (4) control group (sedentary with low cognitive demands). Attention and affect were measured before and immediately after a 10-min intervention. ANCOVAs revealed that whereas physical exertion had no effect on any measure of children's attentional performance, cognitive engagement was the crucial factor leading to increased focused attention and enhanced processing speed. Mediational analyses showed that changes in positive affect during the interventions mediated the effect between cognitive engagement and focused attention as well as between cognitive engagement and processing speed. These surprising results are discussed in the light of theories predicting both facilitating and deteriorative effects of positive affect on attention.","Comments":"This study has four experimental conditions: (1) combo group (physical activity with high cognitive demands), (2) cognition group (sedentary with high cognitive demands),(3) physical group (physical activity with low cognitive demands), and (4) control group (sedentary with low cognitive demands).

In addition to physical health, daily physical activity’s benefits on the brain and cognitive functioning have been extensively researched and provide support for incorporating more physical activity into physical education and the school day. This research investigated the effects of physical activity on academic achievement in kindergarten children across the 2008/09 school year. The main hypothesis examined in the study was whether children who participated in the Interactive Physical Activity Center (IPAC) would perform better academically than the control group on the Dibels Oral Reading Fluency, Retell Fluency, and Group Mathematics Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation (G-Made) achievement tests. To ensure that children in the experimental group were physically active, participation, changes in heart rate, activity scores and perceived exertion were examined across the year. Third, school attendance was examined to determine if the experimental group had fewer school absences than the control group. A longitudinal non-equivalent control group design was used to investigate the relationship between physical activity and academic achievement. To determine if the children were active in the IPAC, a one-way ANOVA examined changes in fitness variables. For the main question of the study concerning physical activity and academic achievement a two-way (Group X Time) ANOVA was used to compare academic progress of the experimental and control group. To assess school attendance of the two groups, a one-tailed independent samples t-test was used. Results demonstrated that kindergarten children who received the IPAC program increased their physical activity and reached the academic performance level of the control group by the end of the school year. The experimental group experienced a greater rate of improvement over time in three out of four of the Dibels subtests compared to the control group, and improved the same as the controls in the Growth Scale Value of the G-Made. These results expand previous research on the relationship between physical activity and academic performance in kindergarten children. Results of this study are important for administrators and teachers because quality physical activity experiences have the potential to impact cognitive, physical and academic outcomes in our schools.","Comments":"ESDE: Please code LNF as primary outcome.","TypeName":"Dissertation","Authors":"Shannonhouse Amy Kathleen; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Shannonhouse Amy Kathleen (2012) The effects of physical activity on academic achievement in kindergarten aged children. , University of Pittsburgh ."},{"Codes":[{"AttributeId":5023574,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5215227,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[]},{"AttributeId":5372849,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919558,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"RURAL[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Silva etal_2020.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215502,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919558,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"A SINGLE PHYSICAL EDUCATION SESSION IMPROVES\nSUBSEQUENT ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN RURAL\nSCHOOL STUDENTS[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Silva etal_2020.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215241,"AdditionalText":"","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919558,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"hirty-six students\n(14.9 ± 1.5 years) randomly carried out 30 min of PE, performed at 74.3 ± 11.8%HRmax, while a control group\n(CON) remained seated watching a movie[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Silva etal_2020.pdf","ItemArm":""}]},{"AttributeId":5215428,"AdditionalText":"36","ArmId":0,"ArmTitle":"","ItemAttributeFullTextDetails":[{"ItemDocumentId":919558,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 1:\n[¬s]\"Thirty-six students\n(14.9 ± 1.5 years) randomly carried out 30 min of PE, performed at 74.3 ± 11.8%HRmax, while a control group\n(CON) remained seated watching a movie,[¬e]\"","IsFromPDF":true,"DocTitle":"Silva etal_2020.pdf","ItemArm":""},{"ItemDocumentId":919558,"TextFrom":0,"TextTo":0,"Text":"Page 2:\n[¬s]\"Participants\nunderwent four experimental sessions in random order, a minimum\nof 48 hours apart.

However, few studies have evaluated the relationship between physical exercise and cognition in rural schools, where drop-out levels tend to be higher and academic achievement lower. Objective: To analyze the effects of a physical exercise class (PE) on subsequent academic performance of students, and how they felt during mathematics (MATH) and Portuguese language (PL) tests. Methods: Thirty-six students (14.9 ± 1.5 years) randomly carried out 30 min of PE, performed at 74.3 ± 11.8%HRmax, while a control group (CON) remained seated watching a movie, prior to the tests (PE-MATH; PE-PL; CON-MATH; CON-PL). Results: The PE-MATH group presented higher scores (5.3 ± 2.2) than the CON-MATH group (4.0 ± 2.2). The tests were completed more quickly in PE-PL (7.8 ± 3.3 minutes) than in CON-PL (10.5 ± 4.2 minutes). The number of correct answer per minute was higher in PE-MATH and PE-PL (0.52 ± 0.25; 0.64 ± 0.51) than in CON-MATH and CON-PL (0.35 ± 0.19; 0.41 ± 0.41). Furthermore, 38.9% of PE-MATH felt more focused during the test, while only 16.7% of CON-MATH felt more focused. During the Portuguese language test, 27.8% of CON-PL complained of greater apprehensiveness, compared to 8.3% for PE-PL. Also, 36.1% reported feeling fatigued during PL after PE, compared to 8.3% in the CON-PL group. Conclusions: PE improved the adolescents\\u0027 academic performance. Despite feeling fatigue, more students who performed physical exercise felt less apprehensive and more focused during the tests after PE. Level of evidence I; STARD: studies of diagnostic accuracy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Silva Eva Kamila Pinto; Ramos Isabela Almeida; Brandão Pierre Soares; Pereira Raiane Maiara dos Santos; Brito Stéphany Vieira; de Moraes José Fernando Vila Nova; Arsa Gisela ; Atlas Steve ; Rasul Ammar ; de Oliveira Castro Henrique; Lewis John Eugene; Simões Herbert Gustavo; Campbell Carmen Sílvia Grubert; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1590/1517-8692202026062019_0006","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Silva Eva Kamila Pinto, Ramos Isabela Almeida, Brandão Pierre Soares, Pereira Raiane Maiara dos Santos, Brito Stéphany Vieira, de Moraes José Fernando Vila Nova, Arsa Gisela, Atlas Steve, Rasul Ammar, de Oliveira Castro Henrique, Lewis John Eugene, Simões Herbert Gustavo, and Campbell Carmen Sílvia Grubert (2020) UMA ÚNICA AULA DE EDUCAÇÃO FÍSICA MELHORA O DESEMPENHO ACADÊMICO SUBSEQUENTE EM ESTUDANTES DE ESCOLA RURAL.

However, due to barriers such as lack of time and resources many teachers are not implementing classroom PA to the degree they would like to. One innovative solution is to integrate classroom PA into academic concepts. Based on self-determination theory, this pilot study evaluated the effectiveness of a teacher-developed purposeful movement teaching strategy on PA, on-task behavior and academic achievement. Two third grade classrooms participated in this pilot study, one acting as the comparison and the other working with the school Physical Education teacher to develop the active lessons. The evaluation consisted of accelerometers, direct observation, academic assessments and a write and draw activity to assess student perceptions. Significant improvements were found in steps achieved during math and on-task behavior. Findings reveal utilizing PA driven lessons is an effective teaching strategy.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Snyder Kailey ; Dinkel Danae M; Schaffer Connie ; Hiveley Seth ; Colpitts Amanda ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.21890/IJRES.24378","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Snyder Kailey, Dinkel Danae M, Schaffer Connie, Hiveley Seth, and Colpitts Amanda (2017) Purposeful movement: the integration of physical activity into a Mathematics unit..

physical activity interventions evaluating the effect on academic performance usually includes children. We aimed to investigate the effect of a nine-month, school-based physical activity intervention titled School in Motion (ScIM) on academic performance in adolescents. Thirty secondary schools in Norway were cluster-randomized into three groups: the Physically active learning (PAL) group (n = 10), the Don’t worry – Be Happy (DWBH) group (n = 10) or control (n = 10). Target dose in both intervention groups was 120 min/week of additional PA during school hours. Parental consent was obtained from 2084 adolescent students (76%). Standardized national tests in reading and numeracy was conducted at baseline and at the end of the intervention. We used linear mixed model to test intervention effects. We found significant intervention effects in numeracy and reading among students in both interventions when compared with controls. The mean difference in change in numeracy was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.9 to 2.5; Cohen’s d = 0.12) and 2.0 (95% CI: 1.4 to 2.7; Cohen’s d = 0.23) points in favour of students in the PAL and DWBH intervention, respectively. Similar results were found for reading, where the mean difference in change was 0.9 (95% CI 0.2 to 1.6; Cohen’s d = 0.06) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.9; Cohen’s d = 0.18) points in favour of students in the PAL and DWBH intervention, respectively. When conducting intention to treat analysis with imputed data the estimates were attenuated and some no longer significant. The ScIM study demonstrates that two different school-based PA interventions providing approximately 120 min of additional PA weekly over nine months, significantly improved numeracy and reading performance in 14-year old students compared with controls. However, the results should be interpreted with caution as the effect sizes reported were very small or small and the estimates were attenuated when conducting intention to treat analysis. Despite this, our results are still positive and suggest that PA interventions are viable models to increase academic performance among adolescents.

We performed three experimental observations (EO) implemented in everyday school settings to investigate the effects of physical exercise on attention, academic and prosocial performance. In the first EO we examined the effect of a long-term exercise intervention on these variables in 6th grade students at a single primary school. In the second EO, the same design was replicated at four different schools. In the third EO the effect of a weekly jogging lesson was examined. Compared to control classes with regular lessons results indicate that implementation of exercise had positive effects on concentration and social behavior, and that academic performance was not compromised replacing lessons by sports. In the light of these results, physical exercise should play a bigger role in school children's daily curriculum. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.","Comments":"This study has 3 experimental observations.

levels of physical activity among children have raised concerns over the effects of a physically inactive lifestyle, not only on physical health but also on cognitive prerequisites of learning. This study examined how objectively measured and self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior are associated with cognitive functions in school-aged children. The study population consisted of 224 children from five schools in the Jyvaskyla school district in Finland (mean age 12.2 years; 56% girls), who participated in the study in the spring of 2011. Physical activity and sedentary time were measured objectively for seven consecutive days using the ActiGraph GT1M/GT3X accelerometer. Self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen time were evaluated with the questions used in the “WHO Health Behavior in School-aged Children” study. Cognitive functions including visual memory, executive functions and attention were evaluated with a computerized Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery by using five different tests. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine how objectively measured and self-reported MVPA and sedentary behavior were associated with cognitive functions. High levels of objectively measured MVPA were associated with good performance in the reaction time test. High levels of objectively measured sedentary time were associated with good performance in the sustained attention test. Objectively measured MVPA and sedentary time were not associated with other measures of cognitive functions. High amount of self-reported computer/video game play was associated with weaker performance in working memory test, whereas high amount of computer use was associated with weaker performance in test measuring shifting and flexibility of attention. Self-reported physical activity and total screen time were not associated with any measures of cognitive functions. The results of the present study propose that physical activity may benefit attentional processes. However, excessive video game play and computer use may have unfavorable influence on cognitive functions.","Comments":"Please compare the objectively measured PA vs. control (sendentary) groups.","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Syväoja Heidi J; Tammelin Tuija H; Ahonen Timo ; Kankaanpää Anna ; Kantomaa Marko T; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0103559","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Syväoja Heidi J, Tammelin Tuija H, Ahonen Timo, Kankaanpää Anna, and Kantomaa Marko T (2014) The associations of objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time with cognitive functions in school-aged children.

Physical inactivity is an important health concern worldwide. In this study, we examined the effects of an exercise intervention on children’s academic achievement, cognitive function, physical fitness, and other health-related outcomes. METHODS We conducted a population-based cluster randomized controlled trial among 2301 fourth-grade students from 10 of 11 public primary schools in 1 district of Ulaanbaatar between February and December 2018. Schools were allocated to an intervention or control group with 5 schools each by using urban and mixed residential area stratified block randomization. The intervention group received a 3-minute high-intensity interval exercise program that included jumps, squats, and various steps implemented twice weekly over 10 weeks for 10 to 25 minutes per session. The control group received the usual physical education class. The primary outcome was academic achievement assessed by scores on the national examination. A linear mixed-effects model was applied. The difference between preintervention and post intervention was compared by least-squares means, estimated on the basis of the interaction of group, measurement time point, and school location. Only 1 statistician, responsible for the analysis, was blinded. RESULTS Of 2301 students, 2101 (1069 intervention; 1032 control) were included in the analysis. Intervention group members in an urban area showed an 8.36-point improvement (95% confidence interval: 6.06 to 10.66) in academic scores when compared with the control group, whereas those in a mixed residential area showed a 9.55-point improvement (95% confidence interval: 6.58 to 12.51). No intervention-associated injuries were observed. CONCLUSIONS The exercise program significantly improved children’s academic achievement.","Comments":"ESDE: Please treat the difference scores as gain scores (where the control group gain is zero as it is already subtracted), and calculate the SE or SD from the CIs - these must be based on the subtracted difference.

We conducted a secondary analysis of the Childhood Health, Activity, and Motor Performance School Study Denmark (CHAMPS-study DK), a natural experiment based on a trebling of curricular physical education, to investigate whether children receiving additional physical education performed better on their academic exams at the conclusion of compulsory education (i.e., 9th grade). Children from six intervention schools received 3-7 years of exposure to 270 weekly minutes of physical education (sports schools), while children from four control schools received the 90-min national standard (normal schools). Academic performance was based on the standard Danish 7-point scale (ranging from -03 to 12) and retrieved from national registries. The primary outcome was calculated as the average exam grade. Comparisons of participants at sports and normal schools were adjusted for individual socioeconomic factors and school-level academic environment. There were no differences in the pooled exam performance among 691 sports- and 510 normal-school participants (0.20 (95% confidence interval: -0.12 to 0.52)). Results for subject-specific exams indicated similar results. This analysis from a non-randomized natural experiment did not provide evidence that simply adding additional physical education is sufficient to affect academic performance relative to the national standard.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tarp Jakob ; Gejl Anne Kær; Hillman Charles H; Wedderkopp Niels ; Bugge Anna ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/CHILDREN8010057","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tarp Jakob, Gejl Anne Kær, Hillman Charles H, Wedderkopp Niels, and Bugge Anna (2021) Does Additional Physical Education Improve Exam Performance at the End of Compulsory Education?

Regular physical activity improves academic performance in children, yet the short-term impact of activity on test scores and related behaviors, such as testing anxiety, is less established. Laboratory research demonstrates a positive relationship, but the impact of activity before testing in the school setting remains unstudied. We assessed the impact of a moderate-vigorous intensity physical education (PE) lesson directly before reading/math standardized tests on 5th grade student test-taking outcomes. A cluster RCT design was employed within a highly diverse public school district. Fifth grade classes (n = 29) were randomized to a standardized 40-min PE lesson immediately prior to testing or control condition. After testing, teacher ratings of students’ classroom behavior during math testing were 12% higher in intervention vs. control classes (p = 0.047; Cohen’s d = 0.79). There were no overall differences in student reported test-taking anxiety between groups, though differences by race/ethnicity and sex were present; intervention African American students reported a more positive physical state on math tests (11% higher, p = 0.012; Cohen’s d = 0.51) and on reading (10% higher, p = 0.040; Cohen’s d = 0.40) tests, and lower overall test anxiety during the math test (13% lower, p = 0.018; Cohen’s d = 0.48) than controls. However, intervention boys reported more off-task behavior (4% higher, p = 0.040; Cohen’s d = 0.03) than controls. There was no difference in test scores between groups. Teachers felt the PE lesson may have been too vigorous, as it left some students perspiring and thirsty during testing. Further research is necessary to better understand the conditions under which physical activity prior to testing impacts student’s testing anxiety and behaviors.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Thompson Hannah R; Duvall Jessica ; Padrez Ryan ; Rosekrans Natalie ; Madsen Kristine A; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.MHPA.2016.06.002","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Thompson Hannah R, Duvall Jessica, Padrez Ryan, Rosekrans Natalie, and Madsen Kristine A (2016) The impact of moderate-vigorous intensity physical education class immediately prior to standardized testing on student test-taking behaviors.

activity is positively associated with physical health, cognitive performance, brain functioning and academic performance. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of bike desks in the classroom on adolescents’ energy expenditure, physical health, cognitive performance, brain functioning and academic performance. Methods:Forty-four adolescents were randomly assigned to control group (CG) or intervention group (IG). During 5 months, the IG used a bike desk for 4 class hours/week. Energy expenditure was measured during 6 consecutive days. Anthropometric parameters, aerobic fitness, academic performance, cognitive performance and brain functioning were assessed before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention. Results:Energy expenditure of the IG was significantly higher during the class hours in which they used the bike desks relative to normal class hours. The CG had a significantly higher BMI at T1 relative to T0 while this was not significantly different for the IG.

study investigated the effects of a high intensity interval training (HIIT) program on both physical fitness and executive functions in children. Fifty-six children aged 8–12 years participated in this study, and were divided into a HIIT group and a control group. The HIIT group performed three sessions of the 8- to 10-min HIIT program per week for 4 weeks. Before and after the intervention, 20-m shuttle runs, sit-ups, and standing long jumps were assessed as test of physical fitness. In addition, the executive function was assessed using the digit span forward (DSF) test, digit span backward (DSB) test, and Tower of Hanoi test. Only the HIIT group experienced significant improvement when completing the 20-m shuttle run (p = 0.042) and sit-ups (p \\u003c 0.001). Regarding executive function, the number of correct answers in DSB test significantly increased only in the HIIT group (p = 0.003). However, the standing long jump, DSF, and the Tower of Hanoi test performance did not change after intervention. The findings of the present study suggest that HIIT has positive effects on a core executive function such as working memory in addition to components of the physical fitness such as cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular endurance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Tottori Nobuaki ; Morita Noriteru ; Ueta Kenji ; Fujita Satoshi ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.3390/IJERPH16214127","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Tottori Nobuaki, Morita Noriteru, Ueta Kenji, and Fujita Satoshi (2019) Effects of High Intensity Interval Training on Executive Function in Children Aged 8–12 Years.

Purpose. To compare two intensity levels (standard vs. enhanced) of a nutrition and physical activity intervention vs. a control (usual programs) on nutrition knowledge, body mass index, fitness, academic performance, behavior, and medication use among elementary school students. Design. Quasi-experimental with three arms. Setting. Elementary schools, students\\u0027 homes, and a supermarket. Subjects. A total of 1487 third-grade students. Intervention. The standard intervention (SI) provided daily physical activity in classrooms and a program on making healthful foods, using food labels. The enhanced intervention (EI) provided these plus additional components for students and their families. Measures. Body mass index (zBMI), food label literacy, physical fitness, academic performance, behavior, and medication use for asthma or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Analysis.

in structured physical activity is assumed to have a positive effect on cognitive and academic performance. A single bout of moderate to vigorous exercise has been found to have a small acute positive effect on the cognitive performance of children and adolescents. However, the dose-response effects of exercise duration are largely unknown. Therefore, the current study examined the acute effects of moderate-to-vigorous exercise with a duration of either 10, 20, or 30 min on selective attention and working memory performance of young adolescents. One hundred and nineteen adolescents (11-14 years old) participated in a randomized, controlled crossover study. Adolescents were assigned to one of the three exercise durations, each paired with a sedentary control session of the same duration. Cognitive performance was measured before and immediately after the exercise and control condition. The Attention Network Test and n-back task were used to measure selective attention and working memory, respectively. There were no significant exercise effects on selective attention (i.e., alerting, orienting, or executive control) or working memory performance measured immediately after the exercise bouts. Furthermore, there were no differential effects of exercise duration. In sum, acute exercise bouts with a duration of 10, 20, or 30 min did not improve, but neither deteriorate cognitive performance of young adolescents compared to a sedentary control condition.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van den Berg Vera ; Saliasi Emi ; Jolles Jelle ; de Groot Renate H.

However, given the inconclusive evidence for the long-term effects of exercise, it is difficult to advice schools on what specific exercise programs can improve children\\u0027s cognitive performance. In particular, little is known about the effects of small exercise programs that may be feasible in daily school practice. Therefore, we assessed the effects of a 9-weeks program consisting of daily exercise breaks on children\\u0027s cognitive performance, aerobic fitness and physical activity levels. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 21 classes of eight Dutch primary schools. A total of 512 children aged 9-12 years participated. The exercise intervention had a duration of 9 weeks and consisted of a daily 10-min classroom-based exercise break of moderate to vigorous intensity. Before and after the intervention, we used four cognitive tasks (i.e., the Attention Network Test, Stroop test, d2 test of attention and Fluency task) to measure children\\u0027s cognitive performance in domains of selective attention, inhibition and memory retrieval. In addition, we measured aerobic fitness with a Shuttle Run test and physical activity during school hours by accelerometers. We analyzed data using mixed models, adjusting for baseline scores, class and school. After 9 weeks, there were no intervention effects on children\\u0027s cognitive performance or aerobic fitness. Children in the intervention group spent 2.9 min more of their school hours in moderate to vigorous physical activity as compared to the children in the control group. In conclusion, daily 10-min exercise breaks in the classroom did not improve, nor deteriorate cognitive performance in children. The exercise breaks had no effect on children\\u0027s fitness, and resulted in 2.9 min more time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity during school hours. Daily exercise breaks can be implemented in the classroom to promote children\\u0027s physical activity during school time, without adverse effect on their cognitive performance.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van den Berg Vera ; Saliasi Emi ; de Groot Renate H.

are tentative indications that physical activity (PA) during school time can be beneficial for children’s academic performance. So far, most studies have focused on the effects of moderate-to-vigorous PA, for example, in the form of energizers or extra physical education lessons. Little is known about the effects of physically active learning, in which PA is integrated with the academic content of the lessons, especially in preadolescent children. Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the enjoyment of physically active learning in this age group. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the effects of integrating juggling with math practice in primary school children, on (1) multiplication memorization performance and (2) enjoyment during the math lessons. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial, in which 312 children (mean age 10.4 years) from nine Dutch primary schools participated. Fourteen classes were randomly assigned to either a group that learned juggling whilst practicing multiplication tables (intervention group), or to a group that practiced the same multiplication tables while sedentary (control group). Both interventions had a duration of 5 weeks and consisted of 20 short lessons (4 lessons per week, 5 to 8 min). We used mixed-model analyses to examine the effect of the intervention on multiplication memorization performance. Group (control or intervention) was used as the fixed factor, and class and school as random intercepts. Analyses were adjusted for pretest multiplication performance, age, gender, general motor skill level, physical activity behavior (PAQ-C), and academic math performance. No significant intervention effect on multiplication performance were observed. However, the math-juggling program significantly increased enjoyment of children during the math lessons. We can conclude that the intervention did not improve, but neither deteriorated children’s math performance. The increased enjoyment in the math-juggling group can serve as an important starting point for structurally incorporating physical activities in the classroom setting.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"van den Berg Vera ; Singh Amika S; Komen Annet ; Hazelebach Chris ; van Hilvoorde Ivo ; Chinapaw Mai J.

Objectives This study evaluated the benefit of physically-active lessons for learning maths multiplication-tables. The impact of the intervention on general numeracy, physical activity (PA), aerobic fitness, body mass index (BMI) and school-day moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was also assessed. Design Randomised controlled cross-over trial. Method Year 3 students (n = 172, mean age 8.4 ± 0.3 years, 48% male) were recruited from 10 classes across two urban primary schools. Participants were randomly assigned to a seated classroom (Classroom) group or physically-active lessons in the playground (Playground) and crossed over to the alternative condition in the subsequent school term. The 6-week intervention comprised 3 × 30 min sessions/week. Multiplication-tables (teacher-designed test) and general maths (standardised test) were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Aerobic fitness was assessed via the shuttle-run. Pre- to post-intervention change scores were compared for analysis and effect sizes (ES) calculated. Total PA and MVPA were assessed with accelerometers in a subset of participants. Results Multiplication scores improved significantly more in Playground than Classroom groups (ES = 0.23; p = 0.045), while no significant differences were observed in general numeracy (ES = 0.05; p = 0.66). Total PA and MVPA were substantially higher during Playground than Classroom lessons (ES: total PA = 7.4, MVPA = 6.5; p Conclusions Physically-active lessons may benefit the learning of maths multiplication-tables while favourably contributing to school-day PA/MVPA.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Vetter M ; O’Connor H T; O’Dwyer N ; Chau J ; Orr R ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"10.1016/J.JSAMS.2019.12.019","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Vetter M, O’Connor H T, O’Dwyer N, Chau J, and Orr R (2020) 'Maths on the move': Effectiveness of physically-active lessons for learning maths and increasing physical activity in primary school students..

Objectives To assess the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-week pilot active break program (ACTI-BREAK) on academic achievement, classroom behaviour and physical activity. Design Pilot cluster randomised controlled trial. Methods 374 children in Year 3 and 4 (74% response) were recruited from six schools across Melbourne, Australia. Schools were randomised to the ACTI-BREAK intervention or usual teaching practice. The intervention involved teachers incorporating 3 × 5 min active breaks into their classroom routine daily. Academic achievement was assessed using 1-min tests in reading and mathematics; classroom behaviour at the individual and whole class level was observed by teachers; and physical activity levels were assessed using accelerometers. Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models were conducted using intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. Results Significant intervention effects were found for classroom behaviour at the individual level (ITT B = 16.17; 95% CI: 6.58, 25.76); effects were stronger for boys (B = 21.42; 95% CI: 10.34, 32.49) than girls (B = 12.23; 95% CI: 1.52, 22.92). No effect was found for classroom behaviour at the whole class level, reading, math or physical activity. PP findings were similar. Conclusions Implementing active breaks during class time may improve classroom behaviour, particularly for boys. There was no evidence to suggest that implementing active breaks had any adverse effect on academic achievement or classroom behaviour, which may encourage classroom teachers to incorporate active breaks into their routine.","Comments":"ESDE: Please use the PP analysis from Table 2. The beta will need standardising using the SD in Table 1. Reading as Toolkit Primary, Maths as a secondary outcome. An SE will need to be calculated from the CIs and then converted to an SE for the ES (these are proportional so can be found algebraically).","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Watson Amanda J.L; Timperio Anna ; Brown Helen ; Hesketh Kylie D; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JSAMS.2018.09.232","Keywords":"","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Watson Amanda J.L, Timperio Anna, Brown Helen, and Hesketh Kylie D (2019) A pilot primary school active break program (ACTI-BREAK): Effects on academic and physical activity outcomes for students in Years 3 and 4.

in sport and physical activity can improve academic outcomes and has been identified as a potential mechanism for addressing educational disadvantage and \\u0027closing the gap\\u0027 in Australian Indigenous communities. To explore this possibility in relation to sport and lifestyle we performed a cluster analysis on data from the Footprints in Time study (also known as the Longitudinal Study of Indigenous Children), using data from Waves 3-6 (2010-2013, ages 5-9 years) of this cohort study. Cluster inputs were organised according to not only sports participation, but also screen time, sleep duration and unhealthy food intake, as reported in parent surveys. Associations between lifestyle cluster membership and academic outcomes from standardised tests from 2014-5 (Progressive Achievement Tests [PATs] for Maths and Reading, and National Assessment Program for Literacy and Numeracy [NAPLAN]) were examined using linear models. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, remoteness and parental education. Three clusters were identified: Low Sport (36% of sample), characterised by low sports participation and low sleep duration; Junk Food Screenies (21% of sample), with high screen time and high intake of unhealthy foods; and High Sport (43% of sample), showing high sports participation and low screen time. Cluster membership was associated with academic performance for NAPLAN Literacy and Numeracy, and for PAT Maths. The High Sport cluster consistently performed better on these tests, with effect sizes (standardised mean differences) ranging from 0.10 to 0.38. We discuss the ecological dynamics potentially contributing to lifestyle cluster membership and ways in which policy can support healthier High Sport lifestyles associated with better academic performance.","Comments":"This study has 3 groups: 1) Low Sport (36%), 2) Junk Food Screenies (21%), 3) High Sport (43%).

Evidence of school-based physical activity (PA) on academic performance in children and adolescents was inconsistent, especially in high school students who face a high academic burden. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a strengthened physical education (PE) program on academic outcomes in Shanghai. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was conducted to investigate the effect of strengthened PE on academic scores by calculating the grade-cohort difference before and after the intervention. PE curriculum switched from traditional short duration (40 minutes) general fitness training to long duration (90 minutes) specialized sports (e.g., football, aerobics). A total of 460 high school students (236 pre-intervention and 224 post-intervention) were enrolled in grade 10 and followed for two and three semesters. The academic outcome was assessed by district-standardized test scores. A difference-in-difference approach was employed. Results: After two semesters, the standardized Chinese language scores and English language scores for the post intervention group were increased by 0.61 SD (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44, 0.78, p \\u003c 0.001) and 0.28 SD (95% CI: 0.09, 0.47, p = 0.01). However, the standardized math scores for the post intervention group were decreased in girls. After three semesters, standardized Chinese language scores for the post intervention group were increased by 0.27 SD (95% CI: 0.06, 0.48, p = 0.01). Math scores and English language scores decreased by 0.18 SD (95% CI: −0.36, −0.01, p = 0.04) and 0.23 SD (95% CI: −0.38, −0.09, p = 0.00), respectively. Conclusion: A school-based physical education program had mixed effects on academic scores in high school students.","Comments":"","TypeName":"Journal, Article","Authors":"Zhang Yunting ; Ma Xiaochen ; Zhao Jin ; Shen Hong ; Jiang Fan ; ","ParentAuthors":"","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH16234688","Keywords":"eppi-reviewer4","ItemStatus":"I","ItemStatusTooltip":"Included in review","QuickCitation":"Zhang Yunting, Ma Xiaochen, Zhao Jin, Shen Hong, and Jiang Fan (2019) The effect of strengthened physical education on academic achievements in high school students: A quasi-experiment in China..
