Thus, Tools teachers donot simply “let” children play, but use a play planning process\nas well as speciﬁc interactions to actively support children’s development of “mature” play in which pretend scenarios\nare complex, planned, sustained, and involve multiple roles.[¬e]""', 'Page 4:\n[¬s]""Dramatic play is a leading mechanism for the development of self-regulation, and Tools is similar to other constructivist and play-based curricula in room arrangement, materials, and the balance between small group, large group, and play activities. However, Tools differs from other curricular models in that the teacher actively supports the development of mature intentional dramatic play, while ensuring that each child is active in the selection of activities and the creation ofthe play scenarios (Bodrova & Leong, 2007). In Tools, the teacher helps children to write play plans, teaches children to plan their dramatic play together, and helps children to think about next steps during their play with the intention of fostering the development of self-regulation. Dramatic play contributes to the development of children’s self-regulation because it is an imaginary situation governed by social rules. While pretending to be a store clerk, the child must seek to behave in ways that meet the social rules for that role, curbing immediate impulses in order to think about how to represent how a clerk would act. Dramatic play leads to the internalization of rules and expectations and places demands and constraints on the child’s behavior. In thinking about the role while talking and acting the child is relying on private speech, while play plans provide an external support and children remind each other ofthe rules and roles thereby helping each other regulate their behavior. In addition, the extensive use ofsymbols (e.g., pretending a jar lid is the cat’s ball) develops abstract thought more generally.""\n""In Tools, the teacher’s role is not just to teach skills or facts, but to help children use tools and to learn to develop tools to facilitate learning. One ofthe tools expressly taught is the use ofexternal mediators to regulate behavior. In “Buddy Reading”""\n""The “Freeze Game” is another activity speciﬁcally designed to develop self-regulation and other abilities.

For example, socio-dramatic\nplay is considered to lead cognitive development during the preschool period. Thus, the curriculum calls for the use of toy\n?gures (animal or human) in each ofthe learning centers in the classroom to support children’s socio-dramatic play. To assess\n?delity ofimplementation regarding materials, a 50-item “environmental features” observation instrument was developed.\nThe scale measures the presence of materials for seven features: opening activity (circle time); play; equipment; classroom\nlabeling; books; writing; and socio-dramatic play. A criterion of 80% was established as “full” implementation for each\nfeature. Reliability scores of.85–.96were obtained prior to collecting data fromthe study classrooms. At the beginning ofthe\nyear, the Tools classrooms fully implemented three of the seven key environmental features. At years end, Tools classrooms\nfully implemented all environmental features except writing. Control classrooms did not fully implement any of the key\nenvironmental features at any time.""\n""Assessment of ﬁdelity regarding procedures focused on one particular activity that is common to many curricula, large\ngroup morning meeting (circle time).

Tools teachers are expected to pose questions to the group of\nchildren, rather than to speciﬁc individuals. Fidelity of implementation in this activity was examined using video tapes of\nlarge group meetings collected midyear.
