Using a nationally representative sample of Australian children, we describe the programmatic and teacher differences between different types of formal early childhood programs for children between 4 and 5 years old—pre-year 1, school-based preschool, standalone preschool, and center-based child care. We examine the child and family background characteristics that are correlated with selection into different settings and how these settings are associated with children's early academic skills and on their subsequent achievement. We focus on understanding if there are differential academic benefits accrued from each program type and whether or not these benefits persist into the early elementary school years. Results indicate that maternal employment and economic disadvantage are correlated with program participation and that pre-year 1 and preschool teachers have higher qualifications. Results also show that children who attended a pre-year 1 program held an initial, significant advantage in early academic skills compared to children enrolled in center child care. Center child care was associated with higher early math skills than preschools. Children who did not attend any early childhood programming lagged behind their peers in school readiness skills.

Is there a sustained affect of preschool education beyond the kindergarten or first grade level? Is one preschool program more effective than the other at preparing children to learn? It was the intent of this study to assist in answering these questions. The research design chosen for this study was a complex version of Campbell and Stanley's Posttest-Only Control Group Design. To meet the design a randomly selected study population was established. This population consisted of the following four groups  a. 20 Project Head Start program participants  b. 20 Title I Pre-School program participants  c. 20 children who were eligible for but did not participate in the Head Start program— (this group constituted the Head Start control)  d. 20 children who were eligible for but did not participate in the Title I Pre-School program— (this group constituted the Title I Pre-School control).

This overview describes the research design and discusses a variety of research issues (methodological and practical) in investigating the impact of pre-school provision on children's developmental progress.

This study compared the family of Jump Start programs and a comparison group on student academic performance. Participating in the study was one cohort of students from the 1996-1997 school year who participated in free lunch programs. Academic performance was assessed with the Stanford Diagnostic Reading and Mathematics Test total battery score. The Early Childhood Student Profile provided information on student cognitive/language/literacy skills, mathematics and logic skills, and language arts. The findings showed that the Jump Start program's KERA preschool and Head Start showed higher mean scores than the comparison group in both reading and mathematics. KERA's preschool had the highest scores for both reading and mathematics. An attendance analysis showed that the Jump Start class of 1996-1997 increased their attendance pattern from preschool to grade 3. Also, participants in the Jump Start programs made significant gains in the various dimensions measured by the Early Childhood Student Profile. (Contains 23 references.)

Subjects were 102 FYHS children and 39 non Head Start children. Data were gathered to assess the child's home background as well as his current school environment. A pretest and posttest battery of four instruments was administered to each child and five sets of observations were made in classrooms where subjects were enrolled. Results indicate that children attended markedly contrasting first year of primary school programs. Changes in intellectual functioning were complex and for the most part inconclusive. Difficulties in research design reflected problems consistent with comparative studies of this type. Rather than conclude that FYHS failed to affect a lasting change in children, this study points up the importance of carefully describing the different classroom environments and selecting appropriate comparison groups when attempting to evaluate the long-range effects of Head Start.

The primary purpose was to identify the learning outcomes after five years of exposure to Headstart. A sample of students enrolled in the Headstart Pre-School, school based program (Experimental Group) for the year 1968-1969, was identified and sub-divided into those  who were referred (Referred Headstart) for professional medical and educational reasons and those who did not need referral (Non-Referred Headsatrt). A comparable size sample of Non-Headstart children of same age and class grade were randomly selected for the control group. The total population was selected from a determined number of schools chosen primarily on the basis of having  Headstart students enrolled, having a racial balance of black and white students, greater than 30 to 70 percent, and a high mobility rate. Where this was not possible, equal samples were randomly selected from schools with  homogeneous racial groups. Schools were chosen based on the above criteria from the four elementary school districts  in Cincinnati's School System (Eastern Area and Eastern Central Area, Western Area and Western Central Area). Special or parochial schools were included as possible schools for use in this study. Data was obtained from four standardized tests (Myklebust, Devereux, Metropolitan, and Kuhlmann-Anderson) of written language facility, classroom behavior, achievement and intelligence.

During the summer of 1965, matched groups of 33 head start children and 33 non-head start children (control group) were studied. School pre-registration lists provided names and socio-economic information for both the head start children and the control group children. Both groups were tested during the two weeks between the close of head start sessions and the first day of public school. Scores on measurement instruments were analyzed on the basis of (1) sex, (2) mother's educational level, and (3) family income level. The measure of learning rate as determined by the seguin form board was the most consistent in showing differences resulting from head start intervention. The chief difference seems to be that head start experience aided a child in attacking learning tasks. Follow-up research is needed into health, social case work, effects on formal schooling, and evaluation and refinement of the program.

Before the policy, a typical child spent up to three years in pre-school, and four years in primary school. The reform reorganized the system so that pupils would spend two years in pre-school (at ages 4 and 5) and five years in primary education. The timing of national tests and of the incremental process of implementing the reorganization allowed us to use a DDD approach to make causal estimates of its effect on student achievement. The reform increased 5th grade students' mathematics scores by 0.10 SDs and reading scores by 0.12 SDs over student gains in untreated schools.

The article compares the characteristics and attainments of the pre-school sample with those of an additional ‘home’ sample (children who had not attended pre-school) recruited at entry to reception. Multilevel analyses of relationships between child, parent and home environment characteristics and children's attainments in pre-reading, early number concepts and language skills are presented. Duration of time in pre-school is found to have a significant and positive impact on attainment over and above important influences such as family socio-economic status, income, mother's qualification level, ethnic and language background.
