67322407,Arnold (2002),2002,"Teachers implemented a 6-week classroom intervention designed to promote emergent math skills and math interest in preschool-aged children. Teachers in experimental classrooms incorporated math-relevant activities into their daily routine during circle time, transitions, mealtime, and small-group activities. Control classrooms engaged in their typical activities. After the program, experimental children scored significantly higher than control children on a standardized test of math ability and enjoyed math activities more than the control children, as measured by both teacher and self-report. Teachers rated the program as highly satisfactory and reported that they increased their own enjoyment and skill in implementing math activities in their classrooms.

Mastery of these concepts is theoretically an important aspect of school readiness. The other half of the children engaged in the I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) exercises, a program designed to increase the children's competency in recognizing and responding to other people's feelings. The children who played the learning set games became superior at oddity and insertions with manipulable objects, and generalized these games to workbook-like formats resembling those encountered in kindergarten. They also scored higher on the numeracy and memory scales of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, indicating that mastery of oddity and insertions may have served as foundations for further cognitive growth. The children who participated in the ICPS exercises became superior at creating solutions to interpersonal problems, as measured by the Preschoolers Interpersonal Problem Solving Scale.

67322420,Kidd (2008) 1_1,2008,"Although many students who enter kindergarten are cognitively ready to meet the demands of the kindergarten mathematics curriculum, some students arrive without the early abstract reasoning abilities necessary to benefit from the instruction provided. Those who do not possess key cognitive abilities, including understandings of conservation, insertions into series, and the oddity principle, are at a disadvantage when attempting to master mathematical concepts and skills that require early abstract thought. Recognizing the need to address this gap, this study examined the effects of an intervention designed to teach children conservation, insertions into series, and the oddity principle. The study included 78 kindergartners enrolled in a culturally, linguistically, and socioeconomically diverse metropolitan school district. Students were randomly divided among one of three groups  cognitive intervention, numeracy instruction, and art instruction. Instruction for each group was matched in number, timing, and extent of sessions. The study found that kindergartners who received the cognitive intervention scored significantly higher on measures of cognitive ability than those in the comparison group who participated in the art instruction or those who received numeracy instruction. On the Woodcock-Johnson III Applied Problems scale, those in the cognitive intervention scored significantly higher than those who received art instruction. Those in the cognitive intervention and those in the numeracy intervention performed similarly.

74578012,Kidd (2008) 1_2,2008,"Although many students who enter kindergarten are cognitively ready to meet the demands of the kindergarten mathematics curriculum, some students arrive without the early abstract reasoning abilities necessary to benefit from the instruction provided. Those who do not possess key cognitive abilities, including understandings of conservation, insertions into series, and the oddity principle, are at a disadvantage when attempting to master mathematical concepts and skills that require early abstract thought. Recognizing the need to address this gap, this study examined the effects of an intervention designed to teach children conservation, insertions into series, and the oddity principle. The study included 78 kindergartners enrolled in a culturally, linguistically, and socioeconomically diverse metropolitan school district. Students were randomly divided among one of three groups  cognitive intervention, numeracy instruction, and art instruction. Instruction for each group was matched in number, timing, and extent of sessions. The study found that kindergartners who received the cognitive intervention scored significantly higher on measures of cognitive ability than those in the comparison group who participated in the art instruction or those who received numeracy instruction. On the Woodcock-Johnson III Applied Problems scale, those in the cognitive intervention scored significantly higher than those who received art instruction. Those in the cognitive intervention and those in the numeracy intervention performed similarly. These results suggest that it is possible to provide instruction that enhances the cognitive abilities of kindergartners who do not possess key reasoning abilities.

67322421,Klein (2008),2008,"Research indicates that a socioeconomic status-related gap in mathematical knowledge appears early and widens during early childhood. Young children from economically disadvantaged families receive less support for mathematical development both at home and in preschool. Consequently, children from different socioeconomic backgrounds enter elementary school at different levels of readiness to learn a standards-based mathematics curriculum. One approach to closing this gap is the development and implementation of effective mathematics curricula for public preschool programs enrolling economically disadvantaged children. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 40 Head Start and state preschool classrooms, with 278 children, to determine whether a pre-kindergarten mathematics intervention was effective. Intervention teachers received training that enabled them to implement with fidelity, and a large majority of parents regularly used math activities teachers sent home. Intervention and control groups did not differ on math assessments at pretest  however, gain scores of intervention children were significantly greater than those of control children at posttest.

Cognitive abilities, especially working memory (WM), play an important role in early numeracy, as well. Several studies have shown that working memory is related to early numeracy. So far, existing literature offers a good few examples of studies in which WM training has led to improvements in early numerical performance as well. In this study, we aim at investigating the effects of two different training conditions  (1) counting training  and (2) simultaneous training of WM and counting on five- to six-year-old preschoolers' (N = 61) counting skills. The results show that domain-specific training in mathematical skills is more effective in improving early numerical performance than WM and counting training combined. Based on our results, preschool-aged children do not seem to benefit from short period group training of WM skills.

In this project, theory- and practice-based methods intended to make mathematics meaningful for a group of urban African American children attending Head Start were investigated. The project had four main objectives  (a) test the comparative effectiveness of alternative forms of pedagogical methods designed to teach preschool math in a meaningful way  (b) characterize aspects of the cultural and mathematical landscape of children's home environments in a further attempt to understand what constitutes meaningful mathematics  (c) evaluate a measure of task-specific engagement for Head Start children  and (d) investigate the impact of different instructional methods on children's engagement during mathematics activities. Participants included 160 children (mean age = 61 months, 95% African American) attending 4 urban Head Start centers. Each child received a pretest mathematics assessment, two instructional sessions, and a posttest. Participating children were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 instructional conditions. In the first condition, participants received mathematics instruction with manipulatives based on a commercially available preschool numeracy curriculum. In the second condition, the mathematics was embedded in stories. In the third condition, movement was present during instruction (e.g., clapping while counting). The fourth condition consisted of an attention-control comparison group. ANCOVA analysis demonstrated a significant main effect for method of instruction when covarying for baseline math performance. The posttest performance of children in the movement condition significantly exceeded the performance of all other groups. Further analysis revealed that both conceptual and procedural use of movement during instruction related to posttest performance. Participants' caregivers completed questionnaires about mathematics and cultural attributes in children's homes. Caregivers endorsed a variety of reasons for why mathematics was important during preschool and select responses related to child attributes. The psychometric properties of a task-specific engagement measure were evaluated. For children instructed with movement, engagement remained constant across instructional tasks while the engagement of children in the other conditions varied by task.

We designed an intervention model based on that research, including mathematics curricula with an emphasis on teaching for understanding following developmental guidelines, or learning trajectories, and using technology at multiple levels. We then implemented that model and evaluated the implementation with a limited scale up study. Within a design involving 25 classrooms serving children at risk for later school failure, we examined the impact of the model, using measures of fidelity of implementation, classroom observations of mathematics environment and teaching, and child outcomes.

67322432,Sophian (2004),2004,"While mathematics instruction for very young children needs to be age-appropriate in format and content, it also needs to prepare children conceptually for the kinds of mathematics learning that will be expected of them in future years. This perspective, informed by the work of Russian psychologists and educators on a measurement-based approach to early mathematics instruction [e.g., V.V. Davydov, Children’s Capacity for Learning Mathematics, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Reston, VA, pp. 109–205], was the basis for an experimental mathematics curriculum which focused on the concept of unit as it applies to enumeration, measurement, and the identification of relations among geometric shapes. The curriculum particularly emphasized two ideas about units that derive from a measurement perspective  first, that the numerical result we obtain from counting or other measurement operations will depend on our choice of a unit  and second, that units of one kind can be combined to form higher-order units or taken apart to form lower-order ones. The curriculum included a weekly project activity conducted by the Head Start teachers, suggestions for supplementary activities, and a weekly home activity for a parent or other family member to carry out with the child. It was implemented with children in three Head Start centers (N=46  age range 2 years, 9 months–4 years, 7 months at the beginning of the program). To evaluate the curriculum, two assessment instruments (the mathematics subscale of the DSC and a supplementary instrument constructed especially for this study) were administered, at the beginning and again at the end of the school year, to these children and to two comparison groups. One comparison group (N=48  age range 2 years, 6 months–4 years, 7 months) received a literacy intervention rather than a mathematics one  the other (N=29  age range 2 years, 8 months–4 years, 7 months) did not receive any experimental intervention.

This study examines the effect of accelerating the early numeracy development of these children through remedial education, by comparing them with children with typically working memory skills and early numeracy abilities below average. Method Selected from a sample of 933 children, children with early numeracy ability below average are assigned into four groups  two intervention groups with limited working memory skills (IL-group) or typical working memory skills (IT-group), and two control groups with limited working memory skills (CL-group) or typical working memory skills (CT-group).

67322402,Tzuriel (1999),1999,"Bright Start (Cognitive Curriculum for Young Children  Haywood, et al, 1986, Haywood, et al, 1992) is an early education program designed to increase learning effectiveness and prepare children with the cognitive tools for school learning. Bright Start was systematically applied, for 10 months, with 82 preschool socioeconomically disadvantaged children while 52 children in a comparison group received a skills-based but not cognitively oriented program. Both static and dynamic assessment (Campione, 1989  Feuerstein, Rand, & Hoffman, 1979  Hay-wood & Tzuriel, 1992  Lidz, 1987  Tzuriel, 1997) tests were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program along with tests of task-intrinsic motivation and metacognitive activity. A follow-up study was carried out in Grade I to study the program's effects on cognitive performance and on achievement tests in Math and Reading Comprehension. Children in the experimental group improved their performance on different cognitive tasks and showed more task-intrinsic motivation and metacognitive behavior than did those in the comparison group. The cognitive scores on static tests and cognitive modifiability indices on dynamic assessment tasks were compared for each group at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up. Although lower at pre-test, the experimental group progressively closed the initial gap with the comparison group and showed superiority towards the end of Grade I. Achievement in Grade I Math and Reading showed slight (non-significant) superiority of the experimental over the comparison group, in spite of the relatively limited application of Bright Start, the emphasis on basic readiness skills in the comparison group, and the relatively higher initial cognitive level of children in the comparison group.
