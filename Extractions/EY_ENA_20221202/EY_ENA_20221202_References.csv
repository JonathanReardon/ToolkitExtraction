After the program, experimental children scored significantly higher than control children on a standardized test of math ability and enjoyed math activities more than the control children, as measured by both teacher and self-report.

The other half of the children engaged in the I Can Problem Solve (ICPS) exercises, a program designed to increase the children's competency in recognizing and responding to other people's feelings. The children who played the learning set games became superior at oddity and insertions with manipulable objects, and generalized these games to workbook-like formats resembling those encountered in kindergarten. They also scored higher on the numeracy and memory scales of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, indicating that mastery of oddity and insertions may have served as foundations for further cognitive growth. The children who participated in the ICPS exercises became superior at creating solutions to interpersonal problems, as measured by the Preschoolers Interpersonal Problem Solving Scale.

Young children from economically disadvantaged families receive less support for mathematical development both at home and in preschool. Consequently, children from different socioeconomic backgrounds enter elementary school at different levels of readiness to learn a standards-based mathematics curriculum. One approach to closing this gap is the development and implementation of effective mathematics curricula for public preschool programs enrolling economically disadvantaged children. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 40 Head Start and state preschool classrooms, with 278 children, to determine whether a pre-kindergarten mathematics intervention was effective. Intervention teachers received training that enabled them to implement with fidelity, and a large majority of parents regularly used math activities teachers sent home. Intervention and control groups did not differ on math assessments at pretest  however, gain scores of intervention children were significantly greater than those of control children at posttest.

In this study, we aim at investigating the effects of two different training conditions  (1) counting training  and (2) simultaneous training of WM and counting on five- to six-year-old preschoolers' (N = 61) counting skills. The results show that domain-specific training in mathematical skills is more effective in improving early numerical performance than WM and counting training combined.

In this project, theory- and practice-based methods intended to make mathematics meaningful for a group of urban African American children attending Head Start were investigated.

Participants included 160 children (mean age = 61 months, 95% African American) attending 4 urban Head Start centers. Each child received a pretest mathematics assessment, two instructional sessions, and a posttest. Participating children were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 instructional conditions. In the first condition, participants received mathematics instruction with manipulatives based on a commercially available preschool numeracy curriculum. In the second condition, the mathematics was embedded in stories. In the third condition, movement was present during instruction (e.g., clapping while counting). The fourth condition consisted of an attention-control comparison group. ANCOVA analysis demonstrated a significant main effect for method of instruction when covarying for baseline math performance. The posttest performance of children in the movement condition significantly exceeded the performance of all other groups. Further analysis revealed that both conceptual and procedural use of movement during instruction related to posttest performance. Participants' caregivers completed questionnaires about mathematics and cultural attributes in children's homes. Caregivers endorsed a variety of reasons for why mathematics was important during preschool and select responses related to child attributes. The psychometric properties of a task-specific engagement measure were evaluated. For children instructed with movement, engagement remained constant across instructional tasks while the engagement of children in the other conditions varied by task.

Research has shown that arithmetic difficulties later in life can be explained by an insufficient development of early mathematical competence  i.e. different aspects of early mathematical competence. The different aspects of early mathematical competence are derived from cognitive psychology and from a didactical point of view with an emphasis on (the various phases of) counting. The Piagetian operations (seriation, correspondence and classification) are used, however, as much as possible embedded in a counting context. After selection by way of an early mathematical competence test, children with a score below a criterium are presented with an additional program. This program consists of activities, embedded in real (daily) life themes, in which attention is paid to the different aspects of early mathematical competence. The program is given to the children with a guiding or a structuring instruction form.

Twenty children participated in three consecutive training sessions that were based on component processes underlying analogical reasoning. Trained participants consistently outperformed nontrained participants on the geometric analogy task, and the effects of that training were found to maintain for a 1-month period. It was also found that the verbal responses of the trained group reflected greater attention to the higherorder relations within and between pairs of terms in the analogy problems following training.",3,3,261–268,https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532690xci0303_6,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532690xci0303_6,NA,NA,NA

We tested its effectiveness using a cross-over design in 53 low socioeconomic status kindergarteners in France. Children showed improvements in tasks traditionally used to assess number sense (numerical comparison of digits and words). However, there was no improvement on non-symbolic measures of number sense, suggesting that rather than being in number sense per se, the improvement was in number sense access  or links between symbolic and non-symbolic representations of number. Focused adaptive interventions such as this may contribute to reducing the socioeconomic gap in math achievement.",3,4,224 –234,http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-228X.2009.01075.x,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-228X.2009.01075.x,NA,NA,NA
