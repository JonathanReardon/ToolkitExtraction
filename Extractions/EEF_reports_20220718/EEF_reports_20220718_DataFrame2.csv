There is no targeted syllabus content or outline of the activities to be followed. However, the CU approves and validates activities that have structured learning aims and are conducted in out-of-school hours.""\n""The programme intends to motivate pupils’ informal learning and participation in learning beyond school through reward-based strategies. An important feature of the CU intervention is each pupil’s ‘Passport to Learning’, used to record each activity and hours spent on the activities. The hours spent on approved learning activities are rewarded by the collection of credits that ultimately lead to the achievement of certificates. Children make their own choice of activities and receive a stamp in their CU Passport to Learning upon completion. They must attend for a specified time in order to gain CU credits and work towards CU Certificates of Achievement (from Bronze Undergraduate Award level (30 hours) to Gold Fellowship level (1,000 hours) and various grades in between). Each participating pupil must complete 30 hours of learning activities in order to achieve CU certification and participate in a graduation ceremony. There is a wide range of CU-validated activities in the form of after-school clubs such as arts and crafts, sports activities, book reading and maths, gardening, cookery, and youth clubs. There are also validated learning activities in approved ‘Learning Destinations’. These are various sites and organisations where pupils have opportunities to learn and receive information through experience, observations, attending talks and public lectures, and science festivals (see Appendix E). Schools often arrange these visits to complement the curriculum and class lessons. The common Learning Destinations validated by CU are museums, wildlife centres, historic places and monuments, theatres, and libraries. Pupils’ completion of learning activities during visits to Learning Destinations are awarded with credits in their Passports to Learning. CU has now included a set of social action modules where the idea is to promote volunteering, charitable work, and networking within and across the communities. In 30 hours of learning, pupils are expected to devote 15 hours to social action activities where the focus is volunteering, participation in active citizenship or community service. The social action activities are aligned with the aims of CU where the purpose is raising pupils’ aspiration, self-esteem and confidence, resilience, and social skills[¬e]""', 'Page 8:\n[¬s]""development. The CU centres provide support and ideas to schools in planning social action activities. Pupils’ participation is monitored, guided, and credited in the Passports to Learning by teachers and CU staff members. There are several social action activities and projects validated by CU. Validation criteria include conditions such as that the activity should have structured learning aims and the activity takes place under supervision of at least one staff member and must be in out-of-school hours. The range includes activities at the school level, local area level, regional, and national level.""\n""Charity and fundraising activities CU has validated various charity and fundraising activities. A general idea is to introduce the concept of charity through school assemblies and raise pupils’ awareness about different social causes, involving pupils in ideas for fundraising activities. The schools take up these activities as small projects. This involves organising events for pupils’ participation in walks for awareness, selling products made by pupils in school, participating in art and craft works for raising funds (see Appendix E for photos), or making food packs for homeless people. Community work Community work involves social actions that target problems in the community such as litter, graffiti, vandalism, and bullying. The CU local managers provide support and information to schools in organising regular events where pupils get the opportunity to discuss problems in their local communities and engage in social actions. Sometimes local partnerships are also involved to facilitate events, awareness talks, campaigns, litter picking activities, and information and awareness on recycling and disposal. Schools are encouraged to organise activities as national events in order to maximise the awareness. This involves pupils’ engagement with the local community during the time of festivals and events such as World Environment Day, Black History Month and so on. Volunteering CU validates several volunteering activities and schemes that allow pupils to volunteer in social action, personal development skills, and life skills. Participation in schemes such as the Duke of Edinburgh Award, Brownies, Beavers, and Cubs are acknowledged by CU as volunteering activities and pupil participation in such activities is given reward credits. Participation in learning skills that can support a social action are also given credits. Schools offer training courses in first-aid and fire-safety courses (see Appendix E). Other volunteering opportunities for pupils include being part of a team running a summer project, or supporting school staff or a local library in out-of-school hours.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Children’s University (CU) aims to improve the aspirations, attainment, and skills of pupils aged 5–14 by providing learning activities beyond the normal school day.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Charity or voluntary organisation'],NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 8:\n[¬s]""In this trial the CU introductory training was given to the treatment schools in all four regions in which the trial was being conducted.

Figures are estimates provided by the developers, and costs are estimated over three years for comparability across EEF projects. If a school were to deliver this intervention over three years, the cost increases in the Graduation events because these events would have the maximum number of children completing successfully in the third year of the project. In the 1st and 2nd years, schools/children were not all ready to receive the CU certificates.

If CU costs £3,287 in total over three years, and assuming 25 volunteering eligible pupils per school across two year groups, the average cost per pupil per year is around £45 (including the £6 CU membership fee, as above).

The core concept is that pupils are slowly introduced to musical skills, firstly through listening, singing or movement, and it is only once they are familiar with such concepts that they learn musical notation. Activities to reinforce the concepts include things such as games, movement, songs and exercises. The singing curriculum was split into two-week workshops (six workshops per term). For each workshop, a learning objective and an assessment criteria were given in the curriculum. For example, during workshop[¬e]""', 'Page 14:\n[¬s]""one, the learning objective was to \x91show and feel the beat\x92, and the assessment criterion was to \x91experience and learn about the pulse in music and to speak rhythmically and show the beat in various ways\x92.

The minimum core cost for a school to train and equip five coaches to deliver the intervention to 60 pupils for a year would be around £76,300 (around £15,260 per coach, or £1,272 per pupil). The maximum cost (core plus variable costs) would be around £87,100 (around £17,420 per coach, or £1,452 per pupil). Core costs\x97salaries The schools in the trial each had core staffing costs for the annual salaries for each coach employed (16 coaches in total in this trial, spread across the four schools). Coaches were employed full time for 35 hours a week over an academic year; their salaries were £16,200 per coach in the trial year (£13,500 plus on-costs at 20%). For the following year of coaching, the lead school has reported being able to recruit coaches at a lower salary of £14,000 (£12,000 plus on-costs at 20%). There were additional staffing costs associated with administration (in the lead school this amounted to one day per fortnight of administrative personnel support time). Assuming some administration is required (irrespective of whether the project is a trial, or a single-school project), staffing costs at one day per fortnight to support five coaches for a year would be approximately £1,900 (around £380 per coach).[¬e]""', 'Page 26:\n[¬s]""Core costs\x97training and resources There were also costs for training materials and training time, including the literacy conference which took place in February 2014. Training costs were of the order of £3,000 for five coaches in the lead school where they spent around 90 minutes weekly training each coach, and staff attended the literacy coaching conference at a cost of around £600 per coach. The lead school has reported that training costs can be reduced by a third in the second year (to around £2,000 for five coaches in one school\x97 around £400 per coach); we have used this lower figure to estimate core costs rather than the start-up figure for the trial year. Core costs for resources (books, printing, stationery, rewards, and applications) are estimated at around £400 for a year for a school with five coaches (around £80 per coach). Variable costs In practice, both training and resourcing costs were variable costs. The lead school, for example, spent £1,200 on resources in the trial year (around £240 per coach), as a laptop was purchased for the coaches. Similarly, training costs in the first year of a programme in a school would entail greater material costs than in subsequent years. There are clearly economies of scale in training and equipping coaches: if joint training was provided for coaches from a number of schools, savings would be made. Trial school costs Run as a trial, there were also costs for a member of staff to oversee the intervention (£3,104, or £16.78 per pupil), and for senior leadership time of around one day each fortnight to coordinate the project (£5400, or £29.19 per pupil). These costs facilitated the whole trial, involving 4 schools, 12 coaches and 185 intervention pupils. These costs are not included in the intervention costs per school and per pupil shown at the top of Section 3.5. In trial schools, coaches were provided with worksheets, stationery and reading books and, in some schools, computer equipment (a laptop in one school, and tablets in another). Some coaches had small personal expenses: some, for example, did their colour printing at home because they found it difficult to access the facilities at school; some bought small rewards; some downloaded educational applications; and some bought one or two books to use with their pupils.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Is this an EEF evaluation?', 'An organization commissioned independently to evaluate']",NA,NA,,Yes,,['Yes'],"['Page 20:\n[¬s]""Chi-squared tests on all background factors presented in this section revealed no significant differences between groups for the data after attrition.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Yes'],"['Page 23:\n[¬s]""The primary outcome analysis consisted of a regression model with backward selection.

It also explains the views of case-study schools on whether any additional costs were incurred or additional time required to participate in the interventions and any resultant implementation activity. Costs of participating: IEE materials and evidence fair Schools participating in these interventions were not charged any subscription fees for paid-for materials (some of the IEE materials are freely available to schools anyway). The evidence fair was free to participating schools. A case-study school reported that there were no additional costs, resources, or time-demands associated with engaging with the materials, as reading and discussing them was considered part of normal CPD activity (such as discussing ideas at staff meetings) and any resulting modifications to practice used existing resources. Supply cover costs could be incurred by schools to attend events, and were seen as additional or not, as applicable to each school’s supply cover practices. Costs of participating: Teaching How2s teaching and learning website and introductory event Schools participating in these interventions had free access to the Teaching How2s website during the first and second years of the evaluation (spring and summer terms of 2015, and academic year 2015/2016). The introductory event was also free to schools. Subsequent to this evaluation, schools faced the normal subscription charges to continue to use the website if they wished, but with a discounted rate of ‘buy two years, get three’ as described in the notes above. Case-study schools expressed concern about meeting this cost and suggested that it may prohibit their longer-term use of the resource. Both case-study schools were exploring the possibility of offsetting the cost of subscription by becoming How2s ‘hub’ schools and supporting neighbouring schools to use the resource. Participating schools identified the cost of travel to the introductory event as additional to normal expenditure. The schools did not have to purchase any additional resources to use How2s. Engaging with this intervention required teachers to spend time attending the induction, cascading information to colleagues, planning how to implement ideas, and conducting peer-observations. However, this was generally regarded as being commensurate with normal teaching and teacher- development activities, and though it may have displaced time spent on other development activities with a different focus, overall, it required little additional time investment. Using the How2s website as part of the trial was considered by case-study interviewees as a relatively low-cost intervention, particularly given it is school-based (but note, the subscription fee was waived for the trial). Costs of participating: CEM materials, training and INCAS diagnostic tool Schools participating in these interventions received the printed booklet and posters free in the post (so did not incur printing costs) during the first year of the evaluation (spring and summer terms 2015). The training events and access to INCAS were also free to schools during the first year of the evaluation (2015/2016). The case-study schools reported either no, or very minimal, travel costs to attend the training events as these were either hosted by the school or were very local. Schools did not have to purchase any additional resources as part of the intervention as existing resources could be used (such as a computer with internet access, software such as PowerPoint, printing and laminating, and workbooks). Engaging with this intervention required teachers to spend time attending training, cascading information to colleagues, discussing and reviewing approaches at staff meetings, planning how to implement ideas, and creating and collating teaching and learning resources. Interviewees views varied as to whether this time was considered as additional—the twilight CPD sessions were considered as additional time by one teacher—though generally these activities were considered to be a reasonable investment of time and part of normal practice for teachers.[¬e]""', 'Page 49:\n[¬s]"" Education Endowment Foundation 47 Costs of participating: ResearchEd and NatCen conference and webinars Schools participating in these interventions paid a nominal charge of £15 to attend a conference during the first year of the evaluation (2015/2016) which was reimbursed upon attendance. The pre- and post-conference online webinars were free for participating schools to access. The case-study schools incurred small additional costs for travel to attend a conference. Schools did not have to purchase any additional resources to engage with the intervention itself as these already existed in the school (for example, a computer with internet access). However, case-study schools did incur additional costs associated with implementing some of the practices introduced at the conference (such as purchasing books suitable for reciprocal reading, buying an additional external training day on Fischer Family Trust reciprocal reading, or buying a one-to-one phonics tutoring kit, workbooks, or phonics-based games). Engaging with the Literacy Octopus intervention itself required a day of additional time to attend the conference (this was on a Saturday so was outside of normal working hours, though some schools gave teachers a working-day off in lieu) and online webinars. Teachers also reported that implementing new teaching strategies identified at the conference also involved their time to: cascade information to colleagues; attend additional training on the approach; plan how to implement the approach and trial in class; create and collate resources; and coach colleagues on using the new approach. Most of these tasks were considered to be part of normal teaching activity, and although this may have displaced a focus on a different approach, this did not represent substantial additional time burden.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Is this an EEF evaluation?', 'An organization commissioned independently to evaluate']",NA,NA,,Yes,,['Yes'],"['Page 19:\n[¬s]""Imbalance at baseline As the primary outcome was available from administrative data, it was anticipated that the level of missing data would not exceed 5% at either the school or pupil level.

This was free to schools but would have cost each school £200 to attend if it had not been covered by general project funding. Each school would have had to fund supply cover for 2 members of teaching staff who attended (one day in each case) – a further £380 per school. The schools did not have to buy any additional resources but they did have to support the project work by additional time in school for the colleagues involved to consider the test and lesson observation evidence, to co-plan and collaborate on classroom application of resources and findings and time to respond to data requests and other communications from the project management team. The amount of time each school allocated to this varied. The more successful schools put a lot of time into the activities and provided ample opportunity for staff to experiment and reflect. A rough estimate would be a minimum of 5 days per school additional internal time. To calculate the cost of this it might be helpful to use the LA day rate for teacher supply costs of £190 per day – so 5 x £190 = £950 per school. If we add together all these estimated costs, the notional cost per school is £3,630 per treatment school and £580 per control school.

This would bring it down to £15 per child for the ICT and £14.91 for the non-ICT intervention. Addendum 1: In this trial, schools were paid for TAs to be able to attend training (they were paid £128 each). A total of £128 x 49 TAs = £6272. For 710 children, adds £8.83 per child. Their travel costs were also paid, at an estimate to be £25 per TA: £25 x 49 TAs = £1225. This adds £1.73 per child. Thus, the total cost for expenses to cover training are equal to £8.83 + £1.73 = £10.56 per child.

NOTE: Following the EEF guidance, the impact on staff time should be reported separately in units of time. Given that most schools did not appoint new TAs or extended hours of existing TAs, we have not included a salary cost for the TAs in the above estimate. In terms of time, TAs are calculated to have employed 4160 hours for 710 children. This amounts to 5.85 TA hours per child per year.

Projects should be planned in conjunction with the English department and at least one other discipline so that links can be made between traditional instruction and PBL. There is also a requirement for a member of the school leadership team to be a part of the team leading the work in the school. In addition, Learning through REAL Projects lessons should be timetabled to account for at least 20% of the Year 7 timetable (though 40% to 50% was recommended) and at least one project during the year should be an extended project accounting for a minimum of six full days learning time. Pupils should be taught in blocks lasting at least half a day. Teachers are required to plan projects from scratch or to adapt existing projects for their schools, with a recommended one to three hours of planning time per week for the team leading the work. This additional planning is required particularly as each project has to be planned from start to finish with deadlines for exhibition (for delivery of a number of lessons) and delivered in a similar way by different teachers\x97quite different to traditional lessons.

Further discussion of implementation can be found in the process evaluation section. There were also expectations specified of the types of projects to be taught and the essential elements of REAL Projects that needed to be evident in those projects. Schools were required to start by adapting an existing project set by the Innovation Unit\x97publishing an A to Z book as described above\x97with the content selected by the school.

The mean time for the whole intervention delivery was 20 hours during this evaluation.""\n""In the first lessons of the intervention, short phrases and sentences constitute the focus of the lesson, with an emphasis on phoneme blending. Longer passages are central to later lessons, especially in the Advanced Butterfly Reader. The excerpt forming the main topic of the lesson is read aloud by the teacher towards the beginning of the lesson so that the pupils appreciate the context, which is usually historical, and gain the gist of the passage. This aspect of Butterfly instruction sets it apart from many purely phonics schemes which may not spend as much time as Butterfly in overtly teaching an understanding of the global aspects of a text. A class discussion of the gist and meaning of the passage is encouraged by the teacher, who picks on individuals to ask for their contributions, in addition to pupils volunteering their own contributions. This direct questioning of pupils at random is intended to engage everyone and to check on the level of understanding of individuals. Misconceptions can be identified by the teacher and there is scope to discuss them and revisit them later in the lesson or in another lesson. Pupils are then asked to read a section of the text and their mistakes are corrected by the teacher, who reminds the class of the spelling, pronunciation, and grammatical rules they have encountered previously as well as introducing new ones. This allows the pupils to question the teacher about literacy rules that they are not clear about, or meanings that require clarification. A period of writing, using the new vocabulary learnt, is included. This may be dictation from the passage or answering questions on it or making up some sentences of their own. Homework may be given in connection with the subject of the lesson. An interesting feature of the Butterfly programme is the continuation of the phonics approaches of early reading into the essentially comprehension-based Advanced Butterfly Reader lessons. There is an emphasis on the new vocabulary encountered in each lesson which concentrates on the sound patterns in those new words, for example, ‘imminent’, ‘eminent’, ‘persistent’. This feature is thought by the project to be unique to the scheme. These words are introduced at the start of the lesson; some of them can be identified in the text but others are not and their meanings may not be consolidated but their common sound patterns are pointed out.""\n""Spelling is important to the programme and spelling progress is monitored. Pupils only move on to higher levels of tuition when their spelling and reading are up to levels where they can cope with the[¬e]""', 'Page 12:\n[¬s]""more demanding course.

The reading ages of the pupils are determined by an in-house test of single word reading. The exact entry lesson is tailored for a particular group of pupils because groupings and starting points will vary according to the needs of the pupils within a particular school. At the end of the Butterfly Book, a consolidation test checks that the pupils are sufficiently skilled to take on the demands of the Advanced Butterfly Reader. In the study, all the pupils except two remained in the class in which they started, and progressed through the books together; two pupils began in Butterfly Class 2 and found the work very easy so were moved up to Class 3.

It is also available from retail book websites. The Butterfly Grammar Book costs £9.50, has the same publisher, and is available from the same outlets. During the intervention, it was used only occasionally, when grammatical weaknesses were identified. The Advanced Butterfly Reader and Junior Butterfly Reader cost the project £10.00 each. They are printed by Printmeit but have not yet been published. It is possible to pre-order printed versions of them through Real Action. The Advanced Butterfly Reader was used in this trial because it was most suited to the age group being studied. Each pupil was provided with an exercise book and a pencil by the Real Action project. The project therefore cost nothing for the schools to be involved in, apart from staff liaison time with the project, providing lists, and setting up the computer tests. Schools varied greatly in how much teacher time they were prepared to give the project in a supporting role, helping with discipline problems if necessary, and ensuring pupils’ attendance at intervention lessons and test administration sessions. Training The Butterfly practitioners who taught the intervention were postgraduate students recruited from London University colleges, as described earlier, as well as local people with experience of working with pupils, some of whom were qualified teachers. Initial training was delivered by the Education Director of Real Action and the Project Manager for Butterfly Phonics. The practitioners were then required to observe classes at the Butterfly Saturday Reading School which is the project’s model school and works as their training centre. Once complete, they received specialist training by Irina Tyk, the author of the Butterfly Book. When they started teaching the intervention, the practitioners were observed regularly by the Education Director and the Project Manager and given feedback during monthly teacher meetings. These teacher meetings also functioned as mini training sessions and were an opportunity for teachers to share experiences. Butterfly practitioners were paid £20 per hour. All Butterfly classes are delivered to pupils by two adults: either one teacher (at £20.00 per hour) with one teaching assistant (at £15.00 per hour) or two teachers (each at £20.00 per hour). Therefore the cost of the Butterfly teaching staff for a one-hour class was £35 or £40. The specialist training from Irina Tyk cost £600 for half a day. Assuming eight pupils in a class, the following costs have been estimated (fewer or more pupils in a class will alter these figures). The cost per pupil is calculated as £21 for course books and stationery, and £87.50 for the teaching of 20 hours of the intervention (20 hours is the average number of hours that a pupil in Phases One and Two received the intervention). The £87.50 is based on the £35 an hour cost for the project of a Butterfly practitioner and a Butterfly teaching assistant. The overall estimated cost per child in these circumstances is therefore £108.50, based on information provided by the project.[¬e]""', 'Page 26:\n[¬s]""If an experienced teacher employed by a school were to teach alongside a teaching assistant, the teaching cost would be higher by about £10 an hour per lesson, increasing this estimated teacher cost to approximately £112.50 for a 20-hour course of instruction, and the overall cost rises to £133.50 per child. The Butterfly practitioners undergo extensive training, which includes periods of observing experienced practitioners as well as specialist training. It is possible that experienced teachers may not require such intensive training but they would need some training in the Butterfly method. It is not known what form such training would take once it was rolled out nationally, but training courses and instructional videos are likely to be involved. An amount to cover these contingencies would have to be factored in to the costs for a school. In conclusion, if pupils were to be taught in groups of eight by fully trained Butterfly practitioners, the estimated cost is £108.50 per pupil; if taught by experienced school teachers with teaching assistants, the estimated cost is £133.50, not including specialist training in the Butterfly method.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['An organization commissioned independently to evaluate', 'Is this an EEF evaluation?']",NA,NA,,Yes,,['Yes'],"['Page 19:\n[¬s]"" EAL is disproportionate between the intervention and control groups with 65% (28) of pupils with a different language as their first language in the control group.""\n""Other factors except SEN are also comparable between the experimental groups.[¬e]""']",NA,,['Unclear or details not provided'],NA,NA,,['Yes'],"['Page 19:\n[¬s]""Table 6: Baseline characteristics of the pupils in the study""\n""Table 7: Baseline characteristics of the pupils in the study[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Educational attainment', 'Gender', 'Socio-economic status', 'Special educational needs', 'Other (please specify)']","['Page 19:\n[¬s]""NGRT""\n""SWRT""\n""PhAB[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""Gender[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""FSM[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""SEN[¬e]""', 'Page 19:\n[¬s]""EAL""\n""Pupil Premium""\n""Ethnicity[¬e]""']","Pupil Premium, EAL, Ethnicity",,['Yes'],"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""The data were analysed using multilevel modelling to account for the clustering of pupils within schools.[¬e]""']",NA,

The ReflectED approach comprises the following: 1. Pupils receive a weekly ReflectED lesson from their teacher who follows a series of lesson plans. 2. At least once a week, pupils are expected to reflect individually on their learning in other lessons and record these reflections on the Evernote platform (accessible through any tablet, netbook, laptop or PC). The lesson plans include tasks for the week, to support pupils to practice their metacognitive skills throughout their normal lessons. 3. Children code their reflections to record their thoughts on a lesson and their performance. This enables them, and the teacher, to read previous reflections to inform future teaching and learning.""\n""There are a total of 28 lessons in the materials provided by Rosendale. These lessons teach children specific metacognitive strategies they can use to support their learning, and teach them to reflect on their learning. For example, in the first lesson children are encouraged to think about when they learned something new and are then taught to juggle or do origami, which is not a skill they have learned before. Throughout this lesson pupils are encouraged to talk about how instruction helps them to learn, about learning in stages and the importance of practice.""\n""Enabling children to reflect well takes time and is scaffolded using a number of tools. A colour-coded system is used for the children to quickly show how well they thought they had done in a particular task. Green, for example, is used by a child to show they have been successful at the task and blue if they believe they have mastered the topic. Yellow denotes they are struggling and red is used to show that they are \x91stuck\x92. A set of pictures showing different feelings, like happy faces or rain clouds, is also provided along with a range of emotion words for the children to express their feelings about the learning process. The colour code, pictures and words are displayed in the classroom for children to quickly refer to. In the early stages of the process children fill in paper-based templates, which are pasted into their workbooks. When children start using the Evernote software on the iPads to record their reflections, they can either take pictures of the paper-based templates, or take pictures of the images or words expressing emotion and add a typed comment. These comments can become very detailed. They can also add audio or video to record reflections.

To calculate the cost of headteachers’ time, we tak e the 20 th percentile of the headteacher pay scale in England and Wales (£56,027): 9 this is then divided by 230 (the approximate number of working days in a year) to give a headteacher day rate of £243. 10 We then inflate this figure by a fifth to allow for other costs not directly incorporated into headteachers’ salaries ( such as employer contributions to pensions) giving a total cost of £292. 11 Analogous calculations were made for the head of maths (two days training at a final day rate of £196) 12 and the class teachers (a total of four days training at a final day rate of £141). 13 Total training costs therefore amount to £1,248.

The ‘per pupil’ cost of delivering the primary school intervention was therefore £127 for the first year.
