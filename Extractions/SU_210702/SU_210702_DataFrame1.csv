50757352,Blanding-Stewart (2015),2015,"Whether to have or not to have a dress code within a state, school district, or individual school has been the source of continuing debate. Opponents of adopting school dress codes or school uniforms often focus on the legal issues and effectiveness surrounding such policies. This study examined the effectiveness of a re-implemented student dress code policy using a sequential explanatory, mixed methods design. The focus of the quantitative portion of the study was to determine whether there was a significant difference in the 2011 and 2013 results of the Keystone Algebra Examinations for high school students pre- and post-dress code reinstitution at one high school. The qualitative portion of the study gave voice to selected students, parents, teachers, and administrators by assessing their perceptions of the dress code policy's effectiveness on school safety, discipline, and the learning environment. A statistically significant difference was found between the mean scores on the Keystone Algebra Examination in 2011 (pre-dress code re-implementation) and 2013 (post-dress code re-implementation). The increase in the 2013 scores can be partially attributed to the 2012-2013 reinstituted dress code policy. Five other variables-LEP/not gifted, Title I, English Language Learners, Title III, and Economically Disadvantaged-were found to be other potential contributing factors in the 2013 scores. The overall qualitative findings indicated that, through the perceptions of the 12 interviewed stakeholders, that the reinstituted dress code policy had a positive influence on school safety, discipline, and the learning environment at the high school.

50757370,Draa (2005),2005,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not the implementation of a mandatory uniform policy in urban public high schools improved school performance measures at the building level for rates of attendance, graduation, academic proficiency, and student conduct as measured by rates of suspensions and expulsions. Sixty-four secondary schools serving students in grades 9-12 in Ohio's eight largest cities were included in this study. Four comparisons were used to ascertain if the school uniform policy influenced improvements in school performance measures, employing a time-series quantitative design. These four methods were used to control for other plausible explanations for improvements by grouping schools locally and statewide, and by matching similar schools based on enrollment demographics and administrators' survey responses. Analyses employed ANOVA and t-tests with Cohen's d for small sample size. Through these four comparisons, a pattern emerged that indicated improvement in rates of attendance, graduation, and suspension, but not in academic proficiency or expulsion rates in these schools with uniform policies. It was also determined that schools with uniform policies had higher proportions of economically disadvantaged and minority students than the larger population of urban public high schools. Implementation of a uniform policy in these schools may be effective for improving rates of attendance, graduation, and suspensions. These results may be important considerations for urban public schools seeking alternative means to improve their performance outcomes.

Although at three points in time there were more disciplinary referrals reported for the after the uniform dress code sample than the before the uniform dress code sample, after adjusting the outcome measures on the basis of the two covariates, only the 9 th grade group differences were statistically significant. At 10 th grade, with or without the covariates, the after the uniform dress code sample outperformed the before the uniform dress code on reading achievement and the difference was statistically significant. There were no statistically significant group differences on the basis of the adjusted mathematics achievement data.
