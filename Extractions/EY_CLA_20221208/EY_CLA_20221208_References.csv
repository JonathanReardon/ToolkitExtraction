Vocabulary training involved practice in recognizing and applying words from the PPVT and the PI. Sentence training consisted of imitating sentences similar to those in the SIT and constructing new instances of the same sentence types. Analyses of variance showed that vocabulary training had a positive effect on recognition and production of the words taught (p < .025), but did not transfer to sentence imitation.

Program implementation should be based on valid research pertaining to the efficacy of the approach being used. Concern for the learner's nature and needs should be an essential criterion to be applied in selecting particular instructional materials and procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two methods of introducing reading skills to kindergarteners. A total of 87 subjects participated in the investigation. One group of 42 subjects was designated as the control group, and one group of 45 subjects was designated as the experimental group. Both groups were administered the Developmental Indicator for the Assessment of Learning-R to determine if there was a significant difference between the two groups at the.05 level when the investigation commenced. Statistical analysis using the t-test for independent means yielded no significant difference between the groups. The control and experimental groups received reading readiness instruction via two different approaches. The control group received reading instruction via a basal reader readiness program (Houghton Mifflin), and the experimental group received reading instruction via an eclectic, integrated, approach (Success). The instructional period lasted for a period of 140 days. The performance of the two groups on the California Achievement Test, Form E, was analyzed using a t-test for independent means and an a priori alpha risk of.05 to test the six null hypotheses. There were significant differences on the following subtests performance favoring the experimental (Success) group  Reading Comprehension, Reading Vocabulary, Reading Total, and Language Expression. There were no significant differences between the performance of the two groups on the subtests of Sound Recognition and Visual Recognition. The results of the investigation reveal that the Success approach, which is an integrated, eclectic approach, is an effective method for teaching beginning reading skills to kindergarteners.

Because there is a strong relationship between language development during the early years and reading ability in the primary grades, early childhood teachers must understand language and literacy development. Children enter kindergarten in the United States with large differences in their background knowledge, vocabulary, and early literacy experiences. It is essential that early childhood programs provide quality language experiences such as read-alouds in order for children to become successful readers. This study examined the strategy of using nonfiction interactive book read-alouds with the emergent reader in preschool to promote vocabulary development. In this quantitative study, 53 three-, four-, and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program were participants. The preschool children were assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT) as pre and posttests. The researcher read nonfiction literature to one class and fictional text to another twice per week for 12 weeks but did not read to the control group. Standardized test scores did not show significant differences in the post-test scores among the control and the two treatment groups, although all groups showed improvement in their receptive and expressive vocabularies. In addition, a survey designed by the researcher was sent out to preschool teachers and childcare providers about the amount of time they read aloud to children, the amount of time they spend reading fiction compared to nonfiction text, and their years of teaching in early childhood and educational backgrounds. Results showed that teachers in early childhood programs are reading to children an average of 8.5 out of 10 days, although nonfiction literature is not being read to young children as much as fiction. The findings in this report have implications for practice in the field. Because vocabulary development is a key ingredient in the learning-to-read process, teachers and parents can use nonfiction as a tool, if they are aware of the benefits of how to use this genre to support children's emerging literacy skills.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://search.proquest.com/docview/85628208,NA,Vermillion,University of South Dakota

Methods  Following screening of 960 children, 152 children (mean age 4 09) were selected from 19 schools on the basis of poor vocabulary and verbal reasoning skills and randomly allocated to either the P + R programme or the OL programme. Both groups of children received 20 weeks of daily intervention alternating between small group and individual sessions, delivered by trained teaching assistants. Children in the P + R group received training in letter-sound knowledge, phonological awareness and book level reading skills. Children in the OL group received instruction in vocabulary, comprehension, inference generation and narrative skills. The children's progress was monitored at four time points  pre-, mid- and post-intervention, and after a 5-month delay, using measures of literacy, language and phonological awareness. Results  The data are clustered (children within schools) and robust confidence intervals are reported. At the end of the 20-week intervention programme, children in the P + R group showed an advantage over the OL group on literacy and phonological measures, while children in the OL group showed an advantage over the P + R group on measures of vocabulary and grammatical skills. These gains were maintained over a 5-month period. Conclusions  Intervention programmes designed to develop oral language skills can be delivered successfully by trained teaching assistants to children at school entry. Training using P + R fostered decoding ability whereas the OL programme improved vocabulary and grammatical skills that are foundations for reading comprehension. However, at the end of the intervention, more than 50% of at-risk children remain in need of literacy support.",49,4,422-432,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01849.x,https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01849.x,NA,NA,NA

Participants included 122 kindergarteners from three elementary schools within three separate school districts in the northeastern United States who were assigned to either a treatment condition (ELLS, n = 31 EOLs, n = 49) or no-treatment condition (ELLs, n = 17 EOLs, n = 25). Interventionists were trained to deliver direct vocabulary instruction using one of 18 storybooks twice per week in 20-25 minute sessions. The research design of the study employed a pretest, posttest, quasi- experimental group design. Analyses consisted of two-by-two analyses of variance (2 x 2 ANOVAs), with two between-subjects factors (instructional condition x language status), and t-tests to examine the effects of vocabulary intervention on the word learning of ELLs and EOLs, and hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) to investigate word learning differences between ELLs and EOLs using pretest PPVT-III to predict posttest target-word and general, receptive vocabulary knowledge. Participants' knowledge of vocabulary was individually assessed with a researcher-developed measure of target-word knowledge (TWKM) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III (PPVT-III Dunn & Dunn, 1997). Results for 2 x 2 ANOVAs and t-tests indicated that EOLs significantly outperformed ELLs on dependent measures with evidence on an interaction effect on TWKM.

The 20-week intervention consists of two 15-minute individual sessions and three 30-minute small group sessions each week. The children selected to participate in this trial were the five children in each classroom who obtained the lowest scores on a school-administered app-based assessment of oral language skills (LanguageScreen).The programme focuses on developing children’s narrative, vocabulary, and listening skills, while phonological awareness and letter sound knowledge are also developed during the second half of the programme. Training includes an initial two-day course for TAs followed by a half-day workshop half-way through the programme in addition to ongoing online support. Teachers also receive an initial half-day of training so that they can understand the programme and support TAs. This project was a randomised controlled trial  193 schools participated, 97 of which received the programme while 96 did not, the latter forming the control group. The process evaluation involved observations of the training, surveys with school staff, case studies in six schools (which used interviews with school staff), and analyses of TA training logs and online resource use.

Recent federal government mandates, such as Early Reading First (2002) and Reading First (Armbruster, Lehr, & Osborn, 2001) have emphasized the importance of preschool and kindergarten in accelerating future achievement. Nearly all recommendations for improving the quality of preschool and kindergarten experience include reading aloud to children. Indeed, included in the joint statement of the International Reading Association and the National Association for the Education of Young Children is the assertion that ""the single most important activity for building understandings and skills essential for reading success appears to be reading aloud to children"" (1998). This study examined the effect of teachers' read-aloud styles on the listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition of kindergarten students. Combining methods based upon research by Martinez and Teale (1993), Wasik, Bond, and Hindman (2006), Coyne et al. (2004), Lonigan and Whitehurst (1998), Reese & Cox, (1999), and Brabham & Lynch-Brown (2002), two read-aloud styles were formulated. The full model included brief story introductions, teacher comments modeling the process of making inferences during reading, ""rich"" explanations of target vocabulary, open-ended questions focusing upon story events, an after reading summary question, and guided reconstruction. The parsimonious model emphasized vocabulary and questioning with each story combined with a retelling but without the introduction, after reading question, and story reconstruction. A third model, consisting of a teacher reading aloud in his or her traditional style with follow-up activities, served as the control for this research. Three kindergarten classrooms in each of four local elementary schools were recruited to implement each of the read-aloud models (N = 37). Quantitative data analyses indicated significantly higher gains in measures of vocabulary and comprehension, as well as longer and more complete story retellings, for students in classrooms whose teachers employed the full model of reading aloud, as opposed to students in the parsimonious model or control classrooms.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304680245,NA,Tuscaloosa,University of Alabama

Results  Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness.

Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure  however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies.

Although vocabulary development consistently emerges as a critical literacy skill for young children, many youngsters lag behind in word knowledge because of little exposure to a variety of children's books during their preschool years. Eighty preschool children from suburban preschools, inner-city preschools, and home schools were randomly assigned to a treatment or comparison group where they received either audiobooks or art supplies over 10 weeks. All children involved in the study were given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Forms A and B) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test in order to measure receptive and expressive vocabulary development. A pretest-posttest design was implemented in order to examine the effects on word knowledge when young children listen independently to audiobooks. Data analysis indicated that the children assigned to the experimental group saw a significant increase their receptive and expressive word knowledge. The children who scored the lowest during the initial pretesting experienced the largest gains after treatment was instituted. Although the frequency with which the treatment group listened to the audiobooks was related to the amount of increase in receptive vocabulary, there was no such correlation for expressive vocabulary development. Other demographic variables were also analyzed with varying results. Parents of the treatment group children overwhelmingly reported their children enjoyed listening to the audiobooks. Based on these results, the following two major conclusions can be drawn  (a) independent listening of children's books on audiotape can significantly increase a preschool child's receptive and expressive vocabulary, and (b) the lower the child's initial vocabulary scores, the greater the gain after treatment has been initiated.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305458415,NA,"Minneapolis, MN",Walden University

In this study, the following questions were investigated  (I) Would instruction in aural cloze improve the children's vocabulary? (II) Would instruction in aural cloze improve the children's listening comprehension? The subjects for this investigation were 39 boys and 38 girls comprising the kindergarten population of the Hillsdale School in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The kindergarten students were assigned by the two kindergarten teachers to two a.m. and two p.m. sessions. One intact a.m. session taught by one teacher and one intact p.m. session taught by the other teacher were selected as the experimental group. The experimental group consisted of 40 subjects, 20 boys and 20 girls. The other intact a.m. session taught by one teacher and the other p.m. session taught by the other teacher became the control group. The control group consisted of 37 subjects, 19 boys and 18 girls. As part of the on-going kindergarten curriculum, the teachers selected and read storybooks to the children. These storybooks were used in the construction of the aural cloze materials. Meaning-bearing words were systematically deleted from these storybooks. During the aural cloze instruction, the teachers read the specially prepared storybooks and stopped reading and looked at the children to signal that a word had been deleted. The children then supplied words which could complete the passage and still ""make sense."" Each word supplied by the children was discussed and its relationship to the context explored. The children in the experimental group received the aural cloze instruction four days a week for ten weeks.

However, community use of printed materials varies, resulting in a large number of nonmainstream children deemed at risk for school failure at an early age. In an effort to address this situation, a study examined the effects of including shared book reading activities in an urban preschool program that identified at-risk children through assessment of child and family characteristics. A year-long intervention supplemented the regular program with weekly classroom reading and sharing of simple books  use of book topics for writing and dramatic play  and shared book reading by parents and children at home. The study employed a quasi-experimental control design with multiple converging measures of children's knowledge of language and literacy constructs and parent questionnaire responses. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed that literacy development can be fostered through the incorporation of shared book reading. Pre- and posttest comparisons also revealed that at-risk children can make substantial growth in language development, print concept awareness, letter knowledge, writing, and reading abilities.

Early intervention in critical areas of preschool language (vocabulary, comprehension, and narrative ability) and early literacy skills can facilitate this development. Typical interventions in preschool settings utilize storybooks to target these critical areas. However, research on large group teacher implemented storybook interventions to improve language skills is limited. In this study, Head Start teachers were trained to use a storybook intervention entitled, Storybook Activities for Improving Language (SAIL). The SAIL intervention consisted of four days of teacher led activities built around storybooks incorporating repeated readings, vocabulary activities, and retelling and acting out activities. A main focus was on vocabulary skills with secondary focuses on comprehension, narrative ability, and print awareness. Language and early literacy measures were administered at pre and post test to the SAIL intervention group and a control group. A multivariate analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effectiveness o f SAIL on those measures. A significant effect was found for a vocabulary measure requiring children to name the categories and features o f the target vocabulary words used in the SAIL intervention and for a narrative retell measure requiring children to retell a story within a time limit. There were no significant effects found for vocabulary measures assessing general vocabulary development, comprehension, or print awareness. Based on the results, five conclusions can be drawn  a) the SAIL intervention led to increases in vocabulary skills  b) the SAIL intervention did not lead to increases in comprehension skills  c) the SAIL intervention led to increases in narrative ability  d) SAIL did not lead to increases in print awareness  and e) teachers rated the SAIL intervention favorably upon a program evaluation questionnaire. Despite limitations warranting caution in interpretation, this study added to existing research on storybook interventions in preschool in several ways. First, SAIL showed that a class-wide teacher implemented storybook intervention led to significant gains in vocabulary skills and narrative ability for preschool age children. Second, the four-day activity structure of SAIL was perceived as a beneficial learning experience by teachers.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305303109,NA,NA,University of Oregon

The study focuses on the degree to which teachers were able to implement such a program, the observable factors which characterized implementing classrooms, and the effects of implementation on the reading-related achievement of kindergarten children. The study was carried out in conjunction with a Right-to-Read grant from the U.S. Office of Education. Subjects for the effects-of-implementation analysis were 124 kindergarten students from four implementing and two nonimplementing classrooms. The results indicate that young children, even those from homes where exposure to a literate environment is not likely to occur, can develop important pre-literacy skills when the right environment is provided in the classroom. The results further indicate that children learn best in a language- and print-rich environment, characterized by many opportunities to observe, try out, and practice literacy skills in genuine communicative situations.",21,2,132-149,https://doi.org/10.2307/747841,https://www.jstor.org/stable/747841,NA, Washington DC ,Catholic Univeristy

Because these children are known to be at risk for later reading comprehension difficulties, it is important to design and test interventions that foster both literal and inferential language skills. Using a randomized pretest-posttest control group design, we investigated whether an 8-week, one-on-one book-sharing intervention would improve both the literal and inferential language skills of Head Start preschoolers with language impairments. Method  Thirty children were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no intervention or to a treatment group that received twice-weekly 15-min sessions in which adults read books and asked both literal and inferential questions about the books using scripts that were embedded throughout the text. Treatment and control groups were compared using pre- and posttest scores on 2 measures of literal and 1 measure of inferential language skill. Results  Significant group differences, and medium to large effect sizes, were found between pre- and posttest scores for all 3 measures. Conclusions  These findings suggest that book sharing with embedded questions that target both literal and inferential language skills can result in gains on both types of language in this population. Future studies with larger number of children are needed to corroborate these findings.",15,1,85-95,https://doi.org/10.1044/1058-0360(2006/009),https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/1058-0360%282006/009%29,NA,NA,NA

Three-year-olds were assigned to one of three conditions  vocabulary eliciting questions, noneliciting questions, and no questions (control). General vocabulary comprehension and novel word knowledge were equivalent across the groups before the storybook reading intervention. Children were read 3 storybooks repeatedly across 4 reading sessions and were tested for production and comprehension of novel words in the final session. Children's novel word comprehension increased more in both question conditions than in the control condition, suggesting that type of question is not as important to word learning as children's active engagement in discussion about novel words in general. Novel word production was not strongly affected by any of the reading conditions. However, asking children noneliciting questions did appear to foster production of new words more than not asking questions at all.",33,4,273-278,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-005-0052-0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-005-0052-0,NA,NA,NA

In an effort to examine adult qualitative variations in shared storybook readings, two experiments were conducted to assess the effect of noneliciting questions during shared storybook reading on children's receptive and expressive novel vocabulary learning. The sociocultural perspective was the theoretical framework of this dissertation study and maintains that learning is due to socially meaningful activity of the child within the environment (e.g., Bruner, 1983  Vygotsky, 1978). In the first experiment, 45 children enrolled in monolingual Head Start classrooms were ranked by general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of three conditions  vocabulary noneliciting questions, vocabulary eliciting questions, and no questions (control). In the second experiment, the novel vocabulary learning of 54 children enrolled in a bilingual English-Spanish Head Start program was investigated. In the second experiment, participants were ranked by Spanish general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of four conditions  (1) Spanish vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (2) English vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (3) Spanish labels, and (4) English labels. Experiment 1 utilized the methodological framework employed in previous experimental work on storybook reading  pretest, intervention, and posttest with the addition of a delayed posttest in Experiment 1. Vocabulary noneliciting questions, eliciting questions, and no questions appear to be equally effective. There was no decay of the words learned as determined by delayed post-test. Experiment 2's methodological framework resembles that utilized by Justice (2002) conducted with a monolingual sample. Experiment 2 also utilized other methodological considerations from the existing literature to examine the effects of noneliciting questions on the novel vocabulary learning of bilingual preschoolers. Experiment 2 revealed that English labels are more effective than English noneliciting questions for receptive knowledge. Spanish noneliciting questions lead to greater expressive word learning than Spanish labels. This study has a number of major impacts, including comparison of Experiment 1's results to the extant literature which is instructive  and, while there is a preponderance of literature with monolingual populations, research with bilingual populations is limited, thus Experiment 2 helps to close that gap.",NA,NA,147,NA,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305140676,NA,Ann Arbor,Texas Woman's University

Teachers read books to children and reinforced vocabulary in the books by presenting objects that represented the words and providing opportunities to use the words. The teachers also were trained to ask open-ended questions and to engage children in conversations about the book and activities. This provided children with opportunities to use language and learn vocabulary in a meaningful context. Children who were in the interactive book reading intervention group scored significantly better than children in the comparison group on Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III and other measures of receptive and expressive language.
