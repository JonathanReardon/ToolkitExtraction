Each child was tested before and after a 6-week training period with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), a Sentence Imitation Test (SIT), and a Picture Interview (PI).

Sentence training consisted of imitating sentences similar to those in the SIT and constructing new instances of the same sentence types. Analyses of variance showed that vocabulary training had a positive effect on recognition and production of the words taught (p < .025), but did not transfer to sentence imitation.

Program implementation should be based on valid research pertaining to the efficacy of the approach being used. Concern for the learner's nature and needs should be an essential criterion to be applied in selecting particular instructional materials and procedures. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of two methods of introducing reading skills to kindergarteners. A total of 87 subjects participated in the investigation. One group of 42 subjects was designated as the control group, and one group of 45 subjects was designated as the experimental group. Both groups were administered the Developmental Indicator for the Assessment of Learning-R to determine if there was a significant difference between the two groups at the.05 level when the investigation commenced. Statistical analysis using the t-test for independent means yielded no significant difference between the groups. The control and experimental groups received reading readiness instruction via two different approaches. The control group received reading instruction via a basal reader readiness program (Houghton Mifflin), and the experimental group received reading instruction via an eclectic, integrated, approach (Success). The instructional period lasted for a period of 140 days. The performance of the two groups on the California Achievement Test, Form E, was analyzed using a t-test for independent means and an a priori alpha risk of.05 to test the six null hypotheses. There were significant differences on the following subtests performance favoring the experimental (Success) group  Reading Comprehension, Reading Vocabulary, Reading Total, and Language Expression. There were no significant differences between the performance of the two groups on the subtests of Sound Recognition and Visual Recognition.

38111475,Bortnem (2005),2005,"Young children acquire new vocabulary at an amazing rate during the first five years of life. Because there is a strong relationship between language development during the early years and reading ability in the primary grades, early childhood teachers must understand language and literacy development. Children enter kindergarten in the United States with large differences in their background knowledge, vocabulary, and early literacy experiences. It is essential that early childhood programs provide quality language experiences such as read-alouds in order for children to become successful readers. This study examined the strategy of using nonfiction interactive book read-alouds with the emergent reader in preschool to promote vocabulary development. In this quantitative study, 53 three-, four-, and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program were participants. The preschool children were assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test (EVT) as pre and posttests. The researcher read nonfiction literature to one class and fictional text to another twice per week for 12 weeks but did not read to the control group. Standardized test scores did not show significant differences in the post-test scores among the control and the two treatment groups, although all groups showed improvement in their receptive and expressive vocabularies. In addition, a survey designed by the researcher was sent out to preschool teachers and childcare providers about the amount of time they read aloud to children, the amount of time they spend reading fiction compared to nonfiction text, and their years of teaching in early childhood and educational backgrounds. Results showed that teachers in early childhood programs are reading to children an average of 8.5 out of 10 days, although nonfiction literature is not being read to young children as much as fiction. The findings in this report have implications for practice in the field. Because vocabulary development is a key ingredient in the learning-to-read process, teachers and parents can use nonfiction as a tool, if they are aware of the benefits of how to use this genre to support children's emerging literacy skills.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4', '5']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,2,"['Page 22:\n[¬s]""four classrooms[¬e]""', 'Page 45:\n[¬s]""The control group included 23 preschoolers from two classrooms that did not take part in read-alouds with the researcher.[¬e]""']",,2,"['Page 45:\n[¬s]""The control group included 23 preschoolers from two classrooms that did not take part in read-alouds with the researcher.[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 22:\n[¬s]""four classrooms[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 52:\n[¬s]""fiction treatment group""\n""nonfiction treatment group""\n""control group[¬e]""']",NA,,"Non-random, but matched",NA,NA,,School - multi-site,NA,NA,,['Prospective QED'],"['Page 45:\n[¬s]""A convenience sample o f 59 three-, fo u r- , and five-year old children enrolled in a Head Start program in a small Midwestern community o f approximately 25,000 took part in the study.

Methods  Following screening of 960 children, 152 children (mean age 4 09) were selected from 19 schools on the basis of poor vocabulary and verbal reasoning skills and randomly allocated to either the P + R programme or the OL programme. Both groups of children received 20 weeks of daily intervention alternating between small group and individual sessions, delivered by trained teaching assistants. Children in the P + R group received training in letter-sound knowledge, phonological awareness and book level reading skills. Children in the OL group received instruction in vocabulary, comprehension, inference generation and narrative skills. The children's progress was monitored at four time points  pre-, mid- and post-intervention, and after a 5-month delay, using measures of literacy, language and phonological awareness. Results  The data are clustered (children within schools) and robust confidence intervals are reported. At the end of the 20-week intervention programme, children in the P + R group showed an advantage over the OL group on literacy and phonological measures, while children in the OL group showed an advantage over the P + R group on measures of vocabulary and grammatical skills. These gains were maintained over a 5-month period. Conclusions  Intervention programmes designed to develop oral language skills can be delivered successfully by trained teaching assistants to children at school entry. Training using P + R fostered decoding ability whereas the OL programme improved vocabulary and grammatical skills that are foundations for reading comprehension.

Participants included 122 kindergarteners from three elementary schools within three separate school districts in the northeastern United States who were assigned to either a treatment condition (ELLS, n = 31 EOLs, n = 49) or no-treatment condition (ELLs, n = 17 EOLs, n = 25). Interventionists were trained to deliver direct vocabulary instruction using one of 18 storybooks twice per week in 20-25 minute sessions. The research design of the study employed a pretest, posttest, quasi- experimental group design. Analyses consisted of two-by-two analyses of variance (2 x 2 ANOVAs), with two between-subjects factors (instructional condition x language status), and t-tests to examine the effects of vocabulary intervention on the word learning of ELLs and EOLs, and hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) to investigate word learning differences between ELLs and EOLs using pretest PPVT-III to predict posttest target-word and general, receptive vocabulary knowledge. Participants' knowledge of vocabulary was individually assessed with a researcher-developed measure of target-word knowledge (TWKM) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III (PPVT-III Dunn & Dunn, 1997). Results for 2 x 2 ANOVAs and t-tests indicated that EOLs significantly outperformed ELLs on dependent measures with evidence on an interaction effect on TWKM. HMR results indicated (a) centered pretest PPVT-III accounted for a statistically significant proportion of the variance in posttest measures for participants in the treatment condition and (b) language status did not explain any additional variance in posttest measures above pretest PPVT-III. Each of the two mediation models using the independent variable, language status mediating variable, centered pretest PPVT-III and dependent measures TWKM and PPVT-III resulted in full mediation. Major findings indicated that treatment ELLs and treatment EOLs did equally well on posttest if they had similar initial general, receptive vocabulary knowledge on PPVT-III.

The 20-week intervention consists of two 15-minute individual sessions and three 30-minute small group sessions each week. The children selected to participate in this trial were the five children in each classroom who obtained the lowest scores on a school-administered app-based assessment of oral language skills (LanguageScreen).The programme focuses on developing children’s narrative, vocabulary, and listening skills, while phonological awareness and letter sound knowledge are also developed during the second half of the programme. Training includes an initial two-day course for TAs followed by a half-day workshop half-way through the programme in addition to ongoing online support. Teachers also receive an initial half-day of training so that they can understand the programme and support TAs. This project was a randomised controlled trial  193 schools participated, 97 of which received the programme while 96 did not, the latter forming the control group.

38111492,Freeman (2008),2008,"Raising reading achievement level remains a national priority for all children in the United States. Recent federal government mandates, such as Early Reading First (2002) and Reading First (Armbruster, Lehr, & Osborn, 2001) have emphasized the importance of preschool and kindergarten in accelerating future achievement. Nearly all recommendations for improving the quality of preschool and kindergarten experience include reading aloud to children. Indeed, included in the joint statement of the International Reading Association and the National Association for the Education of Young Children is the assertion that ""the single most important activity for building understandings and skills essential for reading success appears to be reading aloud to children"" (1998). This study examined the effect of teachers' read-aloud styles on the listening comprehension and vocabulary acquisition of kindergarten students. Combining methods based upon research by Martinez and Teale (1993), Wasik, Bond, and Hindman (2006), Coyne et al. (2004), Lonigan and Whitehurst (1998), Reese & Cox, (1999), and Brabham & Lynch-Brown (2002), two read-aloud styles were formulated. The full model included brief story introductions, teacher comments modeling the process of making inferences during reading, ""rich"" explanations of target vocabulary, open-ended questions focusing upon story events, an after reading summary question, and guided reconstruction. The parsimonious model emphasized vocabulary and questioning with each story combined with a retelling but without the introduction, after reading question, and story reconstruction.

Methods  In a randomized controlled trial, 180 children from 15 UK nursery schools (n = 12 from each setting  M[ age] = 4 0) were randomly allocated to receive a 30-week oral language intervention or to a waiting control group. Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by nursery staff and teaching assistants trained and supported by the research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6-month delay. Results  Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness. Importantly, improvements in oral language skills generalized to a standardized measure of reading comprehension at maintenance test. Conclusions  Early intervention for children with oral language difficulties is effective and can successfully support the skills, which underpin reading comprehension.

Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure  however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies.

Although vocabulary development consistently emerges as a critical literacy skill for young children, many youngsters lag behind in word knowledge because of little exposure to a variety of children's books during their preschool years. Eighty preschool children from suburban preschools, inner-city preschools, and home schools were randomly assigned to a treatment or comparison group where they received either audiobooks or art supplies over 10 weeks. All children involved in the study were given the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Forms A and B) and the Expressive Vocabulary Test in order to measure receptive and expressive vocabulary development. A pretest-posttest design was implemented in order to examine the effects on word knowledge when young children listen independently to audiobooks. Data analysis indicated that the children assigned to the experimental group saw a significant increase their receptive and expressive word knowledge. The children who scored the lowest during the initial pretesting experienced the largest gains after treatment was instituted. Although the frequency with which the treatment group listened to the audiobooks was related to the amount of increase in receptive vocabulary, there was no such correlation for expressive vocabulary development. Other demographic variables were also analyzed with varying results. Parents of the treatment group children overwhelmingly reported their children enjoyed listening to the audiobooks. Based on these results, the following two major conclusions can be drawn  (a) independent listening of children's books on audiotape can significantly increase a preschool child's receptive and expressive vocabulary, and (b) the lower the child's initial vocabulary scores, the greater the gain after treatment has been initiated.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4', '5']",NA,NA,,5,"['Page 40:\n[¬s]""Two inner-city schools, two suburban preschools, and the home school support group met the requirements for participation, indicated interest, and were selected for parent information meetings to determine whether parental interest in having their children involved in the study was present.[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 40:\n[¬s]""Two inner-city schools, two suburban preschools, and the home school support group met the requirements for participation, indicated interest, and were selected for parent information meetings to determine whether parental interest in having their children involved in the study was present.[¬e]""']",,5,"['Page 40:\n[¬s]""Two inner-city schools, two suburban preschools, and the home school support group met the requirements for participation, indicated interest, and were selected for parent information meetings to determine whether parental interest in having their children involved in the study was present.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 25:\n[¬s]""randomized pretest-posttest control group design (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1993).[¬e]""', 'Page 41:\n[¬s]""Eighty-one students were randomly assigned via a randomization table to either the control or experimental group.[¬e]""', 'Page 44:\n[¬s]""The selection of the treatment and comparison groups was accomplished via stratified random sampling, a technique in which a population is divided into mutually exclusive groups, or strata, such as gender and age, and then a random sample is selected from each group (Gall, Gall, & Borg, 1999; Johnson & Christensen, 2000).

38111649,Justice (2005),2005,"Purpose  The extant literature suggests that exposure to novel vocabulary words through repeated readings of storybooks influences children’s word learning, and that adult elaboration of words in context can accelerate vocabulary growth. This study examined the influence of small-group storybook reading sessions on the acquisition of vocabulary words for at-risk kindergartners, and the impact of word elaboration on learning. An additional goal was to study differential responses to treatment for children with high versus low vocabulary skill. Method  Using a pretest–posttest comparison group research design, 57 kindergartners were randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 29) or comparison (n = 28) group. Children were also differentiated into high (n = 31) versus low (n = 26) vocabulary skill groups using scores on a standardized receptive vocabulary test. Children in the treatment group completed 20 small-group storybook reading sessions during which they were exposed to 60 novel words randomly assigned to non-elaborated and elaborated conditions. Pre and posttest examined the quality of children’s definitions for the 60 novel words. Results  Overall, word-learning gains were modest. Children in the treatment group made significantly greater gains in elaborated words relative to children in the comparison group  no influence of storybook reading exposure was seen for non-elaborated words. Children with low vocabulary scores made the greatest gains on elaborated words.

38111681,Justice (2010),2010,"Purpose  This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of teachers' use of a print-referencing style during whole-class read-alouds with respect to accelerating 4- and 5-year-old children's print-knowledge development. It also examined 8 specific child- and setting-level moderatorsto determine whether these influenced the relation between teachers' use of a print-referencing style and children's print-knowledge development. Method  In this randomized controlled trial, 59 teachers were randomly assigned to 2 conditions. Teachers in the experimental group (n = 31) integrated explicit references to specified print targets within each of 120 read-aloud sessions conducted in their classrooms over a 30-week period  comparison teachers (n = 28) read the same set of book titles along the same schedule but read using their business-as-usual reading style. Children's gains over the 30-week period on a composite measure of print knowledge were compared for a subset of children who were randomly selected from the experimental (n = 201) and comparison (n = 178) classrooms. Results  When controlling for fall print knowledge, child age, and classroom quality, children who experienced a print-referencing style of reading had significantly higher print knowledge scores in the spring than did children in the comparison classroom. None of the child-level (age, initial literacy skills, language ability) or setting-level characteristics (program type, instructional quality, average level of classroom socioeconomic status, teachers' education level, teachers' experience) significantly moderated intervention effects.

38111543,Kertoy (1994),1994,"Previous work on story readings has focused on the interaction between children and their parents or teachers. Adult interactive strategies while adults read to children serve to draw the child's attention to the story. However, the impact of specific adult interactive strategies on the complexity and types of comments by children has not been studied extensively. This study was designed to investigate whether the specific strategies of commenting or questioning by the adult would influence the complexity as well the types of spontaneous comments to story details made by children when listening to stories. Twenty four subjects, ranging in age from 3 years, 10 months to 6 years, 5 months, listened to a series of five different stories over a three week period in their preschool classrooms. The preschoolers were assigned to two experimental and one control group. Familiar adults employed commenting, questioning, or general reading, with each group respectively. Children in the comment group produced spontaneous utterances with greater complexity than those children in the question group. The type of interactive strategy employed by the adults also influenced significantly the types of comments made about different aspects of the stories by the children. Commenting by the adults contributed to a greater percentage of child utterances regarding the story meaning while questioning by the adults contributed to a greater percentage of child utterances about the story structure and print.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4', '5', '6']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,1,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" All children had age appropriate speech and language skills and normal hearing on the basis of results of the Fluharty Preschool Speech and Language Screening Test (Fluharty, 1974) and a puretone hearing screening.

Thirty-six children, ages three to five, attending a day care center serving a minority, racial group in a low-economic area were randomly placed into three treatment groups and one control group. All of the subjects were administered three pre-tests and three post-tests. For ten weeks the researcher met with the three treatment groups on a daily basis. Groups One and Two heard the same stories, the difference between the groups being the amount of language interaction initiated by the researcher. Group Three worked freely with art materials. The effect of the reading aloud, language interaction and the interaction of the two were each addressed by the three post-tests. Analysis of covariance was used to measure differences, the covariates being the three pre-tests and ages of the subjects. There were no statistically significant results from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test or Development of Oral Language test. The results from the Concepts About Print test did show a statistically significant effect from reading aloud.

38111683,Mason (1990),1990,"Schools typically place a high value on the dominant middle-class approach to becoming literate  they expect all children to arrive at school familiar with books and able to discuss stories. However, community use of printed materials varies, resulting in a large number of nonmainstream children deemed at risk for school failure at an early age. In an effort to address this situation, a study examined the effects of including shared book reading activities in an urban preschool program that identified at-risk children through assessment of child and family characteristics. A year-long intervention supplemented the regular program with weekly classroom reading and sharing of simple books  use of book topics for writing and dramatic play  and shared book reading by parents and children at home. The study employed a quasi-experimental control design with multiple converging measures of children's knowledge of language and literacy constructs and parent questionnaire responses. Multivariate and univariate analyses revealed that literacy development can be fostered through the incorporation of shared book reading. Pre- and posttest comparisons also revealed that at-risk children can make substantial growth in language development, print concept awareness, letter knowledge, writing, and reading abilities.

38111684,Mautte (1990),1990,"This study examined the effects of adult-interactive behaviors during repeated storybook readings upon the language development and selected prereading skills of prekindergarten At Risk students. A total of 53 inner-city, low socioeconomic status (SES) subjects participated in the 20-week study. Subjects were dichotomized at the median on a measure of development level into average- and delayed-development level groups and were then randomly assigned from each of the two development strata to two experimental groups and to one control group. The subjects in Experimental Group 1 were exposed to adult-interactive behaviors during repeated readings of ""big book"" story-books. Subjects in Experimental Group 2 were exposed to repeated ""big book"" storybook readings without adult interaction. Control group subjects participated in the regular prekindergarten curricular activities. Two separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed on the subjects' scores on the Preschool Language Scale (PLS) and on the Test of Early Reading Ability (TERA). The analysis of the PLS data indicated a significant main effect of treatment (p $<$.0001). Subjects in both experimental groups scored significantly higher than control group subjects, but there was no difference between the two experimental groups. The one-way ANCOVA test for main effects of treatment on the TERA was not statistically significant. Subjects' scores on the PLS and TERA were also subjected to two separate, two-way (development level by treatment) analyses of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVAs confirmed the significant treatment effect on the PLS and nonsignificant treatment effect on the TERA and indicated significant development level effects on both instruments in the expected direction (i.e., average-development level subjects scored significantly higher than delayed-development level subjects). There were no significant interaction effects between development levels and treatments. The results suggested that the language development of low SES prekindergarten students identified as being at risk of academic failure could be enhanced through repeated storybook readings, whether or not the adult who was reading aloud initiated interactive behaviors.

From the total population of 106 four-year-olds, 45 were randomly selected for the experimental group and 45 for the control group. Each group was then subdivided into 15 groups of 3 children each.The children in the experimental group were read a different story at each meeting.The children in the control group met with research assistants and worked on reading read.ness tasks in small groups, focusing on identification of colors, shapes and letters. Research assistants conducted the 2nd and 11th story reading sessions  in both groups as pre- and posttest measures. The stories were introduced, and children were encouraged to ask questions or to comment during the story. The responses of children on the tapes of these sessions provided pre- and posttest data. This investigation revealed that reading to children in small groups with guided adult interactive behavior increased verbal participation and complexity of that verbal interchange. Children in the experimental group asked more questions and made more comments than those in the control group. Small group readings in a school setting can increase low-SES children's question and comment responses to literature in both number and complexity, providing a rich source of informat ion for the child. _MR",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Conference Proceedings,,['Conference paper'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Other educational setting (please specify)'],"['Page 3:\n[¬s]"" day care centers[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,['4'],NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,2,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""The study took place in two day care centers servicing several communities.[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],NA,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""The study took place in two day care centers servicing several communities.\nEligibility to attend the center is bised on financial need The children were classified\nas lower-middle to lower socioeconomic level.

38111672,Simon (2003),2003,"The development of language and literacy skills is vital to future success in our society. Early intervention in critical areas of preschool language (vocabulary, comprehension, and narrative ability) and early literacy skills can facilitate this development. Typical interventions in preschool settings utilize storybooks to target these critical areas. However, research on large group teacher implemented storybook interventions to improve language skills is limited. In this study, Head Start teachers were trained to use a storybook intervention entitled, Storybook Activities for Improving Language (SAIL). The SAIL intervention consisted of four days of teacher led activities built around storybooks incorporating repeated readings, vocabulary activities, and retelling and acting out activities. A main focus was on vocabulary skills with secondary focuses on comprehension, narrative ability, and print awareness. Language and early literacy measures were administered at pre and post test to the SAIL intervention group and a control group. A multivariate analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effectiveness o f SAIL on those measures. A significant effect was found for a vocabulary measure requiring children to name the categories and features o f the target vocabulary words used in the SAIL intervention and for a narrative retell measure requiring children to retell a story within a time limit. There were no significant effects found for vocabulary measures assessing general vocabulary development, comprehension, or print awareness. Based on the results, five conclusions can be drawn  a) the SAIL intervention led to increases in vocabulary skills  b) the SAIL intervention did not lead to increases in comprehension skills  c) the SAIL intervention led to increases in narrative ability  d) SAIL did not lead to increases in print awareness  and e) teachers rated the SAIL intervention favorably upon a program evaluation questionnaire. Despite limitations warranting caution in interpretation, this study added to existing research on storybook interventions in preschool in several ways. First, SAIL showed that a class-wide teacher implemented storybook intervention led to significant gains in vocabulary skills and narrative ability for preschool age children.

Because these children are known to be at risk for later reading comprehension difficulties, it is important to design and test interventions that foster both literal and inferential language skills. Using a randomized pretest-posttest control group design, we investigated whether an 8-week, one-on-one book-sharing intervention would improve both the literal and inferential language skills of Head Start preschoolers with language impairments. Method  Thirty children were randomly assigned to either a control group that received no intervention or to a treatment group that received twice-weekly 15-min sessions in which adults read books and asked both literal and inferential questions about the books using scripts that were embedded throughout the text. Treatment and control groups were compared using pre- and posttest scores on 2 measures of literal and 1 measure of inferential language skill. Results  Significant group differences, and medium to large effect sizes, were found between pre- and posttest scores for all 3 measures.

38111686,Walsh (2009),2009,"This dissertation study employed quantitative methods to investigate the impact of adult questioning styles on children's novel vocabulary acquisition during shared storybook reading. In an effort to examine adult qualitative variations in shared storybook readings, two experiments were conducted to assess the effect of noneliciting questions during shared storybook reading on children's receptive and expressive novel vocabulary learning. The sociocultural perspective was the theoretical framework of this dissertation study and maintains that learning is due to socially meaningful activity of the child within the environment (e.g., Bruner, 1983  Vygotsky, 1978). In the first experiment, 45 children enrolled in monolingual Head Start classrooms were ranked by general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of three conditions  vocabulary noneliciting questions, vocabulary eliciting questions, and no questions (control). In the second experiment, the novel vocabulary learning of 54 children enrolled in a bilingual English-Spanish Head Start program was investigated. In the second experiment, participants were ranked by Spanish general vocabulary scores and randomly assigned to one of four conditions  (1) Spanish vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (2) English vocabulary noneliciting questioning, (3) Spanish labels, and (4) English labels. Experiment 1 utilized the methodological framework employed in previous experimental work on storybook reading  pretest, intervention, and posttest with the addition of a delayed posttest in Experiment 1. Vocabulary noneliciting questions, eliciting questions, and no questions appear to be equally effective. There was no decay of the words learned as determined by delayed post-test. Experiment 2's methodological framework resembles that utilized by Justice (2002) conducted with a monolingual sample. Experiment 2 also utilized other methodological considerations from the existing literature to examine the effects of noneliciting questions on the novel vocabulary learning of bilingual preschoolers. Experiment 2 revealed that English labels are more effective than English noneliciting questions for receptive knowledge. Spanish noneliciting questions lead to greater expressive word learning than Spanish labels. This study has a number of major impacts, including comparison of Experiment 1's results to the extant literature which is instructive  and, while there is a preponderance of literature with monolingual populations, research with bilingual populations is limited, thus Experiment 2 helps to close that gap.",['Oral language interventions'],NA,,Dissertation,,['Dissertation or thesis'],NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Nursery school/pre-school'],NA,NA,,Low ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['3', '4', '5']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 76:\n[¬s]""Vocabulary Eliciting Question condition, the Noneliciting Question condition, and the No Question (control) condition.

The screeni ng measures include recept ive and expressive language mea\xad sures. categorization tasks, and simple counting.

The focus of the intervention was to train teachers how to increase opportunities for language and vocabulary development in young children. At the end of the year, children in the intervention classrooms performed significantly better than children in the control classrooms on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-III and the Expressive One-Word Vocabulary Test (3rd ed.). In addition, teachers in the intervention classrooms used strategies that promoted language development during book reading and other classroom activities.

The children entered the program with language development in standard English vocabulary and expression that was about 10 months behind chronological age on standardized tests. Children were pretested and assigned randomly within classrooms to 1 of 3 conditions  (a) a school plus home condition in which the children were read to by their teachers and their parents, (b) a school condition in which children were read to only by teachers, and (c) a control condition in which children engaged in play activities under the supervision of their teachers. Training of adult readers was based on a self-instructional video. The intervention lasted for 6 weeks, at which point children were posttested on several standardized measures of language ability that had been used as pretests.
