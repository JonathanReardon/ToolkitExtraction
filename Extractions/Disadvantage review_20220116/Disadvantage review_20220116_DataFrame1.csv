This paper reports a new application of the principle to 5‐ and 6‐year‐olds in a disadvantaged inner city area. Aims.To investigate the effect of a cognitive intervention programme on the cognitive development of children in Year 1 of primary schools. Sample.Approximately 300 children in 14 Year 1 classes in 10 schools for the experimental group and 170 children in 8 classes in 5 matched schools as controls. Method.Quasi‐experimental pre‐test post‐test with experimental and matched control groups. One of the pre‐ and post‐tests was intended to probe for transfer. Children in experimental classes experienced a set of 29 activities designed to promote cognitive conflict and encourage social construction and metacognition over one school year. Results.The experimental group overall made significantly greater gains in cognitive development over the period of the experiment than the controls, in both direct (effect size 0.47) and transfer (effect size 0.43) tests, although when genders were considered separately, experimental boys' greater gains than controls did not reach significance. There was no interaction with various social and linguistic variables.

The principal aims of the study were to develop, implement and evaluate a programme for teaching evidence-based justification to vocational education students in Further Education colleges. Teaching was via modelling and peer-based critiquing exercises in the context of the students' project work. Eighty-four Further Education college students underwent a 10-session teaching intervention which dovetailed with their Additional Assessment integrative project work. Students took part in peer-based exercises in which they learned to critique imaginary examples of project outlines and plans,followed by similar peer-based critiquing of each others' proposed projects. Analysis of the students' dialogues with each other indicated that they had learned the importance of justifying arguments, and content analysis of their written work indicated that they engaged in justification of their arguments to a significantly greater degree than control groups. Several key variables in the dialogues correlated positively with justification in the written work,suggesting that the dialogue had impacted on the written work. However, justification tended to be of a weak kind (using anecdotes or experience-based generalisations), and strong (i.e. formal research-based) evidence remained relatively infrequent and sometimes inappropriately used.

Methods of data collection included  (for the whole sample) questionnaires completed by TAs, teachers and head teachers, assessments of pupil attainments in mathematics, English and science, data on pupil background, and (for a sub‐sample) case studies and a systematic observation study. This study found that the TA's role in KS2 is predominantly a direct one, in the sense of face‐to‐face interactions supporting certain pupils. There was no evidence that the presence of TAs, or any characteristic of TAs, had a measurable effect on pupil attainment. However, results were clear in showing that TAs had an indirect effect on teaching, e.g. pupils had a more active form of interaction with the teacher and there was more individualised teacher attention. This supported teachers' views that TAs are effective in supporting them in this way. The authors conclude that more attention needs to be paid to what they call the pedagogical role of TAs so that they can be used effectively to help teachers and pupils, particularly in the context of the enhanced roles for TAs being introduced as part of the Government's remodelling agenda.

This study found that the TA's role in KS2 is predominantly a direct one, in the sense of face‐to‐face interactions supporting certain pupils. There was no evidence that the presence of TAs, or any characteristic of TAs, had a measurable effect on pupil attainment. However, results were clear in showing that TAs had an indirect effect on teaching, e.g. pupils had a more active form of interaction with the teacher and there was more individualised teacher attention. This supported teachers' views that TAs are effective in supporting them in this way. The authors conclude that more attention needs to be paid to what they call the pedagogical role of TAs so that they can be used effectively to help teachers and pupils, particularly in the context of the enhanced roles for TAs being introduced as part of the Government's remodelling agenda.",NA,NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['8', '9', '10', '11']",NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,153,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""153[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,224,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""224[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, not matched prior to treatment","['Page 2:\n[¬s]""Results presented in this article come from the Institute of Education Class Size and Pupil\x96Adult Ratios (CSPAR) Project.

Data linkage was performed with nationally administered school assessments in English, Maths and Science at ages 11, 13 and 16. Results  In unadjusted models, total volume of PA predicted decreased academic attainment. After controlling for total volume of PA, percentage of time spent in moderate-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) predicted increased performance in English assessments in both sexes, taking into account confounding variables. In Maths at 16 years, percentage of time in MVPA predicted increased performance for males (standardised β=0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22) and females (β=0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16).

Methods  Teaching assistants (TAs) were trained to deliver a reading and language intervention to children in individual daily 40-min sessions. We used a waiting list control design, in which half the sample received the intervention immediately, whereas the remaining children received the treatment after a 20-week delay. Fifty-seven children with Down syndrome in mainstream primary schools in two UK locations (Yorkshire and Hampshire) were randomly allocated to intervention (40 weeks of intervention) and waiting control (20 weeks of intervention) groups. Assessments were conducted at three time points  pre-intervention, after 20 weeks of intervention, and after 40 weeks of intervention. Results  After 20 weeks of intervention, the intervention group showed significantly greater progress than the waiting control group on measures of single word reading, letter-sound knowledge, phoneme blending and taught expressive vocabulary. Effects did not transfer to other skills (nonword reading, spelling, standardised expressive and receptive vocabulary, expressive information and grammar). After 40 weeks of intervention, the intervention group remained numerically ahead of the control group on most key outcome measures  but these differences were not significant.

Reciprocal teaching methods encourage children to ‘become the teacher’. They are taught how to apply four comprehension strategies  summarising, clarifying, questioning, and predicting. These strategies enable children to check that they understand the content of the material they are reading and can make inferences based on what they have read. The LIT programme is tightly structured, providing training to staff as well as a set of detailed lesson plans on the use of reciprocal teaching to deliver basic instruction in literacy. However, the method of delivery is not particularly prescriptive. It can be used to teach whole classes or small groups, can be delivered by teachers or teaching assistants, and can be offered in addition to or instead of regular English classes. In this evaluation, children typically received 3–4 hours of LIT tuition per week for eight months, mostly delivered in small groups. The programme was devised by the Hackney Learning Trust, who delivered the training sessions for staff and developed a detailed set of lesson plans for them to follow.

37671548,Dockrell (2015),2015,"""Talk for Writing"" is an approach to teaching writing that emphasizes three teaching methods  (1) 'imitation' (where pupils learn texts by heart, so they can discuss and dissect them)  (2) 'innovation' (where pupils adapt stories to create their own versions)  and (3) 'invention' (where teachers help pupils to create original stories). These tasks aim to improve writing ability by giving pupils an understanding of the structure and elements of written language. This project sought to develop ""Talk for Writing"" into a whole-school programme. The pilot programme ran for 18 months, from January 2013 to July 2014, and involved ten schools in Portsmouth. It included a series of 6 full days for school leadership teams (project teams) plus three whole school conferences (""Big Days"") to train teachers and teaching assistants. It covered all primary age groups from nursery to year 6. In addition to the training and support for schools, the programme provided materials, resources, and guidance for staff development, planning and progression. Each school appointed a ""literacy lead"", who was responsible for implementing the programme. This developmental pilot was subject to an evaluation, which had three aims  (1) to appraise the research literature underpinning key dimensions of the ""Talk for Writing"" pedagogy  (2) to evaluate the promise and feasibility of the programme, and provide formative recommendations to inform future evaluation and development  and (3) to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the potential impact of the programme on writing skills that could be used to inform any future trial. The evaluation took place over twelve months and involved six of the 10 intervention schools, one of which withdrew halfway through the programme following the appointment of a new headteacher, and three comparison schools. There were two comparison schools in Portsmouth and one in London. Key conclusions of the project were  (1) most of the teachers were enthusiastic about implementing Talk for Writing within a whole school approach and felt that it provided a consistent approach to teaching writing. However, one school was withdrawn from the project by a new headteacher  (2) features of the programme were embedded in the classrooms, and teachers generally found the programme straightforward to implement  (3) the project displayed mixed evidence of promise. Teachers reported that it had an impact on pupils' writing skills. However, the literature review found mixed support from the current research base for the principles underlying the programme  (4) further research is required to securely estimate the impact of the approach on academic attainment. It would be valuable to undertake some additional development work to refine the approach before it undergoes a full trial  and (5) other research suggests that oral language may play a stronger role in supporting writing in the early years than in Key Stage 2. The programme might benefit from targeted support of key oral language competencies to support the production of early written text in struggling writers and those with weaker oral language skills.

The second component focused on parental engagement and offered families the opportunity to participate in a series of facilitated workshops where children and parents work together to create an animated film. Sessions were coordinated by a practitioner who helped participants to think about how they are learning, create learning goals and reflect on their progress  to be metacognitive about the learning process they were engaged in together.

Methods This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of a reading and language intervention for 6‐year‐old children identified by research criteria as being at risk of dyslexia (n = 56), and their school‐identified peers (n = 89). An Experimental group received two 9‐week blocks of daily intervention delivered by trained teaching assistants  the Control group received 9 weeks of typical classroom instruction, followed by 9 weeks of intervention. Results Following mixed effects regression models and path analyses, small‐to‐moderate effects were shown on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. However, these were fragile and short lived, and there was no reliable effect on the primary outcome of word‐level reading. Conclusions This new intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions, yet failed to show reliable effects on language and literacy measures following a rigorous evaluation. We suggest that the intervention may have been too short to yield improvements in oral language  and that literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened training effects.

The present research examines the impact of one such approach, Direct Phonics (Wilson and Reason, 2003). Direct Phonics was introduced in 6 schools during 2002-2003 involving 15 teachers and 11 teaching assistants working with 16 groups of children in total. Quantitative data was obtained for a total of 40 children aged between 72 - 89 months, on the following pre and post intervention measures  receptive language as measured by the BPVS, phonological skills as measured by the PhAB, basic word recognition as measured by the WORD, various curriculum-based measures relating to letter and word knowledge. Qualitative data was obtained through discussions with the teaching staff, their observations and records and examples of the pupils' work. Curriculum-based measures drawing on the content of Direct Phonics demonstrated most convincing progress. There were also significant gains in scores on the WORD test but a calculation of effect size did not indicate that the children were 'catching up' with their age peers. It was argued that, in comparison with curriculum-based assessments, standardised tests were 'blunt' measures of progress for children in the beginning stages of literacy learning. Before the intervention, many of the children demonstrated phonological weaknesses on the PhAB test. The children's scores improved significantly on the sample of subtests administered post-intervention. Correlational analysis showed that PhAB scores were not related to children's curriculum-based measures of progress or their progress on the WORD test. BPVS as a baseline measure of receptive vocabulary was significantly related to the curriculum-based outcome measures.

Classes in five UK junior schools were screened to identify children most at risk of reading failure (36 in total, mean initial age 7.6 years). Comparison children, matched overall for age and reading performance, were selected from comparable schools. The selected children were given an individually adaptive, curriculum-based, support programme with the emphasis on word building and phonics skills in the broad reading context. The programme was given to children in pairs for two half-hour sessions per week for 10 weeks. The intervention group made significantly more progress than the comparison group as measured by mean reading standard scores, with an overall ‘effect size’ of 0.67. A 6-month follow-up indicated that the overall effect size of improvement reduced to 0.55. The intervention proved cost-effective, with comparable improvements to those of Reading Recovery at around 20% of the cost. The results suggest that while cost-effective improvements in reading can be achieved at junior school, a significant proportion of junior children will fail to benefit from a relatively short intervention of this type.

Children in the intervention group received 30 weeks of oral language intervention, beginning in nursery (preschool), in three group sessions per week, continuing with daily sessions on transition to Reception class (pre-Year 1). The intervention was delivered by nursery staff and teaching assistants trained and supported by the research team. Following screening, children were assessed preintervention, following completion of the intervention and after a 6-month delay. Results  Children in the intervention group showed significantly better performance on measures of oral language and spoken narrative skills than children in the waiting control group immediately after the 30 week intervention and after a 6 month delay. Gains in word-level literacy skills were weaker, though clear improvements were observed on measures of phonological awareness.

It is delivered on a one to one basis by staff, most commonly teaching assistants, who have been trained in the approach. The purpose of Switch-on is to achieve functional literacy for as many pupils as possible, and so to close the reading achievement gap for vulnerable children working below age-expected levels. It is inspired by the well- established intervention Reading Recovery, which is teacher led and delivered over a 12-20 week period. In this evaluation, the programme involved regular sessions for pupils who had not achieved Level 4 English at Key Stage 2. The identified pupils in Year 7 attended regular 20-minute reading sessions over the course of the Spring term. The students were removed from class to attend the sessions, which aimed to improve their reading comprehension and fluency. Each session required students to read from four different books graded on the basis of their difficulty. Training and support for staff was provided by the Every Child a Reader staff of Nottinghamshire Local Authority. The overall result was an effect size of +0.24, based on the pooled standard deviation of the post-test score for both groups, meaning that the programme made a noticeable positive impact. This effect can be envisaged as suggesting that on average pupils receiving the intervention would make approximately three additional months’ progress over the course of a year compared to similar pupils who did not.

Pupils attending the four-week programme followed a specially designed curriculum involving regular literacy and numeracy lessons taught by trained primary and secondary school teachers. Lessons were supported by mentors and peer-mentors and generally conducted in small teaching groups. Each afternoon, pupils participated in a variety of sports and enrichment activities. The programme took place across three sites in London and the South East  Brighton, Enfield and Islington in the summer of 2013.

The evaluation involved a quasi-experimental evaluation in which 33 students in years 7-9 in four schools used OVIP over an 8 week period and were monitored at three times for their word reading, phonic decoding and phonological skills. Students, teaching assistants and teachers involved were also interviewed about the use of OVIP, the perceived processes and outcomes. Assessment results showed that OVIP was associated with greater gains in word reading than these students' usual teaching/intervention approaches. Those interviewed also experienced benefits associated with using OVIP. It was further found that word reading gains were not related to a measure of being at risk of significant literacy difficulties. Participants identified the use of their own voice, the student's agency and working at their own pace as key factors relevant to how OVIP worked.

Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of a language intervention programme for children identified as having poor oral language skills in preschool classes. Methods & Procedures A randomized controlled trial was carried out in 13 UK nursery schools. In each nursery, eight children ( N = 104, mean age = 3 years 11 months) with the poorest performance on standardized language measures were selected to take part. All but one child were randomly allocated to either an intervention ( N = 52) or a waiting control group ( N = 51). The intervention group received a 15-week oral language programme in addition to their standard nursery curriculum. The programme was delivered by trained teaching assistants and aimed to foster vocabulary knowledge, narrative and listening skills. Outcomes & Results Initial results revealed significant differences between the intervention and control group on measures of taught vocabulary. No group differences were found on any standardized language measure  however, there were gains of moderate effect size in listening comprehension. Conclusions & Implications The study suggests that an intervention, of moderate duration and intensity, for small groups of preschool children successfully builds vocabulary knowledge, but does not generalize to non-taught areas of language. The findings strike a note of caution about implementing language interventions of moderate duration in preschool settings. The findings also highlight the importance of including a control group in intervention studies.

Two teachers from each participating school received five days of professional development training delivered by a team from Science Oxford and Oxford Brookes University. The training did not aim to provide participating teachers with a set of ‘off-the-shelf’ lesson plans to be delivered in schools  rather, it sought to support teachers to be more creative and thoughtful in planning their science lessons. In addition, teachers had dedicated time to work with colleagues to plan and review lessons taught as part of the project. Teachers were also encouraged to link pupils’ learning in science, with their learning in numeracy and literacy. This project sought to assess the impact of the programme on the academic outcomes and attitudes towards science of Year 5 pupils. 655 pupils from 21 schools across England completed the project.

LTSS challenges students’ thinking, develops their metacognitive skills, and encourages cooperative learning. Let’s Think Forum (a registered charity led by a group of academics, teachers, and consultants) created LTSS by adapting a programme called Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE). Let’s Think Forum’s adaptations to CASE included reducing the number of lessons from 30 to 19, reducing the number of scientific principles that are taught, rewriting lesson plans, and providing additional resources like PowerPoint slides and video tutorials.

Methods  A sample (N = 77) of children drawn from 14 schools representing those with the weakest reading skills were randomly allocated to one of two groups. A 20-week intervention group received the intervention for two consecutive 10-week periods, while a 10-week intervention group only received the intervention for the second 10 weeks of the study. The programme was delivered in daily 20-minute sessions that alternated between small group (N = 3) and individual teaching. The programme combined phoneme awareness training, word and text reading, and phonological linkage exercises. Results  The children receiving the intervention during the first 10-week period made significantly more progress on measures of letter knowledge, single word reading, and phoneme awareness than children not receiving the intervention. However, the children who only received the intervention during the second 10-week period made rapid progress and appeared to catch up with the children who had been given the more prolonged intervention. Failure to respond to the intervention was predicted by poor initial literacy skills and being in receipt of free school meals. Conclusion  A reading intervention programme delivered on a daily basis by trained teaching assistants is an effective intervention for children who show reading delays at the end of their first year in school. However, around one-quarter of the children did not respond to this intervention and these children would appear to need more intensive or more prolonged help to improve their reading skills.

41817123,Hole (2013),2013,"The impact on listening difficulties in children due to impaired central auditory processing is currently a topic of considerable interest. This is due to the high reported incidence of deficits in auditory processing ability (the main deficit reported being poor speech discrimination ability in background noise in the classroom setting (Witton, 2010), and potential impact on reading deficits, through poor auditory temporal processing skills impacting on phonological awareness and reading abilities (Tallal et al, 1980  Stein et al, 1997  Goswami, 2011). There is currently a lack of consensus regarding the underlying cause of these listening difficulties, including the impact of higher order cognitive function (attention) and test materials used to diagnose impaired auditory processing function. Despite this lack of consensus, there are currently several commercially available systems claiming to improve reading and listening skills. These include the use of spectrally filtered classical music to reportedly improve neural synchrony of the central auditory system, an example is that of “The Listening Programme® (TLP)” produced by Advanced Brain Technologies. The British Society of Audiology and American Speech and Hearing Association currently report these interventions as experimental with little high quality scientific evidence. The aim of this study to investigate whether TLP® could affect an advance in auditory processing and reading skills in typically developing school age children (aged 8-9 years) compared to non-filtered classical music and a non-music control group. This study used a pseudo-random control trial design involving 21 participants. A series of auditory processing tasks including speech discrimination in noise, auditory attention and Backward Masking (a test of auditory temporal resolution) and reading tasks (including task of phonemic decoding  a test of a participant’s phonological awareness) were performed at pre and post intervention stages. All subjects were of average/above average readers. This study was underpowered and therefore concrete conclusions regarding the efficacy of the use of TLP® to improve auditory processing and reading skills in typically-developing children cannot be made.

37671521,Holmes (2013),2013,"Many children who would not be identified as having special educational needs are low-attaining in mathematics, which often has a severe impact on their progress at school and their successes in later life. This paper describes Catch Up Numeracy, a non-intensive targeted intervention for children who are low-attaining in mathematics, which is delivered by classroom assistants in only thirty minutes per week. Data for 440 children, including controls, show that children receiving Catch Up Numeracy intervention attained average gains more than twice that expected of typically attaining children, and more than twice that attained by children receiving non-targeted mathematics support. The evidence suggests that Catch Up Numeracy is effective for children who are low-attaining in mathematics.

It is a universal intervention and is therefore delivered to all children in a given class by their teacher. Over the course of implementation, it is intended that there is a natural progression in terms of the types of rewards given (from tangible rewards such as stickers to more abstract rewards such as free time), how long the game is played for (from 10 minutes to a whole lesson), at what frequency (from three times a week to every day), and when rewards are given (at the end of the game, the end of the day, and the end of the week). Teachers receive two days of initial training, with one day of follow-up training midway through the first year of implementation. On-going support for implementation is provided by trained GBG coaches employed by the delivery organisation, Mentor UK (who were in turn supported by the American Institutes for Research for this trial). We used a randomised controlled trial design in which 77 schools were randomly allocated to implement the GBG for two years (38 schools) or continue their normal practices (39 schools).

The study was carried out in a primary school nursery class. A mixed methods design was used. Firstly, a quasi experimental method, where 18 participants, aged three to four, received singing intervention, for six sessions, in four small groups and 20 participants were randomly allocated to a control group. The participants were assessed in phonological discrimination, before and after the intervention. Secondly, a qualitative research method, where a semi-structured interview gained the views of the class teacher, in relation to any potential benefits of the intervention and the feasibility of small group singing in future practice. Thirdly, a mosaic approach was used to gather the children’s views of the intervention, underpinned by the important assumption that children are active co constructors in the research process. Statistical analysis, using ANOVA and post hoc tests, revealed a significant gain in phonological discrimination for children in the intervention group, compared to the control group, where there was no gain. Thematic analysis revealed broader benefits of the intervention, in terms of improved communication, motivation, confidence and providing opportunities “to shine”. There appeared to be a value to a small singing group, that could add to existing classroom experience, and that was feasible in practice. Themes that were drawn from the mosaic approach highlighted the importance of paying attention to social learning, enjoyment and building on previous experiences when delivering the intervention. The research concluded, therefore, that both the content of the intervention, as well as the nature of the intervention, are important factors to inform practice.

Teachers are trained to develop and teach challenging, enquiry-based science lessons that incorporate more practical activities, deeper thinking and discussion, and sharply focused recording. Following promising results from an efficacy trial of TDTS (Hanley et al., 2015), this effectiveness trial was commissioned to test its impact when implemented at scale. In this trial, science teachers received the training on four days spread across the school year, and the impact on the pupils in their science classes was measured at the end of the year. The model of TDTS tested here differs from the previous model in three key ways  the number of teacher training days was reduced from five to four  funding for two additional days of preparation per teacher (in the form of cover costs) was cut  and the programme also used a ‘train the trainer’ model in which CPD was led by pairs of experts who were trained in the TDTS model by the programme authors, rather than the authors training teachers directly (trainers were delivering the training to schools for the first time during the trial). The study used a two-arm cluster randomised controlled design  205 schools were randomised to either receive TDTS or to be part of a ‘business as usual’ waitlist control group  233 Year 5 teachers at 102 intervention schools received the training. The evaluation focused on the impact of TDTS on the educational attainment of pupils, as measured through a standardised science assessment. The study also used a survey to measure pupil interest in, and self-efficacy toward, science.

Across the project, 16 coaches were employed to provide academic support to pupils who had not reached level 4c in English at the end of Key Stage 2. Originally it had been intended that pupils would only receive one to one support, and that all coaches would be graduates. However, in practice pupils received a range of targeted support that varied between schools and most, but not all, coaches were graduates. The programme built on a successful pilot in Perry Beeches Academy in Birmingham, and the school co-ordinated the project across participating schools. The approach was based on a one to one coaching programme used in Match Charter School in Boston, USA.

Specifically it evaluates a reading intervention programme devised by educational psychologists and delivered by teaching assistants specially trained by a psychologist. The article assesses the extent to which a psychologist, working through school personnel, added value to the education process within participating schools, the nature of that value and the challenges that had to be overcome. Results showed significant group level improvements in word recognition abilities amongst readers with delayed reading, although the extent of these improvements varied according to school and age with older pupils benefiting more than younger ones. Girls gained more than boys, but this difference was not statistically significant. It was also demonstrated that the programme could be delivered to schools on a low budget including the training of school personnel and taught effectively by non-professional teachers with minimum disruption. It was concluded that the service-delivery approach taken was in keeping with the new expectations of professional educational psychologists and as such provides a useful model for others operating in a changing service context.

Four 15-minute sessions per week are delivered by a teaching assistant (TA) to groups of three to five pupils. This report summarizes the findings of a randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of ABRA on literacy outcomes for Year 1 pupils. The trial also assesses the impact of an offline, paper and pencil version of the same intervention (referred to here at ""the non-Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) intervention""). There were 51 participating schools and 2,241 pupils at randomization, and a total of 48 schools and 1,884 pupils were included in the final analysis (84% of the initial pupils at randomization). The trial took place between October 2014 and May 2015. Fifty-one schools were randomly assigned to either receive some version of the intervention or to act as a ""control"" school delivering business as usual. In the schools receiving the intervention, pupils were randomized to receive one of the following options  (1) ABRA, (2) the non-ICT intervention, and (3) standard literacy provision. The process evaluation involved observing sessions to understand a variety of factors in the intervention. These included an evaluation of which elements contributed to successful implementation, the perceptions and experiences of TAs and project leads, levels of pupil engagement, and the mechanisms behind the estimated impacts. This was an efficacy study, due to the involvement of the developer in the delivery of the program. Key conclusions of this report are  (1) The children who received ABRA, or its offline alternative were found to make two and three months' progress in literacy respectively compared to the children who received standard provision. This positive result would be unlikely to occur by chance  (2) For both ABRA and the offline alternative, the impact for children eligible for free school meals and children with below average pre-test outcomes was larger than for all pupils  (3) Successful implementation contributed to a well-designed and delivered training program which emphasized fidelity and consistency, enforced by ongoing support from the project team  (4) The process evaluation found that both the ICT and non-ICT interventions may be best delivered in groups of similar rather than mixed ability. The process evaluation also suggested minor changes to the intervention to make it more culturally relevant to British pupils, and to remove some repetition in the non-ICT program  and (5) Future research will examine whether ABRA or the non-ICT intervention can be successfully delivered at scale, and will look at longer-term impacts through assessing Key Stage 1 data from this trial.

However, this effect size was lower than the minimum detectable effect size of the trial, so we cannot confidently conclude that the effect was due to the intervention and did not occur by chance  (2) The secondary outcome measures indicated positive impacts on children's literacy skills, but these were not statistically significant  (3) This intervention is recommended to take place during the school day, when it is easier to secure sustained co-operation and support from school staff. Where that support was present, the intervention was able to progress more satisfactorily than in schools where it was lacking  (4) Schools should ensure that people delivering the intervention receive training in the Butterfly method so that it is implemented as intended  and (5) Further research could investigate the intervention's impact on early readers.

The study had two aims  (1) to explore the feasibility of adapting a programme of physical activity and implementing it in the classroom setting, and (2) to explore the feasibility of a future, large-scale trial to provide a proper, robust test of the impact of the programme in improving attainment. Within each of six primary schools, Years 4 and 5 were randomly allocated to either intervention or control groups (472 pupils in total). This was a post-test only design and data was collected in July and October 2014. A process evaluation was conducted alongside the trial in order to provide data on programme implementation and to capture the perceptions and experiences of key stakeholders' engagement with the programme. Key areas explored were the quality of implementation of the intervention, fidelity, and perceived programme outcomes. All headteachers, as well as intervention and control teachers in participating schools, were invited to take part. Three focus groups were conducted with 6-10 children in each. Key conclusions include  (1) Evidence for the feasibility of implementing Physically Active Lessons in the classroom is mixed  both teachers and children reported enjoying the programme, however, the programme created a lot of additional work for teachers and thus, enthusiasm tended to fade towards the end of the study  (2) Teachers found the training enjoyable and helpful, however, they reported that it was sometimes difficult and often time consuming to develop lesson plans and think of ways to integrate physical activity into lessons, especially literacy lessons  (3) More work is needed to develop the programme before it is ready to be tested using a full trial. Additional work is required to develop a programme manual and integrate additional support mechanisms for teachers throughout the delivery period of the intervention  and (4) If the programme is taken to a full effectiveness trial it is recommended that paper-based tests are used, additional explanatory variables are measured, and randomisation can successfully occur at the year-group level.

38296654,Motteram (2016),2016,"The ReflectED programme was developed by Rosendale Primary School to improve pupils’ metacognition—their ability to think about and manage their own learning. This includes the skills of setting and monitoring goals, assessing progress, and identifying personal strengths and challenges. ReflectED consists of 28, weekly, half-hour lessons, which teach pupils strategies they can use to monitor and manage their own learning. Pupils are supported to apply and practise these strategies throughout the rest of the curriculum  reflect on their learning  and record audio, photographed and written notes of their reflections on Evernote, a note-taking app. Pupils are then encouraged to review and reflect on these records over time, so that they can observe their progress and consider which strategies seemed to work well. Teachers can also look across these records to get an overview of the areas that pupils are enjoying or struggling with, and identify specific pupil needs. For example, a teacher could explore the notes that a pupil has tagged as “maths” and “difficult” to see which ones they struggled with, and examine which strategies seemed to help them with this. In this project, Rosendale Primary School trained teachers from 30 schools in five areas throughout England to deliver ReflectED over the academic year 2014/15. At the beginning of the year, participating teachers received a pack of lesson plans and supporting resources, and an initial day- long training session. This was followed by three additional half-day training sessions throughout the year. A website, digital resources, and weekly reminders and tips were provided by the London Connected Learning Centre. The National Education Trust supported school recruitment and test administration. The programme was co-funded by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), KPMG Foundation and Nominet Trust, and was part of a funding round focused on digital technology. The impact of the programme on the attainment of pupils in Year 5 was evaluated using a randomised control trial involving 1858 pupils. Year 5 teachers within each of the 30 schools were randomly allocated to either participate in the programme or to a control group which continued with their usual teaching. The primary outcome measure was pupils’ maths attainment. The evaluation also examined the impact on pupil’s reading attainment and attitudes towards reading and maths, and the impact on the maths attainment of pupils eligible for free school meals. Class observations, interviews and focus groups were conducted to examine how the programme was implemented and adapted by teachers, explore activity in the control group, and identify factors that might affect the impact of the programme.

The central question addressed in this paper is how best to teach new vocabulary items to these children. Aims To investigate the effects of two different methods of teaching vocabulary on both vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension. Methods & Procedures Twenty four children aged 7 8 years with poor existing vocabulary knowledge took part in an intervention study. Half the children were taught new vocabulary items using definitions the other half were taught a strategy for deriving meanings from written context. Tests of vocabulary knowledge were given before teaching, immediately after teaching and 3 months later. Outcomes & Results Immediately after teaching, both groups had improved equivalently in vocabulary knowledge for the taught words. However, 3 months later, the context group showed significantly better expressive vocabulary knowledge. The context group went on to show significantly better comprehension of text containing a number of the taught words and demonstrated that they could use the newly acquired strategy independently to derive meanings from written context.

The ECC team trained teaching assistants (TAs) to deliver highly scripted lessons to small groups of up to four children. The programme is normally implemented outside of mathematics lessons in other lesson time. It covers five basic mathematics topics  the number system, place value, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The lessons include the teaching of procedures (for example, counting on, counting up to, counting backwards, and counting in twos and in fives), mathematical signs (+, -, =) and mathematical language and concepts (such as more, less, and equal). Schools are advised to deliver 30 lessons of approximately half an hour, usually three times a week for ten weeks, and are encouraged to deliver additional sessions for pupils who need them. A classroom teacher colleague (the “Link Teacher”) is expected to meet the TA once a week to help them review and plan upcoming lessons, and provide feedback. 1stClass@Number was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial. 133 schools in South and West Yorkshire each nominated four children in Year 2 to participate in the project. The schools were then randomly assigned either to receive the intervention or to continue with their normal teaching in Year 2 and receive the opportunity to implement another ECC intervention with a different year group. The primary outcome for the trial was the Quantitative Reasoning Test, which focuses on number knowledge and mathematical problem solving, and the secondary outcome was performance in end-of-KS1 maths tests.

Between two and four TAs in each school were trained to deliver the interventions by a team of trainers who were distinct from the developers. TAs received 1.5 days training for Switch-on Reading, and 2.5 days for Switch-on Reading and Writing. Each TA worked with between two and four Year 3 pupils who had not met age-related expectations in literacy at the end of Key Stage 1, and who did not have a high level of special needs. In total, 999 pupils were involved in the trial. The primary outcome measure was the Hodder Group Reading Test 2A. The evaluation was conducted over the 2015/2016 academic year. A process and implementation evaluation was carried out which included depth telephone interviews with the developers, trainers, and TAs, and six case studies incorporating the views of TAs, class teachers, and Switch-on co-ordinators in the school.",NA,NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['7', '8']",NA,NA,,126,"['Page 23:\n[¬s]""Switch-on (school n=126[¬e]""']",,58,"['Page 23:\n[¬s]""Control (school n=58[¬e]""']",,184,"['Page 23:\n[¬s]""Randomised (school n=184[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['No'],NA,"Asked to code switch-on reading and switch-on reading and writing separately so in each case there are two treatment groups, intervention and control  however limited information about sample for each separate group - and numbers do not seem to match overall sample",,Random (please specify),"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Each of the 184 participating schools were randomly assigned to receive either Switch-on Reading, Switch-on Reading and Writing, or continue their usual practices of supporting pupils with reading difficulties (called ‘business as usual’ control).[¬e]""']",NA,,School - cluster,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""184 participating schools were randomly assigned[¬e]""']",NA,,['Cluster RCT'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Each of the 184 participating schools were randomly assigned to receive either Switch-on Reading, Switch-on Reading and Writing, or continue their usual practices of supporting pupils with reading difficulties (called ‘business as usual’ control).

52131665,Reynolds (2007),2007,"This study reports the results of a long-term follow-up of an exercise-based approach to dyslexia-related disorders (Reynolds, Nicolson, & Hambly, Dyslexia, 2003  9(1)  48-71), In the initial study, children at risk of dyslexia were identified in 3 years of a junior school. One half then undertook a 6 month, home-based exercise programme. Evaluation after 6 months indicated that the exercise group improved significantly more than the controls on a range of cognitive and motor skills. Critics had suggested that the improvement might be attributable to artifactual issues including Hawthorne effects  an initial literacy imbalance between the groups  and inclusion of non-dyslexic participants. The present study evaluated the issue of whether the gains were maintained over the following 18 months, and whether they were in some sense artifactual as postulated by critics of the original study. Comparison of (age-adjusted) initial and follow-up performance indicated significant gains in motor skill, speech/language fluency, phonology, and working memory. Both dyslexic and non-dyslexic low achieving children benefited. There was also a highly significant reduction in the incidence of symptoms of inattention. Interestingly there were no significant changes in speeded tests of reading and spelling, but there was a significant improvement in (age-adjusted) reading (NFER). It is concluded that the gains were indeed long-lasting, and that the alternative hypotheses based on potential artifacts were untenable, and that the exercise treatment therefore achieved its applied purpose. Further research is needed to determine the underlying reasons for the benefits. Possible (and potentially synergistic) explanations include  improved cerebellar function (neural level)  improved learning ability and/or attentional ability (cognitive level)  improved self-esteem and self-efficacy (affective level)  and improved parental/familial support (social level).

It is based on the idea that feedback in sports coaching is often provided immediately after a task is performed, and delivered in a way that children are more likely to respond positively to. The training programme adopted a 'cascade' model  expert teachers were trained in the approach and then expected to disseminate their training to English and Maths teachers in their school. PLC was developed in the UK secondary school context by the Youth Sport Trust (YST) in collaboration with the University of Exeter. This feasibility pilot study was conducted in 20 schools between January 2014 and November 2014. It had two aims  (1) to explore whether the programme is feasible and ready for a full-scale trial, and (2) to explore the effect on children's attainment and other outcomes of the programme. Key conclusions include  (1) There was no evidence that the programme had an impact on English attainment  (2) The evaluation detected a positive impact on Maths attainment, but this result is not secure and we are not able to draw firm conclusions about the programme's impact  (3) Interviews and observations with teachers found the programme was implemented in different ways and with different levels of understanding in different schools. This could be avoided by ensuring the programme and its underpinning concepts are more clearly defined  (4) The intervention is not ready to be evaluated using a large-scale trial without further development. In particular, it is important that the programme is more clearly defined and less open to interpretation by teachers  and (5) If the programme is taken to a full trial it is recommended that paper-based tests are used. The pilot provided mixed evidence of promise. There was no evidence that PLC had an impact on English attainment. The evaluation did detect an impact on Maths attainment, which was equivalent to six additional months' progress over the course of a year. However, it is important to note that these results, particularly the Maths result, should be treated with caution. The evaluation did not provide evidence of a differential impact on pupils eligible for free school meals or pupils with a low prior attainment. The evaluation provided mixed evidence regarding the programme's feasibility. The training was well attended by teachers and they appeared to be engaged.

Schools receive three half-day training sessions for the Teaching Assistants (TAs) who deliver the intervention and their designated Catch Up® Literacy coordinator in their school, as well as materials to support the one-to-one sessions. The project was a randomised controlled trial. One hundred and fifty six primary schools were randomised to receive Catch Up® Literacy or to continue with their existing practices and act as Business as Usual (BaU) control schools. All the schools nominated up to 12 pupils in Years 4 or 5 (aged eight to ten years old) who were underperforming or struggling with literacy. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the effect of Catch Up® Literacy over existing practice - ‘Business as Usual’ - for these pupils. The evaluation sought to answer the primary research question  what is the impact of Catch Up® Literacy on Year 4 and Year 5 pupils’ reading comprehension skills as measured by the Hodder Group Reading Test (HGRT). The implementation and process evaluation drew on observations of training sessions, surveys of TAs and coordinators, and telephone interviews in Catch Up® schools and a termly activity log for the BaU control schools.",NA,NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['8', '9', '10']",NA,NA,,75,"['Page 18:\n[¬s]"" 75 intervention schools[¬e]""']",,77,"['Page 18:\n[¬s]""77 control schools[¬e]""']",,152,"['Page 18:\n[¬s]""152 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['No'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" One hundred and fifty six primary schools were randomised to receive Catch Up® Literacy or to continue with their existing practices and act as Business as Usual (BaU) control schools.[¬e]""']",NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 12:\n[¬s]""Primary schools that were not already delivering Catch Up® Literacy or Catch Up® Numeracy were eligible to take part in the trial.

38296668,Rutt (2014),2014,"Catch Up® Numeracy is a one to one intervention for learners who are struggling with numeracy. It consists of two 15-minute sessions per week, delivered by teaching assistants (TAs). The approach is based on research indicating that numeracy is not a single skill, but a composite of several component skills that are relatively discrete. The intervention breaks numeracy down into ten elements, including counting verbally, counting objects, word problems and estimation. Pupils are assessed on each component and instruction is targeted on those areas requiring development. In this evaluation, the intervention was run for 30 weeks and delivered to Year 2-6 pupils who were struggling with numeracy, as identified by TAs. The Catch Up Numeracy intervention was compared to a ‘business as usual’ control group and a ‘time equivalent’ intervention group, who received the same amount of one to one teaching by TAs, but did not use Catch Up Numeracy. Those TAs delivering Catch Up Numeracy were supplied with detailed session plans and received three half-day training sessions, led by Catch Up and Dr Ann Dowker of the University of Oxford. The project ran from September 2012 to July 2013. The overall effect size of Catch Up Numeracy in comparison to the ‘business as usual’ control group was +0.21, meaning the programme led to a noticeable improvement in numeracy outcomes. This effect size suggests that, on average, pupils receiving the interventions would make approximately three additional months of progress over the course of the year compared to pupils that did not. However, the ‘time equivalent’ group also showed similar significant gains (+0.27), suggesting the effect is likely to be a result of regular and sustained one to one teaching, rather than an intrinsic benefit of Catch Up Numeracy. The study demonstrates that one to one teaching with TAs is an effective strategy to increase numeracy skills in Year 2-6 pupils. Sub-group analysis did not identify any differential effects for pupil gender or eligibility for free school meals. The process evaluation indicated that most TAs valued Catch Up Numeracy and believed it had a positive impact on pupils’ confidence, engagement with learning and willingness to attempt numeracy problems.",NA,NA,,Report,,['Technical report'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England', 'Wales']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11']",NA,NA,,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,54,"['Page 9:\n[¬s]"" involved 54 schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,['not_provided'],Not provided,NA,,['Yes (Please specify)'],"['Page 6:\n[¬s]""hree groups: a control group that received normal teaching, a Catch Up Numeracy intervention group that received the intervention as described above, and an ‘equivalent time’ group that received two 15 minute sessions a week without Catch Up Numeracy, to replicate the one to one nature of the intervention.[¬e]""']",NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 13:\n[¬s]""This was a pupil-randomised trial but the randomisation was stratified by school.[¬e]""', 'Page 9:\n[¬s]"" Teaching assistants were randomised to one of two intervention groups: one delivering a time equivalent intervention and the other delivering the Catch Up intervention.

Results showed greater phonological onset-rime skills, lettersound knowledge and non-word reading skills in all LSA-taught intervention groups.

38296671,See (2018),2018,"Maths Counts aims to raise the attainment of children who struggle with basic mathematics at Key Stage 2. The intervention was developed by The Mead Community Primary School drawing on the principles of the Numbers Count programme developed by Every Child Counts at Edge Hill University. Maths Counts lessons last 30 minutes and take place at least three times a week for a minimum of ten weeks. Schools have access to an online tool that stores information about pupils’ progress, supports the planning of lesson objectives, and suggests activities and resources for each lesson. The first ten minutes of Maths Counts lessons focus on recall and reinforcement of prior learning, and the following 20 minutes introduce new knowledge and skills. The online tool suggests activities and resources to use, such as throwing and catching a soft football in order to count in sequenced steps or using coins to develop an understanding of money. In this project, schools selected pupils in Years 3 to 6 to participate in the intervention, prioritising pupils at risk of not achieving nationally expected levels, younger pupils, and pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium. The intervention was delivered on a one-to-one basis by teaching assistants. Schools were able to approach the timetabling of the intervention flexibly, so some lessons were scheduled during maths lessons while some took place elsewhere in the school day. Teaching assistants were supported by their schools’ maths leads (the school’s maths co-ordinator or specialist teacher). Support for delivery of the intervention was provided by the Mead Academy Trust project team. Before the intervention started, the project team provided two days of training for both maths leads and teaching assistants. The maths leads then delivered four further training sessions throughout the intervention to the teaching assistants in their school. After an initial development phase where the project team developed a website and the online tool, Maths Counts was evaluated by Durham University using a randomised controlled trial involving 291 pupils across 35 schools. Each school identified eight eligible pupils, four of whom were randomised to receive the intervention while the other four formed the ‘business as usual’ comparison group.

Children in primary school also attend an additional two 15-minute individual sessions per week. All sessions focus on listening, narrative and vocabulary skills. Work on phonological awareness is introduced in the final ten weeks. The intervention was developed by researchers from the University of York with funding from the Nuffield Foundation. The communications charity I CAN was enlisted to train teaching assistants and nursery staff to deliver the programme. This report evaluates the I CAN-led model for the 30-week programme described above and also a shorter 20-week version delivered only in reception year. The impact of these two programmes on the language skills of 350 children in 34 schools was tested using a randomised controlled trial design. Schools with attached nursery schools or nursery classes in Yorkshire and the South East were recruited to the trial in 2013. Children identified as having relatively low language skills were randomly allocated to the 30-week programme, the 20-week programme or standard provision. The qualitative fieldwork carried out as part of the project involved interviews with a total of 12 staff in 8 of the 34 participating schools. Key conclusions include  (1) The Nuffield Early Language Intervention had a positive impact on the language skills of children in the trial. This is true for both the more expensive, 30-week version, starting in nursery, and the 20-week version, delivered only in school  (2) Children receiving the 30-week version experienced the equivalent of about four months of additional progress, compared with about 2 months additional progress for the 20-week version. Both results are unlikely to have occurred by chance, though results for the 30-week version are more secure  (3) The evaluation did not provide reliable evidence that either version of the programme had a positive impact on children's word-level literacy skills  (4) Teaching assistants delivering the programme reported that they found it difficult to devote enough time to it, and that support from senior staff was required to protect the programme time  and (5) Staff in participating schools reported that the programme had a positive impact on children's language skills and confidence. They thought that the factors which contributed to this included the small-group format, the activities covered, and the focus on narrative and vocabulary work.

38296677,Siddiqui (2014),2014,"This pilot project focused on improving teachers’ understanding and use of effective feedback. Participating teachers tried to incorporate feedback into their lessons to help pupils understand their learning goals and become able to develop strategies to reach them. The project employed a cyclical action research design, through which teachers reviewed academic literature on effective feedback before developing ways to apply it in the classroom. The project took place over one school year and involved nine treatment and five comparator schools in the London Borough of Bexley. All pupils in Years 2-6 took part in the study. Existing international research suggests that improving the quality of feedback in the classroom has the potential to improve learning significantly. However, studies also highlight the difficulties in improving feedback in practice, and there are few clear examples of how to improve feedback in English schools. This project sought to develop a way of improving feedback led by schools. The pilot evaluation had three aims. First, to assess the feasibility and promise of an approach to improving feedback which required schools to review, understand and apply research findings, including academic papers. Second, to provide formative recommendations that could be used to improve the approach in the future. Third, to provide an initial quantitative assessment of the approach’s impact on academic attainment that could be used to inform any future trial. The approach is feasible and there are some indications of promise. All nine schools completed the action research programme and at the end of the year many staff were receptive and enthusiastic about the approach. A number of good lessons with clear use of feedback strategies were observed. However, in common with existing studies on feedback, there was wide variation in the way that strategies to improve feedback were used. The estimated impact findings showed no difference between the intervention schools and the other primary schools in Bexley in terms of annual progress towards Level 4 at Key Stage 2 or in terms of value-added progress scores. However, due to the non-random nature of the comparison and the small number of schools involved it is difficult to draw conclusions with this. The results should not be confused with those of a full trial. Pupils eligible for free school meals made more progress in participating schools than in comparison schools.

Dylan Wiliam and Siobhan Leahy, who are experts in formative assessment, designed the intervention and associated materials. The Schools, Students and Teachers network (SSAT), an independent membership organisation, delivered the project. Schools received detailed resource packs to run monthly workshops known as Teacher Learning Communities (TLCs). Each TLC was expected to last 75–90 minutes. All teaching staff were involved and split into groups comprising 8–14 people. TLC agendas and materials focused on five key formative assessment strategies  ‘clarifying, sharing and understanding learning intentions’  ‘engineering effective classroom discussions and activities’  ‘providing feedback that moves learning forward’  ‘activating learners as instructional resources for one another’  and ‘activating learners as owners of their own learning’. Within each of these high-level concepts, the TLC handouts introduced multiple formative assessment techniques for teachers to consider. In-between workshop sessions, teachers were expected to conduct peer lesson observations and provide feedback to each other. Each school appointed a lead teacher who attended an initial training day and received ongoing implementation support from an SSAT Lead Practitioner. This included a mixture of visits, phone calls, e-mails, and access to an online community. The project was a randomised controlled trial.

38296685,Styles (2014),2014,"Chatterbooks is an extracurricular reading initiative that aims to increase a child’s motivation to read by providing schools with tools and resources to encourage reading for pleasure. The intervention developed for this trial consisted of nine weekly one hour sessions where the pupils read and discussed an age-appropriate book. The programme was delivered by trained graduates to Year 7 pupils who had not reached a secure Level 4 in English at the end of Key Stage 2. Chatterbooks was developed by the Reading Agency as an extracurricular activity, organised in local libraries on Saturday mornings by volunteers. The sessions are intended for six to twelve-year-olds and attendance is voluntary. For the purposes of this evaluation, the Chatterbooks programme was altered significantly to test its impact in a more structured and formalised school environment. A variation called Chatterbooks Plus was delivered alongside the Chatterbooks programme. In this intervention, fifteen minutes of a sixty minute session were replaced with dialogic reading where children read aloud and were offered explicit prompts. The target population for this evaluation was pupils in secondary schools in an area of the Midlands accessible from Coventry University. The programme was delivered by trained graduates at Coventry University who had received training from the Reading Agency and Professor Clare Wood (for the dialogic reading component). Intervention delivery took place from April to June 2013. Chatterbooks aims to encourage reading for pleasure. It is assumed that this translates into an improvement in reading ability. This evaluation set out to measure what impact the scheme had on reading ability as measured by the GL Assessment New Group Reading Test. The evaluation was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of 23 projects focused on literacy catch-up at the primary-secondary transition. It was one of four programmes funded with a particular focus on reading comprehension. There was no evidence of impact of either Chatterbooks or Chatterbooks Plus on pupils’ reading ability either immediately after the interventions or at a three-month follow-up. The headline findings suggest that Chatterbooks and Chatterbooks Plus had a slightly negative impact on reading ability with effect sizes of -0.14 and -0.01 respectively. However, they are not statistically significant, suggesting that the difference in outcomes between the control and intervention group occurred by chance.

42025497,Sylva (2008),2008,"Background. Low levels of literacy and high levels of behaviour problems in middle childhood often co‐occur. These persistent difficulties pose a risk to academic and social development, leading to social exclusion in adulthood. Although parent‐training programmes have been shown to be effective in enabling parents to support their children's development, very few parent interventions offer a combination of behavioural and literacy training. Aims. This paper (1) reports on a prevention programme which aimed to tackle behaviour and literacy problems in children at the beginning of school, and (2) presents the effects of the intervention on children's literacy. Sample. One hundred and four 5‐ and 6‐year‐old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods. This is a randomized control trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention. The behavioural intervention consisted of the ‘Incredible Years’ group parenting programme combined with a new programme designed to train parents to support their children's reading at home. Results. Analyses demonstrated a significant effect of the intervention on children's word reading and writing skills, as well as parents' use of reading strategies with their children. Conclusion. A structured multicomponent preventive package delivered with attention to fidelity can enable parents to support their children's reading at home and increase their literacy skills.

37133980,Topping (2004),2004,"Outcomes for methods to accelerate thinking skills involving some peer interaction have been more consistently positive than those for purely teacher-directed or materials-led methods. However, methods involving mainly or only peer interaction are rare. This paper describes and evaluates such a method for peer tutoring in thinking skills, which scaffolds interactive discourse based on a differentiated real book the tutorial pair has chosen to read together. This pilot study aimed to partial the impact on quality of thinking of a peer-tutored thinking intervention from that of a peer-tutored reading intervention, controlling for time on task and amount of peer interactivity. Experimental peer tutees were a whole class (n=28) of seven-year-olds  experimental tutors a whole class (n=31) of 11-year-olds. Comparison tutees were a whole class (n=27) of seven-year-olds  comparison tutors a whole class (n=30) of 11-year-olds. Classes/teachers within the same school were randomly assigned to conditions. In Phase 1, a paired reading intervention was implemented for six weeks for all groups. In Phase 2, the experimental classes of tutors and tutees engaged in the ""paired thinking"" (PT) method for 10 weeks, while the comparison group continued with paired reading. Both treatments involved one 20-minute session weekly. Pre- and post-test assessment of thinking skills and attitude to reading for all participants was conducted and post hoc subjective feedback gathered from participants. The experimental (PT) tutees showed significantly better performance in thinking skills than comparison (PR only) tutees, and some evidence of improved attitudes to reading. However, this was not true for the experimental (PT) tutors. Subjective feedback was very positive from the PT tutees and class teachers, but less positive from the PT tutors. Given the brevity and low cost in time and resources of the treatment, the finding of significant differences in measured thinking skills for the PT tutees is considered encouraging.

In primary schools, these desiderata are difficult to supply through direct teacher instruction, but might be feasible through interactive peer tutoring. This study aimed to evaluate cognitive and affective gains from cross-age peer tutoring for both tutees and tutors in science, using the ""paired science"" programme. For the first time this programme was used to focus on peer rather than parent tutoring and on junior school rather than early years pupils, and for the first time an objective measure of cognitive gain in science was used. Experimental peer tutees were a whole class (n = 32) of seven- to eight-year-olds  tutors a whole class (n = 33) of eight- to nine-year-olds in the same school. A parallel composite class of seven- to nine-year-olds (n = 24) served as controls for tutees and tutors. A peer tutoring paired science intervention was implemented for two 30-minute sessions per week for eight weeks. Video and observational data indicated implementation integrity was satisfactory. Pre- and post-project assessments of understanding of scientific concepts and keywords of a random sample of tutees, tutors and their respective controls (4 × n = 10) were conducted. Additionally, the attitudes of all the tutees, tutors and their teachers towards their experiences were explored by post hoc questionnaire. On pre-post assessments of understanding of scientific concepts and keywords, the experimental group made significant gains while the control group made no gains, yielding effect sizes greater than one, Tutees made greater gains than tutors.

37116207,Topping (2011),2011,"Background  Large-scale randomised controlled trials (RCT) are relatively rare in education. The present study was an attempt to scale up previous small peer tutoring projects, while investing only modestly in continuing professional development for teachers. Purpose  A two-year RCT of peer tutoring in mathematics was undertaken in one local education authority in Scotland. The relative effectiveness of cross-age vs same-age tutoring, light vs intensive intervention, and mathematics vs mathematics + reading tutoring was investigated. Programme description  The intervention was Duolog Math, a freely available tutoring method for working with mathematical problems, involving discussion following eight structured steps and including summarising and generalising at the end. Sample  Eighty-six primary schools in one council in Scotland of average socioeconomic status. Children were of mixed ability and mixed gender, with few ethnic minorities or special needs in relation to background population. Macroevaluation n = 3520. Micro-evaluation Year 1 n = 334, Year 2 n = 447 cf. comparison group n = 85. Design and methods  Almost all the primary schools in the local authority participated and were randomly allocated to condition. A macro-evaluation tested and retested using Performance Indicators in Primary Schools over a two-year period. A micro-evaluation tested and retested within each year using a criterion-referenced test of mathematical problem solving. Macro-evaluation was with multi-level modelling, micro-evaluation with descriptive statistics and effect sizes  ANCOVA and MANOVA. Results  Macro-evaluation yielded significant pre-post gains in mathematics attainment for cross-age tutoring in randomly allocated classes over both years. No other differences were significant. Micro-evaluation yielded pre-post gains for selected schools in Year 1, but no overall gains for randomly allocated schools in Year 2 compared with comparisons. However, Year 2 girls, mathematics-only groups and less able students did gain significantly. Conclusions  Duolog Math tutoring does lead to gains in mathematics attainment compared with students not participating, but only for cross-age tutoring and girls, mathematics-only groups and less able mathematicians. Effectiveness varies according to type of tutoring (cross-age being better) and type of school (selected schools being better), but not intensity of tutoring. The results of the different forms of evaluation were indeed different. © 2011 NFER.",NA,NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],"['Page 2:\n[¬s]""Educational Research Vol. 53, No. 1, March 2011, 51–63[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Scotland', 'UK (Select all that apply)']",,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 7:\n[¬s]""The intervention involved either 7–8- or 10–11-year-old students or both, so classes involved were determined with no accommodation to teacher preference.[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 4:\n[¬s]"" The project set out to train teachers in a particular scaﬀolded method to deliver their assigned condition of tutoring.[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""Normally teachers train tutors and tutees in the ﬁrst four relatively easy steps together.

38296692,Torgerson (2014),2014,"The Discover Summer School was a four-week programme which aimed to improve the reading and writing skills of children during the summer between Year 6 and Year 7. The programme was targeted at pupils who had been predicted to achieve below Level 4b in English by the end of Key Stage 2. The programme involved morning workshops focused on writing and poetry delivered by trained teachers, professional authors and poets, and enrichment activities provided in a four-week summer school. Pupils meeting the eligibility criteria for the study, and due to transition from Year 6 to Year 7 in 2013, were recruited through 29 primary schools in proximity to the Discover Children’s Story Centre in Stratford, London in July and August 2013. The study involved 124 pupils from 29 local schools, of whom 76 were randomly selected to attend the summer school  the remaining 48 formed a comparison group. The evaluation was funded by the Education Endowment Foundation as one of 23 projects focused on literacy catch-up at the primary-secondary transition. It was one of two summer school programmes funded, and one of three programmes with a particular focus on writing. The evaluation sought to compare the literacy skills of pupils who attended the summer school with similar pupils who did not attend the summer school. The indicative effect sizes detected were 0.24 in writing and 0.21 in reading. This can be envisaged as saying that pupils who participated in the project made approximately three additional months’ progress compared to similar pupils who did not participate. However, the effect sizes were not statistically significant, which means that the differences between the pupils who attended the summer school and those who did not could have been down to chance. The conclusions which can be drawn from this study are severely limited due to the small number of families who agreed to participate in the trial, and to subsequent problems with testing, detailed further below. The low pupil numbers also meant that it was not possible to conduct a separate analysis of the impact of the programme on students eligible for free school meals. Though the evaluation was primarily focused on measuring attainment, the observations which took place suggested that most children were engaged by and enjoyed the summer school. Staff were supportive and children were encouraged to think creatively about their writing. The interactive approach in poetry sessions in particular appeared to motivate pupils.

38296693,Torgerson (2014),2014,"Grammar for Writing is a literacy intervention that aims to improve writing skills of Year 6 pupils by providing contextualised grammar teaching. It encourages pupils to improve how their writing communicates with the reader by making connections between a linguistic feature and the effect it has on writing, rather than by focusing on grammatical inaccuracies. It can be delivered as both a universal and targeted intervention. In this evaluation, the programme was trialled as both a whole class and small group approach, with pupils expected to achieve between Level 3 and 4b at Key Stage 2. The intervention involved 15 guided writing sessions, delivered over four weeks, in June/July 2013, and involved 53 primary schools from four geographical regions across England. Teachers in intervention classes received three days of training in the Grammar for Writing approach. The overall effect size of the class-level intervention compared to the ‘business as usual’ control was small (+0.10, estimated two additional months’ progress) and statistically insignificant (i.e., may have occurred by chance). A larger effect was observed when children were taught in small groups (+0.24, estimated three additional months’ progress), although this is very similar to the difference in effect size between the small group intervention and the whole class approach. This suggests that the observed gains in writing outcomes are likely to be as a result of teaching pupils in small groups, rather than any intrinsic benefit of teaching Grammar for Writing. There is, therefore, little evidence that the intervention provided additional gains in writing outcomes. The study does demonstrate that small group teaching is an effective strategy to increase writing skills among pupils between Level 3c and 4b, which is reasonably consistent with the emerging evidence base for small group tuition.

In order to be randomised, schools were required to sign a memorandum of understanding, complete a school information and current practices survey, provide pupil details for NPD linkage, and identify the 12 target pupils. Once these had been completed, a York Trials Unit statistician, Elizabeth Coleman, used MinimPY (Saghaei and Saghaei, 2011), a dedicated computer program, to randomise schools to the intervention group or to the control group. Schools were randomised on a real-time basis in small batches when they had provided all relevant data to enable effective set-up of the tutoring programme. Naïve minimisation with base probability 1.0 was conducted, that is, 1:1 deterministic minimisation. Minimisation is a form of dynamic allocation which assigns, in this scenario, schools to one group or another based on an algorithm which maintains the best balance on the minimisation factors (listed below). This process is predictable in that the allocation of a school can be worked out if the characteristics of that school, plus the characteristics and allocation of all schools entered previously, is known; therefore, a random element can be introduced which means that schools are allocated to the group which would maintain the best balance with a certain (high but less than one) probability, or to the other group. This aids non-predictability, and therefore avoids possible subversion of the randomisation. However, a random element was not required here, and naïve minimisation was deemed to be sufficient as the allocations were conducted in batches, rather than prospectively one by one. Predictability was therefore not a concern and hence a random element was not required. Minimisation using school characteristics and demographic information was undertaken to ensure the groups were balanced.

Further, government attempts to raise attainment are often disappointing. The project described in this article aimed to engage schools in reform to change students' attainment and attitudes in schools across a whole district. The intervention, peer tutoring, has a good research pedigree in small-scale studies, but scaling it up to district-level implementation has not been rigorously evaluated. Over 2 years, 129 elementary schools in 1 Scottish district were randomly assigned to different interventions. The implementation was not perfect, but the results were positive with respect to cross-age tutoring, which had effect sizes of about 0.2. Despite limitations, the study demonstrates that it is possible to carry out a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a large scale working with districts and suggests that peer tutoring has promise when scaled up. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Originally developed by a Finnish University, the program underpinning the game can analyse performance and constantly adjust the difficulty of the game content to match the learner’s ability. The English version of GraphoGame Rime was developed to implement the ‘rhyme analogy’ research by educational neuroscientist Usha Goswami, based at the University of Cambridge. The intervention aimed to improve the reading ability of a group of pupils who were identified as having low literacy skills, as measured by the phonics screening check taken at the end of Year 1. The intervention was delivered by teachers and teaching assistants. Training, technical support and some delivery support was provided by researchers from the University of Cambridge. This study was an efficacy trial of the GraphoGame Rime intervention, carried out during one spring term with 398 Year 2 pupils in 15 primary schools in Cambridgeshire. It was a pupil-randomised controlled trial designed to determine the impact of the intervention on the pupils’ reading attainment and was conducted with two cohorts of pupils over two years. The primary outcome was the raw score on the New Group Reading Test, administered by NFER test administrators within a month of the intervention ending, and provided by GL Assessment. A process evaluation used case-study visits, telephone interviews and analysis of data on pupils’ usage of the game to capture the perceptions and experiences of participating teaching staff and pupils.

37133992,Yarrow (2001),2001,"Background. The structured system for peer assisted learning in writing named Paired Writing (Topping, 1995) incorporates both metacognitive prompting and scaffolding for the interactive process. Aim. This study sought to evaluate the relative contribution of these two components to student gain in quality of writing and attitudes to writing, while controlling for amount of writing practice and teacher effects. Sample. Participants were 28 ten- and eleven-year-old students forming a problematic mixed ability class. Methods. All received training in Paired Writing and its inherent metacognitive prompting. Students matched by gender and pre-test writing scores were assigned randomly to Interaction or No Interaction conditions. In the Interaction condition, the more able writers became 'tutors' for the less able. In the No Interaction condition, the more able writers acted as controls for the tutors and the less able as controls for the tutees. Over six weeks, the paired writers produced five pieces of personal writing collaboratively, while children in the No Interaction condition did so alone. Results. On pre- and post-project analyses of the quality of individual writing, all groups showed statistically significant improvements in writing. However, the pre-post gains of the children who wrote interactively were significantly greater than those of the lone writers. There was some evidence that the paired writers also had more positive self-esteem as writers. Conclusion. The operation and durability of the Paired Writing system are discussed.",NA,NA,,"Journal, Article",,['Journal article'],NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'Scotland']",,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,The project was implemented with a mixed ability class of 10-11 year-olds in a medium sized primary school with a catchment area of overall average socio-economic status,,High ecological validity,NA,"This was an action research project in a school, the regular teaching staff delivering the intervention to a pre-existing natural grouping of children in one class",,"['10', '11']",NA,NA,,1,NA,,1,NA,,1,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,1,"['Page 8:\n[¬s]""The 28 children in the class comprised 16 girls and 12 boys.
