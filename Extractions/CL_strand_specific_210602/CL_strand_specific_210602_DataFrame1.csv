The study involved forty-one 11th grade students from two science classes with the same teacher. To determine students' misconceptions concerning electrochemistry, the Electrochemistry Concept Test consisting of 8 open-ended and 12 multiple-choice questions was used as a pre-test and some students were interviewed. According to the results, twenty-four misconceptions (six of them initially identified) about electrochemistry were identified. The classrooms were randomly assigned to a control group (traditional instruction, 21 students) and an experimental group (cooperative learning based on a constructivist approach, 20 students). After instruction, the same test was administered to both groups as a post-test. The results from the t-test indicated that the students who were trained using cooperative learning instruction had significantly higher scores in terms of achievement than those taught by the traditional approach.

47269762,Aguirre (1997) CL,1997,"Introduction. For a computer-based instruction to be effective in a cooperative learning situation teachers must learn to recognize the structure of the cooperative environment (Rysavy and Sales, 1990). Bowman (1984) noted that if education is a process for living, then schools must provide explicit opportunities for students to learn through interdependent roles and relationships involving significant others. Robert Slavin (1983), a major proponent of cooperative learning, advocated the practice of cooperative learning in order to redress the inconsistency between the obvious importance of cooperation to adult success and the schools' competitive and individualistic academic system. Purpose of the study. The purpose of the proposed study is to compare the effects of cooperative, competitive and individual computer-assisted instruction on the achievement of fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students. The following hypothesis is  H$\sb {o}$  There is no statistically significant difference between the achievement of middle grade students in a cooperative. competitive, and individual computer-assisted instruction. Research design and methodology. The proposed study will utilize a causal-comparative method. This type of research method is also called ex-post facto because causes are studied after they presumably have exerted their effect on another variable (Borg and Gall, 1989). The independent variable is the method of learning  cooperative model, competitive model, and individual model. The dependent variable is the achievement. A variation on this design will be that the three groups under study will have received different treatments. Each group, the competitive group, the individual group, and the cooperative group, have been pretested and post tested after having used a computer-assisted program. Archival data will form the basis for analysis. Significance of study. This study will make contribution to the research on cooperative learning. As currently used, the computer tends to increase the isolation and alienation of students. Some authors believe that promoting effective instructional use of computers without the isolation and alienation of students is a major task of those promoting the use of computers in schools (Johnson, Johnson, and Stance, 1985). Research in these areas should help educators realize the importance of integrating the curriculum with a cooperative computer-assisted environment.",['Collaborative learning'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,Low ecological validity,NA,The treatment did take place during regular school hours and with class teachers.

Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to determine if the application of STAD in the upper secondary social studies class would improve academic achievement and student attitude towards social studies class. The 47 twelfth-grade students in two advanced progress American Government classes were from a southern Mississippi public school. Each class received instruction from one of two teaching methods. The comparison group received instruction through traditional methods which utilized a lecture, textbook, worksheet and discussion format. The treatment group received instruction from a method which applied the Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD) cooperative learning technique. Both groups covered identical content and were administered the same tests. Attitude measures were obtained after the study through the application of the Estes Attitude Scale. Academic achievement was measured both prior to and after the study. The pretest and posttest were developed by the primary investigator and the classroom teacher with the aid of a panel of experts. Qualitative measures in the form of student and teacher surveys were administered after the completion of the study. ANCOVA and ANOVA statistical procedures were used to discern the findings of the study. The results of these tests demonstrated that the application of STAD in the upper secondary social studies classroom exhibited no statistically significant difference in academic achievement or student attitude towards social studies class. The qualitative dimension of the study, in the form of student and teacher surveys, suggests that the application of cooperative learning makes learning easier and more enjoyable for the student and is an easy technique to implement in the classroom, particularly in a block scheduled timetable.

43099584,Artzt (1983),1983,"Research shows that the teacher-centered method of instruction is the most prevalent form of teaching, and in general, students find mathematics classes boring and teachers find motivating students to learn mathematics their most difficult problem. Studies have supported the effectiveness of methods that use within-class grouping of students where ingroup cooperation is stimulated by intergroup competition. The Student Team method is such a technique (developed and used by the author), and unlike the other methods, has an uncomplicated structure and has been used in high school mathematics classes. This study describes the comparative effects of the Student Team method and the traditional teacher-centered method upon student achievement, attitude, and social interaction in high school mathematics courses. Subjects were 342 ninth, tenth, and eleventh graders in fourteen mathematics classes from three schools. Each of five teachers taught one or two experimental classes and one or two control classes for twenty weeks. Treatments for gathering data were  achievement tests, attitude questionnaires, sociometric questionnaires, teacher records, behavioral observations, and student and teacher interviews. A process description is given of one experimental class, observed and evaluated in greater depth than the other classes. Results indicated that the experimental students had significantly fewer missed homework assignments than did the control students (p < .0005). Behavioral observations showed that in the experimental classes there was significantly more student participation than in the control classes (p < .0005), and the experimental students received significantly more individualized help from their teachers than did the control students (p < .005). For academic achievement, mutual concern, and peer support for academic achievement benefits were related to different teacher implementations of the method. For race relations, attitude toward mathematics, and attitude toward the specific mathematics class results were mixed and not indicative of any relationships. Information was gained regarding teachers and students most likely to benefit from using the method, and effective ways to arrange teams. Suggestions were made for changes in the reward structure and methods of teacher training.

As expected, girls in the individual training condition improved significantly less than both girls in the cooperative condition and boys in the individual condition. In contrast, boys in the cooperative training condition did not differ significantly from either boys in the individual training condition or girls in the cooperative training condition.

It is believed among UAE educators that the main reason is the way science that has been taught in its schools. A solution to this problem depends on finding effective teaching methods, which maintain student achievement, improve students' attitude and provide opportunities to develop essential scientific skills.

43099479,Barbato (2000),2000,"This study compared the effects of traditional and cooperative methods of teaching on the mathematical achievement, attitudes, and course enrollment plans of 10th-grade students. Further, an attempt was made to ascertain whether mathematics achievement test scores, attitude toward mathematics, and plans for enrollment in mathematics courses differed for gender. Two hundred eight subjects from a suburban high school participated in the study. Approximately half were assigned to a mathematics course taught using traditional lecture, including a question-and-answer period and individualized assignments. The same instructor taught the other half using a cooperative learning method. This involved engaging students in interactive groups to discuss ideas, test conjectures, and solve problems. All classes were heterogeneously grouped for ability and mathematical achievement. Students completed a pretest and posttest measure of mathematical achievement using the New York State Integrated Math Test for Course I and II, respectively. Attitudes toward mathematics as a subject were measured at the beginning and end of the course using The Motivational Survey. At the beginning and at the end of the course, students identified the math courses they planned to take in their junior and senior years. The analysis of posttest data suggested that the class taught cooperatively had significantly higher mathematics achievement and showed more positive attitudes toward mathematics than the traditional group. There were no gender differences for mathematics achievements. Males did score higher than females for two subscales on The Motivational Survey, extrinsic motivation and self-efficacy motivation. No significant difference between males and females existed for intrinsic motivation. Regarding plans to enroll in advanced mathematics courses, a chi-square analysis of the pretest data revealed significant differences. More males than females planned to enroll in one of the highest level courses offered to junior and senior students. However, on the posttest no significant differences were found for gender. This was due to the shift in enrollment plans among females in the cooperative group. On the posttest, females in the cooperative group indicated a desire to enroll in higher level courses compared to their pretest selections.

Also analyzed were students' interaction in small groups and the structure of those groups. Sixty-six second-grade students in solo, pair, or triad treatment conditions were given a pretest and equivalent-form posttest. The computer task concerned cardinal and intermediate directions, which students applied in a computer tictactoe game. Interaction among the students was recorded by audiotape and observer notes. The coding protocol contained the four major categories  giving help, receiving no explanations, receiving explanations, and procedural assistance. Verbatim records of twenty-five randomly chosen students were coded, tallied, and analyzed. For students in pairs or triads (n = 55), group structure was analyzed for cooperation, competition, dominance, ""odd-man out"" phenomenon, and how the group developed over time. Students made significant gains in their social studies knowledge. Analysis of covariance, with the pretest as the covariate, showed no significant relationship between achievement and group size  achievement and sex  or achievement and ability. For triads, but not for pairs, students in mixed-ability groups had significantly greater gains in achievement than students in uniform-ability groups  this is consistent with prior research. Procedural help was the most frequent type of student interaction. There was no significant relationship between achievement and any of the four major categories of interaction. This is in contrast to the work of Webb (1982a, 1982b, 1982c, 1983, 1985). Because these students were much younger, they probably could not generate effective explanations. Of the twenty-two groups, sixteen were characterized by cooperation and three by competition. Neither ability nor sex was related to cooperation. Ability had no bearing on competition, but boys were more likely to compete. Cooperative interaction was least at the beginning of the session, increased during the middle, and slightly decreased at the end of the computer session.

Eighty sixth‐grade students and one life science teacher at an urban middle school participated in this study. Qualitative analysis of videotapes and interviews makes clear that group discussions rarely moved beyond observational or procedural matters, that students of high status (perceived academic ability and popularity) had greater access to their groups' materials and discourse, and that students made few connections among the contexts of school, science, and everyday life. Quantitative analyses of participation during groupwork and performance on unit tests show that high‐status students had significantly higher rates of on‐task talk than their middle‐ or low‐status counterparts, and that those students who talked more learned more as well. Thus, although groupwork should not be summarily dismissed as an instructional strategy, group tasks and implementation must be further refined to adequately address the dual goals of excellence and equity  Students need greater guidance in how to talk and do science, and teachers, greater assistance in eliminating differences in student participation and achievement.

Key components of the programme include  an emphasis on collaborative (or co- operative) learning  a requirement that participating teachers follow a consistent ‘cycle of instruction’  and the use of formative assessment in every lesson. Pupil progress is reviewed every eight weeks, with results used as the basis for re-grouping the class. The programme was designed by the charity Success for All and had been adapted from an existing programme available in the United States called Reading Edge. This project sought to assess the impact of Quest on Year 7 pupils’ reading comprehension and was supplemented by a process evaluation that assessed programme implementation. Six schools followed the programme, and a further 13 participated in the evaluation. All participating teachers received two days training and extensive resources to be used as part of the approach, including lesson plans, graded texts and ‘digitexts’ (interactive texts). The programme was designed to be delivered in daily 60-minute lessons by all Year 7 English teachers, and run over the full school year.

The hypotheses which the study investigated were as follows  (1) The cooperative-mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization is significantly more effective than the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization in increasing the mathematical achievement of urban second-grade pupils with respect to selected numerical concepts and computational skills. (2) The cooperative mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization is significantly more effective than the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization in increasing the self-esteem of urban second-grade pupils. (3) The correlation between self-esteem and mathematical achievement of urban second-grade pupils is high and positive. The target population for this study was urban second-grade pupils attending schools in the Middle Atlantic Region of the United States. Analyses of covariance with a nested design were utilized to ascertain the effects of classroom organization on mathematical achievement and self-esteem at the.05 level. Three factors were used in this nested design  methods, classes/teachers nested under methods and ability. A Pearson Product-Moment Correlation was employed to determine if there was a relationship between mathematical achievement and self-esteem. The results of the analyses permitted one to conclude that the cooperative-mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization was superior to the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization. A significant interaction effect was also found. It was further revealed that there is a significant correlation between mathematical achievement and self-esteem. The overall superiority of the cooperative-mastery learning/STAD form of classroom organization over the competitive-mastery learning form of classroom organization was sufficient to indicate that the act of combining cooperative learning procedures with mastery learning procedures would result in enhancing mathematical performance and self-esteem of urban pupils.","['Collaborative learning', 'Mastery learning']",NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 16:\n[¬s]""second-\ngrade pupils[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,intervention can be implemented in school with teacher training,,"['7', '8']","['Page 16:\n[¬s]""second-\ngrade[¬e]""', 'Page 16:\n[¬s]""second-\ngrade[¬e]""']",NA,,4,"['Page 51:\n[¬s]""four schools[¬e]""', 'Page 54:\n[¬s]""Each school had\nan experimental and a control group class.[¬e]""']",,,4,"['Page 51:\n[¬s]""four schools[¬e]""', 'Page 54:\n[¬s]""Each school had\nan experimental and a control group class.[¬e]""']",,4,"['Page 48:\n[¬s]""four schools[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,4,"['Page 75:\n[¬s]""Class""\n""1""\n""3""\n""5""\n""7[¬e]""']",,4,,"['Page 77:\n[¬s]""Class""\n""2""\n""4""\n""6""\n""8[¬e]""']",8,"['Page 51:\n[¬s]""eight classes[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],"['Page 15:\n[¬s]""two forms of class\xad\nroom organization, cooperative-mastery learning (STAD),\nand competitive-mastery learning[¬e]""']",NA,,"Non-random, not matched prior to treatment","['Page 51:\n[¬s]""Fourteen pupils were randomly selected from each of\nthe eight classes in the four schools, making a total of\none hundred and twelve subjects in the sample.[¬e]""']","assignment to experimental groups was non-random as pre-existing classes - however, random samples of pupils were selected for the purpose of analysis (N=112) stratified by mathematics score",,Class,NA,existing intact classes selected to participate,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 51:\n[¬s]""Fourteen pupils were randomly selected from each of\nthe eight classes in the four schools, making a total of\none hundred and twelve subjects in the sample.[¬e]""', 'Page 54:\n[¬s]""design used intact groups which were randomly assigned\nto experimental and control treatments.

A comparison of standardized test scores in matched BCIRC (N = 3) and comparison (N = 4) schools generally supported these expectations.

38296678,Crawford (2014),2014,"The Literacy Intervention Toolkit (LIT) programme aims to improve the reading ability of children in Year 7 who scored below Level 4 at the end of primary school using a method known as reciprocal teaching. Reciprocal teaching methods encourage children to ‘become the teacher’. They are taught how to apply four comprehension strategies  summarising, clarifying, questioning, and predicting. These strategies enable children to check that they understand the content of the material they are reading and can make inferences based on what they have read. The LIT programme is tightly structured, providing training to staff as well as a set of detailed lesson plans on the use of reciprocal teaching to deliver basic instruction in literacy. However, the method of delivery is not particularly prescriptive. It can be used to teach whole classes or small groups, can be delivered by teachers or teaching assistants, and can be offered in addition to or instead of regular English classes. In this evaluation, children typically received 3–4 hours of LIT tuition per week for eight months, mostly delivered in small groups. The programme was devised by the Hackney Learning Trust, who delivered the training sessions for staff and developed a detailed set of lesson plans for them to follow. The primary outcome was reading ability as assessed by scores on the Access Reading Test (ART). The LIT programme was tested using a randomized control trial (RCT). 41 schools were recruited, with 22 schools randomly allocated to a treatment group and 19 schools to a control group.","['Reading comprehension strategies', 'Collaborative learning', 'Metacognition and self-regulation']",NA,,Report,['Technical report'],,NA,NA,,"['UK (Select all that apply)', 'England']",,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['12', '11']",NA,NA,,22,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""22 schools[¬e]""']",,,19,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""19 schools t[¬e]""']",,41,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]"" 41 schools were recruited[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,['not_provided'],All Y7 classes in all 41 schools,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 11:\n[¬s]""randomized controlled trial""\n""There was a single treatment arm, with half of the 41 recruited schools randomly allocated to the treatment group and half to the control group.""\n"" In treatment schools, a subset of Year 7 pupils was selected to participate in the intervention.

Johnson and Aronson stated that positive interdependence leads to superior performance on objective and subjective measures. Teachers continually look for effective methodologies to help students improve their mathematics achievement. Previous studies have demonstrated that the Jigsaw technique of cooperative instruction has improved student achievement in social studies, reading, and language arts. This technique of dividing responsibilities for understanding a portion of a task then pooling resources to comprehend the larger body of information has been successful with other areas of the curriculum.

The study reported in this paper investigated the effect of various teaching methods on Israeli students' achievements, acquiring laboratory skills, and the dimensions of learning activities. The Cell topic was taught to an experimental group using the Jigsaw method and cooperative learning strategies and to a control group using the customary frontal method. Research instruments included the achievement test on the cell topic and observations before and during the learning activity. Results indicate that students who studied by the Jigsaw method had higher achievement in the test than students in the control group and high achievements were obtained with students with medium academic ability.

The population of the study consisted of third, fourth, and fifth grade students enrolled in regular classrooms and in Chapter 1 Reading in two Midwestern school corporations. There were 266 students in the study. The experimental group received instruction and modeling in reciprocal teaching comprehension monitoring strategy by the Chapter 1 teachers. The control group did not receive instruction and modeling of the strategy. The Iowa Test of Basic Skills, Form G (Levels 9, 10, 11), was administered as the pretest and posttest. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate differences between the experimental group and the control group which may have resulted from the treatment effect. The hypotheses tested the reading comprehension achievement gain, science achievement gain, and social science achievement gain. Findings. (1) It was found that there were significant differences in third, fourth, and fifth grade students in science achievement gain when they had instruction and modeling of reciprocal teaching. (2) It was found that there were significant differences in third grade students in reading comprehension achievement and social science achievement when they had instruction and modeling of reciprocal teaching.

47269802,Giannitti (1988) CL,1988,"The purpose of this investigation was to analyze the relationship between sociological preferences and instructional grouping patterns as those variables independently and/or interactively affected achievement in social studies and attitudes toward instructional grouping techniques. This research compared achievement and attitudes of students with a preference for learning alone or learning-with-peers under matched and mismatched conditions, and achievement and attitudes of students with no preference for either of those grouping patterns under conditions of learning alone and learning-with-peers. The sample population was comprised of 104 middle school students (grades six, seven, eight) from two separate schools in Nassau County, New York. The Learning Style Inventory (LSI  Dunn, Dunn, & Price, 1985) was administered to each student to ascertain sociological learning style preference. The only significant effect on achievement was the interaction between Preference and Instructional Grouping Patterns (.001). Specifically, learning alone and learning-with-peers preferents performed significantly better in the treatment that was congruent with their sociological preferences, and no-preferenced subjects performed significantly better in the learning-alone treatment. Data on attitudes revealed significant effects for Sociological Preference (.05), and the interaction between Preference and Instructional Grouping Patterns (.05). Specifically, learning alone and learning-with-peers preferents demonstrated more positive attitudes toward the instructional treatment that was congruent with their sociological preferences, and no-preferenced subjects demonstrated more positive attitudes toward the learning-alone treatment.

43099481,Glassman (1989),1989,"During the past two decades, cooperative learning has gained increased attention as a means to raise students' achievement, improve intergroup relations and enhance youngsters' attitudes. This study examined the effects of cooperative learning in mathematics, writing and reading as implemented in third, fourth and fifth grade classes. Few studies have attempted to investigate cooperative learning interventions when implemented in more than two subject areas simultaneously. The study sought to determine whether cooperative learning would improve achievement, self-esteem, attitudes and gender and race relations for various student subgroups. A quasi-experimental design with random assignment of teachers to experimental and control groups was employed. The sample included 441 students in two suburban intermediate schools on Long Island. The Iowa Tests of Basic Skills were used as pre- and posttests for achievement. To assess attitudes, the Coopersmith Self-esteem Inventory, a Favored Academic Subjects Survey and a Friendship Choice Inventory were involved. Additionally, pretests and posttests for writing were included. The method of statistical analysis conducted was an analysis of covariance. Relative to achievement, a statistically significant difference was revealed favoring the treatment group in writing, specifically in ideas in writing. Additionally, statistically significant differences were found favoring the cooperative learning group with respect to attitudes toward reading and perceived abilities in reading. Girls in the treatment group evidenced gains in mathematics and boys in the experimental group revealed enhanced social self-concept. In other areas under investigation, no significant differences were identified. It was surprising that a greater number of significant differences favoring the cooperative learning treatment group did not emerge as outcomes. However, given the character of the district in the study with its focus upon staff development, curriculum innovations and data analysis, the results may be understood in a context that extends beyond the treatment. Further research is recommended for cooperative learning as applied to  longitudinal studies, multiple disciplines, state mandates, mentors, cooperative schools and strategies for educators.

In the present study, the effectiveness of an instructional model, Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD), designed to foster development in each of these areas, was examined. Adding a peer support component to SRSD instruction to facilitate maintenance and generalization was also examined. Struggling, third grade writers, the majority of whom were minority students attending schools that served primarily low-income families, received SRSD instruction focused primarily on learning writing strategies and knowledge for planning and composing stories and persuasive essays. These students wrote longer, more complete, and qualitatively better papers for both of these genres than peers in the comparison condition (Writers’ Workshop). These effects were maintained over time for story writing and generalized to a third uninstructed genre, informative writing. SRSD instruction boosted students’ knowledge about writing as well. The peer support component augmented SRSD instruction by increasing students’ knowledge of planning and enhancing generalization to informative and narrative writing.

Subjects were 32, sixth grade students assigned to discussion groups with or without instruction in question generation  and individuals with or without with instruction in question generation. Students in each three phases of the study read a different literary text, generated questions, and wrote essays. Only the instructional groups received instruction in the generation of inferential questions. The questions generated by all four groups were used for either group discussion or required independent written answers. An assessment was made to determine the effectiveness of question instruction as compared to those who received no instruction  group discussion's influence on the individual compared to individuals responding independently to the questions  and whether an ability to answer higher ordered questions would subsume an ability to answer lower level questions. The findings indicated  (1) Discussion groups evidenced better comprehension than individuals. When all conditions were compared, the groups did better than individuals who did not receive instruction. Organization of group versus individual was significant for comprehension. Instruction in question generation was not. (2) Students who received instruction produced significantly more inferential and fewer literal and total questions. (3) There was no relationship between the number and type of questions generated and comprehension. (4) Students who wrote more inferential questions, discussion groups, and no-discussion individuals who received instruction in question generation produced a greater number of interpretive responses in their essays. (5) Question types ranged taxonomically and students responded to them in kind. Students were able to answer questions on and below their ability level but could not succeed with higher level questions. It was concluded that comprehension could be facilitated through collaborative learning and the strategy of reader generated questions.

Thirty-six students aged ten learned LOGO individually or in groups of two or three for one session, had a practice session, then were required to produce a graphic in LOGO for the experimental session. No differences were found between individuals and groups, in terms of productivity. Group interaction (as measured by the Bales Interaction Process Analysis [1], was found to be similar in two and three person groups. However, significant (p < .05) differences were observed among male, female, and mixed groups. The direction of these differences were as follows  males displayed more solidarity than females or mixed groups, the female group members were much more likely to express agreement with their peers than were members of the males group.

LTSS challenges students’ thinking, develops their metacognitive skills, and encourages cooperative learning. Let’s Think Forum (a registered charity led by a group of academics, teachers, and consultants) created LTSS by adapting a programme called Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE). Let’s Think Forum’s adaptations to CASE included reducing the number of lessons from 30 to 19, reducing the number of scientific principles that are taught, rewriting lesson plans, and providing additional resources like PowerPoint slides and video tutorials. In this trial, Let’s Think Forum provided one day of training and three support sessions per year to the science teachers who would be teaching LTSS. These teachers then delivered the lessons to a cohort of Year 7 students instead of their usual science lessons. LTSS was delivered over two years, so this cohort of pupils continued to receive the programme in Year 8. LTSS was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial with over 8000 students in 53 schools. Schools were randomly allocated to deliver either the programme or their ‘business as usual’ science teaching. It should be considered an effectiveness trial, as it aimed to test a scalable intervention under realistic conditions in a large number of schools. The primary outcome measure was an age-appropriate science test based on a Key Stage 3 SATs paper, and the secondary measures were English and maths tests provided by GL Assessment. The process evaluation consisted of lesson observations, surveys, and interviews with staff, and surveys and focus groups with students.

While no differences were found between the two conditions for physics achievement gains, the results revealed differences in students' experience of the three basic needs (autonomy, competence, and social relatedness as posited by self-determination theory of learning), in self-reported cognitive activation, and in degree of intrinsic motivation. Path analyses showed that the basic needs partially mediated the effects of method of instruction on cognitive activation and intrinsic motivation. Increases in feelings of competence with cooperative learning were associated with better performance in physics. When controlling for competence, however, direct instruction had a facilitating effect on physics performance. Four aspects of students' personal learning characteristics (previous knowledge, academic self-concept in physics, academic goal orientation, uncertainty orientation) were assessed.

The relative contributions of attitude toward instruction as well as three process variables, response accuracy, level of option selection, and time spent viewing instruction were examined. Group characteristics taken into account which may impact achievement and attitudinal outcomes included  type of group, preparation for group work, and group composition. In addition, achievement results of high, middle, and low ability learners were analyzed by instructional condition  individual versus cooperative group. The types of cognitive learning levels which are most appropriate for individual versus group learners was also explored. Three categories of learning according to Gagne's theory of learning outcomes were used in this study  verbal information, defined concept, and rules. Subjects were 102 volunteers enrolled in an eighth grade Earth Science course. These subjects were stratified by ability according to previously measured reading achievement scores. Subjects were also randomly assigned to either the individual learning or cooperative group learning condition. Seventeen triads, each having a high, middle, and low ability subject were formed. Results indicated that subjects in the two instructional conditions, individual and cooperative group, learned verbal information, concepts, and rules with the same level of proficiency. While high and middle ability subjects in the individual condition as compared to high and middle ability subjects in the cooperative group condition, scored significantly higher on rule learning, low ability subjects in the cooperative group condition as compared to low ability subjects in the individual condition scored significantly higher on rule learning. In relation to the process variables under study, middle and low ability subjects in the cooperative group condition scored significantly higher on response accuracy than middle and low ability subjects in the individual condition. In addition, response accuracy and number of options selected showed significant correlation to achievement for individual learners on some posttests.

Proactive classroom management, interactive teaching, and cooperative learning methods were included. Low achievers in experimental classrooms showed more favorable attitudes toward math, more bonding to school, greater expectations for continuing schooling, and less serious misbehavior as measured by suspensions and expulsions from school than did their low-achieving control counterparts at the end of one academic year. Among low achievers, significant effects of the teaching practices were not found for California Achievement Test scores or for self-reported delinquency or drug use. The results suggest that interventions in mainstream classrooms can promote school attachment and deter misbehavior among low-achieving students.

43099714,Hernandez (1997),1997,"Recently, an emphasis has been placed on teaching mathematics in cooperative learning settings and through a problem solving approach (NCTM, 1989). Although numerous research studies have been conducted on the effects of cooperative learning on mathematics achievement, attitudes, and self-efficacy, no study was found that addresses the use of cooperative learning while teaching mathematical problem solving and heuristic strategies and its effect on metacognition. The purpose of this study was to assess seventh and eighth grade male and female students' metacognition, self-efficacy, attitudes toward mathematics, and achievement after participating in a two-week course on problem solving. Problem solving is an important area of inquiry, as previous research indicates that females demonstrate lower performance in solving non-routine problems. This experimental study used a pretest-posttest control-group design in which students were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups or a control group during a summer enrichment program offered to talented students in a southern state. All three groups received instruction in probability and statistics through a mathematical problem solving approach using heuristic strategies. The two experimental groups were taught through cooperative learning methods. In the first experimental group, students worked in mixed-gender groups and, in the second one, in single-gender groups. The control group was taught using whole-group instruction in which competition and individual work was stressed. Students' achievement in probability and statistics, self-efficacy, and attitudes toward mathematics was assessed at the beginning and end of instruction. Data from the assessment of these three variables were analyzed using a multiple analysis of covariance and a follow-up discriminant function analysis. Students' metacognitive episodes were assessed using content analysis procedures. Although the literature suggests that cooperative learning settings, particularly single-gender groups, are more beneficial for females, no statistical differences in achievement or self-efficacy were found among the groups. Statistically significant differences in attitudes toward mathematics were found favoring students in the whole group instruction, competitive setting. Also, the highest achieving male and female students exhibited more metacognitive episodes in the competitive setting than students in the other groups. Lower achieving male and female students, however, exhibited fewer metacognitive episodes in this type of setting.",['Collaborative learning'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Other educational setting (please specify)'],"['Page 24:\n[¬s]"" u n iv e rsity -b a se d su m m e r e n ric h m e n t p r o g ra [¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['12', '13', '14']",NA,NA,,≥1,"['Page 25:\n[¬s]""Three classes[¬e]""']",,,≥1,"['Page 25:\n[¬s]""Three classes[¬e]""']",,≥1,"['Page 25:\n[¬s]""Three classes[¬e]""']",,['not_provided'],Not provided - assumed to be one school minimum,NA,2,"['Page 26:\n[¬s]""One experimental group had mixed-\ngender groups, and the other one had separate-gender groups[¬e]""']",,1,,"['Page 26:\n[¬s]""The control group was\ntaught the same content using whole class instruction.[¬e]""']",3,"['Page 25:\n[¬s]""Three classes of\nsixteen students (eight girls, eight boys per class) enrolled the class on problem\nsolving in probability and statistics.[¬e]""', 'Page 26:\n[¬s]""All three groups were taught heuristic strategies to\nsolve problems in probability and statistics.[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],"['Page 4:\n[¬s]""T h e tw o e x p e rim e n ta l g ro u p s w e r e t a u g h t th ro u g h c o o p e ra tiv e le a r n in g m e th o d s .

43099539,Hitchcock (2011),2011,"Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR) is a set of instructional strategies designed to improve the reading comprehension of students with diverse abilities (Klingner and Vaughn 1996). Teachers implement CSR at the classroom level using scaffolded instruction to guide students in the independent use of four comprehension strategies  students apply the strategies to informational text while working in small cooperative learning groups. The current study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining the effect of CSR on student reading comprehension. Within each participating linguistically diverse school, grade 5 social studies classrooms were randomly assigned to either the CSR condition (using CSR when delivering social studies curricula) or to the control condition (a business-as-usual condition). The implementation period was one school year. This study focused on the following confirmatory research question  In linguistically diverse schools, do grade 5 students in CSR classrooms have higher average reading comprehension posttest scores on the Group Reading Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation (GRADE) than students in control classrooms? In addition, the study examined three exploratory research questions about CSR's effect on two subgroups of students  (1) Do grade 5 former and current English language learner (FC-ELL) students in CSR classrooms have higher average reading comprehension posttest scores on the GRADE than FC-ELL students in control classrooms?  (2) Do grade 5 non-ELL students in CSR classrooms have higher average reading comprehension posttest scores on the GRADE than non-ELL students in control classrooms?  and (3) Does CSR have a differential impact on GRADE reading comprehension posttest scores for grade 5 FC-ELL and non-ELL students? The intent of these exploratory analyses was to examine whether there is an effect for each subgroup separately, as well as whether there is a differential effect between the subgroups. The primary finding of this study is that CSR did not have a statistically significant impact on student reading comprehension. Nine sensitivity analyses--including alternative statistical approaches, an alternative approach for handling missing data, and different sample specifications--showed that the findings were robust to different analytic approaches. Three exploratory analyses were also conducted to examine the effects of CSR on FC-ELL and non-ELL students. Statistically significant effects on student reading comprehension were not identified for either subgroup, and no statistically significant differential impacts were identified. It is often the case that RCTs, because of their greater rigor, do not support the findings of prior quasi-experiments (Glazerman, Levy, and Myers 2002, 2003). With all other design features held constant, randomization yields stronger evidence about program impacts than do quasi-experiments (Boruch 1997  Shadish, Cook, and Campbell 2002). The current investigation evaluated the impact of CSR in an effectiveness trial designed to approximate a district's implementation of CSR. Data on the fidelity of implementation suggest that professional development was generally delivered according to plan. Data on teacher fidelity of CSR implementation showed that 78.8 percent of teachers reported using CSR two or more times a week, as instructed. However, the single observation conducted for each classroom found that 21.6 percent of CSR teachers were using all five core teacher strategies, which the study defined as full procedural fidelity  56.8 percent of teachers were observed using three or fewer strategies.

43099442,Ho (2007),2007,"This paper reports on the results of an action research to explore the effectiveness of using cooperative learning strategies on students' academic achievement, their understanding of physics concepts and their motivation to learn in the physics classroom. The study involved a secondary four express physics class of 41 students in a neighbourhood school. Various cooperative learning structures were used to teach the topics on ""Current Electricity' and ""D.C. Circuits' over a period of about 8 weeks. During this period, teacher-crafted pre- and post-intervention tests were administered to the class. A questionnaire survey was used to examine students' motivation to learn and perceptions of their learning experiences before and after the treattnent period. A class using traditional method of teaching was also involved in the study as a control. The effects of using cooperative learning on students' academic achievement and their motivation to learn were examined through the analysis of the results of the pre- and post-tests and students' perception surveys, while the extent of using cooperative learning on helping students achieve a better understanding of physics concepts was examined through the qualitative analysis of the students' journals.

The teachers and students were paired and arbitrarily assigned to either a treatment group or comparison group. This six-week study used both quantitative and qualitative data collection. The quantitative data collection consisted of the administration of a pre-sociogram and posttest to measure academic achievement. The qualitative data collection consisted of administration of a pretest and postsociogram, administrator, teacher, and student interviews, participant observation, and a cooperative learning attitudinal survey administered only to the treatment group to determine cross-race relationships. The achievement test was developed by the researcher and Multiple Linear Regression was used to test the hypotheses of the study. More specifically the ANCOVA was used under the framework of Multiple Linear Regression. This study revealed that cooperative learning had an effect only on the interaction between academic ability groupings and academic achievement, while revealing no significant interaction between gender, race relationships and methodology and academic achievement. The qualitative data analysis showed that the major effects of the cooperative learning on the secondary students were affective rather than cognitive.

An external control group was used. Dependent variables included mathematics achievement on the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) and four student attitude scales. Results indicated that Team Competition students improved significantly more on the SAT, attached more importance to game success, and reported a higher level of peer group interest and peer pressure to do well at the game than did Individual Competition students. Group Practice students did not differ significantly in their performance on the SAT from Individual Practice students, but did attach less importance to game success than students who practiced individually. When compared to the external control group, Team Competition students (the standard TGT treatment) indicated significantly greater improvement on the SAT, reported a higher expectancy of success at the game, attached more importance to game success, reported more interest by peers in their performance, and were more satisfied with the game task. In conclusion, the team reward structure is more important than group practice sessions  in terms of expectancy value theory, team structure alters students' perceived probability of success without affecting the importance of that success.

43099330,Kosters (1990),1990,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether using cooperative learning in a traditional secondary social studies classroom would have a positive effect on student achievement and attitude. Many studies have evaluated various cooperative learning methods. Most of these have found statistically significant results for achievement and attitude. A review of the literature, however, revealed a need for information relating to the effects cooperative learning would have in the social studies on the secondary level. A pretest/posttest nonequivalent comparison group design was employed to address the problem statement and questions. The subjects for the study were students in required senior high school American history classes. After taking an achievement and attitude pretest the students in the experimental group received the cooperative learning strategy STAD (Students Teams Achievement Divisions) along with traditional instruction. Students in the control group, after taking the pretests, received only traditional instruction. At the conclusion of the study posttests were administered to both groups. The data from the covariates which were grade point average and student aptitude, and the pretests/posttests were analyzed and comparisons made between the experimental and control groups. The results of the study indicated that while the experimental group improved more than the control group academically, there was no statistically significant difference between posttests. Of the twelve subscales used to measure student attitude about cooperative learning and their peers, significant differences were found on only two. On an informal survey, students in the experimental group supported the positive results that previous research has found concerning attitude. The students wrote that they enjoyed working together, learned more, and got more done. These comments were also heard by the researcher as he observed the cooperative learning groups. The study revealed that positive results can be found in student achievement and attitude in a classroom that uses cooperative learning in conjunction with the traditional method of instruction.

The problem of this study was to explore the effects of cooperative and mastery learning methods, alone and in combination, on first and second grade students' learning and retention of basic economic concepts. A 2 X 2 (cooperative X mastery) factorial design compared the achievement of one hundred-twenty students who were individually randomly assigned (using grade level as a stratification variable) to one of four treatment conditions?instruction on basic economic concepts using (1) cooperative learning, (2) mastery learning, (3) cooperative-mastery learning, or (4) a control treatment (no cooperative or mastery learning). All subjects were administered a written pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test on their understanding of economic concepts. To further probe children's understanding of economic concepts, a randomly selected sub-sample of sixty- four students was interviewed using an oral pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test. Overall, the results support the superiority of the cooperative-mastery learning method over either method alone in promoting the acquisition and retention of economic concepts. Pretest data verified the initial equivalence of groups. The cooperative-mastery learning group outperformed (a) the control group on all post-tests and delayed post-tests and (b) the cooperative learning group on all post-tests and delayed post-tests except the written post-test. By delayed post-test on the oral measure, the cooperative-mastery learning group was also outperforming the mastery learning group. As further evidence of the superiority of the cooperative-mastery learning method, the mean score of the cooperative-mastery learning group was greater than the combined mean scores of the mastery and cooperative learning groups on the oral post-test and delayed post-test. The authors suggest that the cooperative-mastery learning method is in line with current early childhood practices and has the capacity for simultaneously boosting the conceptual development and language development of young children. This capacity is said to stem from the method's provision of (a) specific, positive feedback, (b) a social context for sustained effort and involvement in a topic, (c) child?child communication exchanges, and (d) adult?child communication exchanges.",['Collaborative learning'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Conference paper'],,NA,"Annual Meeting of the College and University Faculty Assembly, National Council for the Social Studies ",,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],"['Page 11:\n[¬s]""at two elementary schools[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 14:\n[¬s]""he artificial nature of these two groups constitutes a limitation\nof the present study, but it was necessary in order to isolate\nteacher-given corrective feedback (a key element of mastery\nlearning) and prevent the contamination of nonmastery-oriented\ntreatments.[¬e]""']",overall realistic although the designis described somehow articificial due to the restrictions of teachers (eg. providing feedback) due to reasons of avoidance of contamination.

Using quantitative and qualitative data analysis techniques, the researchers concluded that students working in peer collaborative groups developed more scientifically correct conceptions of photosynthesis than did students working alone. However, not all group‐generated views were internalized by group members when assessed individually. Based on qualitative data, a functional relationship exists between prior knowledge and concept development. Two types of peer interaction, consonant and dissonant, were identified as enhancing concept development. When peer group roles are not assigned, roles fluctuate depending on group members' expertise or perceived expertise displaying a bidirectional zone of proximal development. This zone allows for enhanced concept development. Based on the above conclusions, the researchers recommend that (1) peer collaboration be used to help students overcome scientific misconceptions  (2) peer collaborative tasks be designed to engage students in consonant and dissonant interactions  and (3) cognitive group roles, as opposed to traditionl managerial cooperative group roles, be used.",['Collaborative learning'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Secondary/High school'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""high school biology classes[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['16', '17']",NA,NA,,1,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Subjects for this study were selected from high school biology classes in a midwestern city.[¬e]""']",,,1,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Two biology classes with a total enrollment of 66 students were chosen as a pool for\nsubjects[¬e]""']",,2,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Students were randomly assigned into treatment or control groups[¬e]""']",NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Students were randomly assigned into treatment or control groups.[¬e]""']",NA,,Individual,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""randomly assigning\nstudents into collaborative triads or the control group with the same proportion of high, medi\xad\num, and low students in each group ([¬e]""']",NA,,['Individual RCT'],"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Students were randomly assigned into treatment or control groups.

The class means was used as the unit of analysis. SAS General Linear Model procedure's programs of ANOVA, MANOVA were used to test the nine null hypotheses included in this study. Conclusions. (1) TGT cooperative learning method was significantly more effective than the traditional teacher-centered method (TTC) in enhancing class's science achievement. (2) TGT method enhanced science achievement of the classes different abilities (high, average) more than TTC did. (3) Both TGT and TTC classes showed positive attitudes on their attitudes pre and post tests, but there was no significant difference between them either on the pretest nor the posttest. (4) There was no significant difference between TGT and TTC classes on mutual attraction and helpfulness. Recommendations. The results of this study imply that the use of TGT method in first grade science classes in Riyadh intermediate schools represents appropriate and effective pedagogy. Recommendations were made to replicate the study in rural schools, female schools, for different grade levels, and in different subject matter. Studies to analyze effect of variables like  TGT components, and classroom physical facilities were also recommended.",['Collaborative learning'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['Saudi Arabia'],,['Secondary/High school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 99:\n[¬s]"" classes were randomly selected among the first grade classes taught by the same teacher following the randomization method mentioned earlier.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['12', '13']",NA,NA,,7,"['Page 95:\n[¬s]""Seven intermediate schools were ra[¬e]""']",,,7,"['Page 95:\n[¬s]""Seven intermediate schools were randomly selected from\nall Riyadh boys\' intermediate schools t[¬e]""']",,7,"['Page 95:\n[¬s]""Seven intermediate schools were randomly selected from\nall Riyadh boys\' intermediate schools that had at least two\nfirst grade classes taught by one science teacher[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,7,"['Page 100:\n[¬s]""TTC TGT TGT TTC\nTTC TGT\nTTC)TGT\nTGT TTC TTC TGT !

Participants were third and sixth grade students (5 schools, 19 classrooms, N = 623 children). Within each grade level, classes were randomly assigned to work cooperatively or individually with the ILS. The duration of the study was approximately one academic year. Results showed that in both grade levels, students who used the system cooperatively outperformed their counterparts who used the system individually. The beneficial effects of the cooperative ILS were manifest on basic skills and higher cognitive processes. In addition, the analyses showed that within third grade, low achievers benefited from the cooperative ILS more than high achievers, whereas within sixth grade, the aptitude X treatment interaction on the post-treatment mean scores was not significant.

Reciprocal teaching is a method in which the teacher participates both as a leader and as respondent. Before the experiment began, the teachers were trained for a day in reciprocal teaching and introduced to principles of collaborative learning, such as the joint role of student and teacher in acquiring comprehension strategies, the role of teacher modeling, and the importance of allowing students to lead discussions. Participants were 63 experimental and 66 control students. After pretesting, the teachers in the experimental classes introduced collaborative learning, and four reading comprehension strategies. Twenty days of reciprocal teaching followed, with each teacher implementing new stages in the process at the same time. Control groups used traditional basal reading instruction. During a 5-day maintenance phase, subjects completed daily assessment measures, after which students in both groups completed summarization and questioning transfer measures as a posttest. Three of the teachers were more comfortable with reciprocal teaching than the others, although assistance from leaders helped all six groups receive the same quality of instruction. Results revealed a significant improvement in experimental students' accuracy with recall and interpretation of material they read independently.

38111403,Piercy (1997),1997,"The purpose of this study was to examine how one group of four classes of elementary students receiving multi-strategy instruction compared to one group of four classes of students receiving traditional instruction, as measured by a standardized measure of reading comprehension and a non-standardized performance assessment. Components of traditional instruction included  know-wonder-learn, question-answer relationship, retelling, story frames, and story maps. In addition to these, the three components in the multi-strategy approach in this study were reciprocal teaching, think-pair-share, and question/response cueing. The impact that the three component instructional approach had on reading comprehension was evaluated in a quasi-experimental study in which the reading performances of the 92 students in the treatment group were contrasted with the performances of the 93 students in the control group receiving traditional instruction. Students were heterogeneously grouped. To test the impact of multi-strategy instruction on reading comprehension, a two-way repeated ANOVA was computed using CTBS Fall to Spring and the treatment/control as the two independent variables. The dependent standardized measure incorporated to measure reading comprehension was the California Test of Basic Skills. The means and standard deviations for the total scores of the treatment and control groups were presented and found to be insignificant. It was concluded that the data analysis for the standardized scores for this study of reading comprehension did not favor the treatment or control group.

This paper reports a study designed to determine the effect of cooperative learning strategies on mathematics achievement of 7th graders. Based on school records indicating whether a student had participated in the cooperative learning strategies group or had received individualized/competitive instruction, 50 seventh-grade students were selected from an elementary school located in a low socioeconomic neighborhood in Chicago made up of all minority students. Scores on the mathematics portion of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills administered in the Spring of 1991 and 1992 were utilized to compare the mathematics achievement of the students in the two groups. T-tests performed on the pre-test and post-test data indicated that no differences existed in the groups prior to instruction, but that the cooperative learning groups performed significantly higher on the post-test. These findings confirmed results of similar studies. The paper concluded that cooperative group learning strategies are more effective in promoting mathematics achievement.

43099682,Slavin (1981),1981,"Cooperative learning methods, in which students work in small, heterogeneous learning teams to master academic materials, have been found in a series of studies to significantly improve student achievement, race relations, and other outcomes. However, one issue concerning these effects has not been resolved  do they occur equally for black and white students, or does learning cooperatively disproportionately benefit one race or the other? This study investigates treatment x race interactions in ten integrated middle school English classes. The sample consists of 230 students in grades six through eight, of whom 78 (33.9 percent) were black, the rest white. Four experimental classes (n = 84) studied language mechanics for twelve weeks using a cooperative learning method, while six classes (n = 146) studied the same curriculum materials on the same schedule but did not work in cooperative teams.

There is much support for using cooperative methods, since important instructional aspects, such as elaboration of new information, can easily be realized by methods like ‘jigsaw’.

Three conditions of instruction were compared  jigsaw, jigsaw with a supplementary questioning training and teacher‐guided instruction. Sample. Nine third grade classes from three schools with 208 students participated in the study. In each school, all the three instructional conditions were realized in three different classes. Method. All classes studied three units on geometry and one unit on astronomy using the assigned instructional method. Each learning unit comprised six lessons. For each unit, an achievement test was administered as pre‐test, post‐test and delayed test. Results. In the math units, no differences between the three conditions could be detected. In the astronomy unit, students benefited more from teacher‐guided instruction. Differential analyses revealed that ‘experts’ learned more than students in teacher‐guided instruction, whereas ‘novices’ were outperformed by the students in the control classes. Conclusions. Even third graders used the jigsaw method with satisfactory learning results. The modest impact of the questioning training and the low learning gains of the cooperative classes in the astronomy unit as well as high discrepancies between learning outcomes of experts and novices show that explicit instruction of explaining skills in combination with well‐structured material are key issues in using the jigsaw method with younger students.",['Collaborative learning'],NA,,"Journal, Article",['Journal article'],,NA,NA,,['Germany'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['8', '9']",NA,NA,,3,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""three schools""\n""In each school, all the three instructional conditions were realized[¬e]""']",,,3,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""three schools""\n""In each school, all the three instructional conditions were realized[¬e]""']",,3,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""three schools""\n""In each school, all the three instructional conditions were realized[¬e]""']",,NA,NA,NA,3,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""three schools""\n""all the three instructional conditions were realized in three\ndifferent classes[¬e]""']",,3,,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""three schools""\n""all the three instructional conditions were realized in three\ndifferent classes[¬e]""']",6,"['Page 1:\n[¬s]""three schools""\n""all the three instructional conditions were realized in three\ndifferent classes[¬e]""']",NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,Random (please specify),"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Classes were assigned randomly to the three conditions with two exceptions[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""in two\nschools, teachers had chosen to teach cooperatively or teacher guided, respectively,\nbefore the start of the study[¬e]""']",NA,,Class,NA,NA,,"['Individual RCT', 'Prospective QED']","['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Classes were assigned randomly to the three conditions with two exceptions[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""in two\nschools, teachers had chosen to teach cooperatively or teacher guided, respectively,\nbefore the start of the study[¬e]""']",NA,,Yes,"['Page 5:\n[¬s]""Classes were assigned randomly to the three conditions with two exceptions[¬e]""', 'Page 5:\n[¬s]""in two\nschools, teachers had chosen to teach cooperatively or teacher guided, respectively,\nbefore the start of the study[¬e]""']",NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

The experimental classes were taught by teachers trained in the use of the Student Teams-Achievement Divisions (STAD) method, while the control classes received the typical whole-class method of instruction from their teachers. Two forms of a standardized mathematics test (Tes Hasil Belajar) were administered and served as the pretest and posttest instruments. ANCOVA analyses were used to analyze the data with the pretest THB scores assigned as covariate. A series of t-test procedures were used to analyze the attitudinal data. A confidence level of 95% $(p < .05)$ was used to determine the statistical significance of the analyses. The findings indicate that the STAD classes performed significantly higher on tests of mathematics knowledge than the traditionally instructed classes. When the effect of the STAD method was examined for each student grade level, the findings indicate that the third-grade and fifth-grade students in the STAD group performed significantly higher than students in the traditionally instructed classes. No significant differences in mathematics achievement were found between the fourth-grade students in the STAD group and those who were in the control group.

40307358,Uttero (1992),1992,"This study developed and evaluated the Instruction-Modeling-Cooperative (I-M-C) engagement instructional model. It has two components  (1) explicit verbal instruction and modeling of five comprehension strategies (charting of prior knowledge, prediction, concept mapping, summarization, and question generation) and (2) the cooperative application of these strategies. In this model, the teacher provides theoretical information about the strategy and then models the method for the students, who then work together in cooperative learning groups to apply the technique to content area material. A prior knowledge test, devised for this experiment, and the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test were administered to 179 fourth and sixth grade students prior to the experiment. The I-M-C students received explicit instruction and modeling in the five comprehension strategies and worked together cooperatively to apply the techniques to the material in their science textbook. Control group students received traditional instruction (lecture, discussion, and completion of workbook/sheet activities). After twelve weeks three posttests, developed for this study, were administered  a cued recall comprehension test, a multiple choice test of science concepts, and a science attitude inventory, as well as the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. An experimental-control group design, with pretests and posttests, was used to test the effects of the independent variables (the I-M-C model, age, reading achievement level, and gender) on the dependent measures (reading comprehension, acquisition of science concepts, and attitude toward science). The study included a 2(treatment) x 2(grade) x 4(age) x 3(reading achievement level) x 2(gender) factorial design. Data were analyzed by employing a series of analyses of variance and analyses of covariance, with scores from the Gates-MacGinitie comprehension subtest and the prior knowledge tests as covariates. Results indicated that the I-M-C model was beneficial for enhancing comprehension, as measured by the cued recall test, acquisition of concepts, and attitude toward learning. It was not effective in improving comprehension as measured by the comprehension subtest of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. The findings suggested that the I-M-C model is effective at promoting comprehension of science material, the acquisition of science concepts, and a positive attitude toward science.","['Reading comprehension strategies', 'Collaborative learning']",NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Primary/elementary school'],NA,NA,,High ecological validity,NA,NA,,"['10', '9', '11', '12']",NA,NA,,1,NA,,,1,NA,,2,NA,,NA,NA,NA,4,NA,,4,,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,['No'],NA,NA,,"Non-random, not matched prior to treatment","['Page 74:\n[¬s]"" A one-way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between the two groups in total reading, F (1, 95) = 0.84, p > .05.

Six intact classes of two teachers were randomly assigned to one of three modes of instruction, ""Traditional Instruction,"" ""Student Team Learning,"" and ""Enhanced Cooperative Learning.""

Multiple regression procedures tested the hypotheses that cooperative learning is superior to traditional instruction and that the enhanced cooperative learning method is superior to the student team learning method. The statistical power of the analyses was increased by using sixth grade scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Test as a covariate. Random samples from the cooperative learning classes completed a questionnaire that measured self-regulation strategies pertinent to group work. Analyses of covariance revealed no significant differences between teachers or methods on the first test but a strong teacher effect on the second and third tests. The hypothesis that cooperative learning was superior to traditional instruction was also supported on the third test. When the data for each teacher were analyzed separately, both research hypotheses were significant for one teacher on the third test. The Student Questionnaire on Group Work, with a reliability coefficient of.90, proved a reliable and valid indicator of self-regulation strategies pertinent to cooperative group work. However, relatively low average responses on this measure suggested a need for continuing assessment and refinement of targeted social skills. The potential effectiveness of the Enhanced Cooperative Learning design may reside in better structuring of the self-regulation strategies.

Multiple regression procedures tested the hypotheses that cooperative learning is superior to traditional instruction and that the enhanced cooperative learning method is superior to the student team learning method. The statistical power of the analyses was increased by using sixth grade scores on the Metropolitan Achievement Test as a covariate. Random samples from the cooperative learning classes completed a questionnaire that measured self-regulation strategies pertinent to group work. Analyses of covariance revealed no significant differences between teachers or methods on the first test but a strong teacher effect on the second and third tests. The hypothesis that cooperative learning was superior to traditional instruction was also supported on the third test. When the data for each teacher were analyzed separately, both research hypotheses were significant for one teacher on the third test. The Student Questionnaire on Group Work, with a reliability coefficient of.90, proved a reliable and valid indicator of self-regulation strategies pertinent to cooperative group work. However, relatively low average responses on this measure suggested a need for continuing assessment and refinement of targeted social skills. The potential effectiveness of the Enhanced Cooperative Learning design may reside in better structuring of the self-regulation strategies. The results suggest that cooperative learning may be significantly more effective only after an extended period of staff development and exposure with students. Continuous evaluation of group work self-regulation strategies may point to subsequent refinements.",['Collaborative learning'],NA,,Dissertation,['Dissertation or thesis'],,NA,NA,,['USA'],,['Middle school'],"['Page 50:\n[¬s]""Oceanside Middle School[¬e]""']",NA,,High ecological validity,"['Page 47:\n[¬s]""Two seventh\ngrade math teachers participated.
