These 'disruptive' children were randomly assigned to four treatment conditions lasting the kindergarten school year  no treatment, parent training only, full-day treatment classroom only, and the combination of parent training with the classroom treatment. Results showed that parent training produced no significant treatment effects, probably owing largely to poor attendance. The classroom treatment produced improvement in multiple domains  parent ratings of adaptive behavior, teacher ratings of attention, aggression, self-control, and social skills, as well as direct observations of externalizing behavior in the classroom. Neither treatment improved academic achievement skills or parent ratings of home behavior problems, nor were effects evident on any lab measures of attention, impulse control, or mother-child interactions. It is concluded that when parent training is offered at school registration to parents of disruptive children identified through a brief school registration screening, it may not be a useful approach to treating the home and community behavioral problems of such children. The kindergarten classroom intervention was far more effective in reducing the perceived behavioral problems and impaired social skills of these children.

The purpose of this study was to determine if prekindergarten children who participated in an explicit phonological-awareness training program, which included their parents as teachers, entered kindergarten at a reading readiness level higher than would have been expected had they not participated in the program. An additional goal of this research was to demonstrate the utility of the regression discontinuity design in program evaluation. The independent variable (program treatment) was participation in a phonological awareness-based, kindergarten-readiness, summer program. The dependent variable (post-program measure) was the level of phonological awareness as measured by the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) kindergarten subtests. A kindergarten-readiness screening was used to assign students to program or nonprogram status. Results of this study yielded standardized effect sizes of 0.18 and 0.16. These treatment effects of the kindergarten-readiness summer program on the initial sounds fluency (ISF) and letter naming fluency (LNF) subtests of the DIBELS were small, but comparable to other studies of phonological awareness. Program gains of this magnitude are very important considering feasibility and duration of the independent variable. Additionally, students' scores increased 3.3 points on the DIBELS ISF and a 5.1 points on the DIBELS LNF. Comparing these scores to benchmarks of performance established in DIBELS research indicate that the program treatment contributed to substantial gains that warrant consideration in program evaluation. This study of the effectiveness of phonological awareness instruction with prekindergarten children added to current research on assessment procedures for early identification and early intervention of children who are at-risk, and provided data concerning the effectiveness of school readiness programs, specifically phonological awareness instruction for prekindergarten students.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://search.proquest.com/docview/85629540,NA,"Logan, UT",Utah State University

Use of the Adult/Child Interactive Reading Inventory (ACIRI) provided data about mother and child behaviors at pretest and posttest. An attitudinal measure assessed the trained mothers' self-efficacy as a literacy coach. Findings include direct effects on the mothers' ability to use the strategy as well as indirect effects on the children's emergent literacy behaviors. Statistically significant effects were found for concepts about print (p < .05) using an ANOVA.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Parent Readiness Education Project (PREP) on readiness skills and subsequent performance of preschool children.  Procedures. This was an ex-post-facto study using summative evaluative procedures. Seven hundred and thirty-six students from the Ballard, Eastside, Ellis, Howard, and Oak Manor elementary schools in the Niles Community School District, Niles, Michigan, were used in this evaluation. All the subjects had participated in the Title III federally funded PREP screening program which selected those students with anticipated learning problems for PREP training. Two hundred and fifty-nine children received PREP training.  One-way analysis of variance and one-way analysis of covariance were used to analyze the results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores, Caldwell Cooperative Preschool Inventory, and the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills subtests. Simple t-test for independent means and correlated means were used to analyze the pretest and posttest scores of the Caldwell Preschool Inventory.  Results. With the exception of the first annual group, the PREP students made significant gains in readiness skill areas in comparison to the Non-PREP and Non-Accepting PREP students. Follow-up studies at the end of kindergarten right through fourth grades continued to show significance in favor of the PREP group. In almost every case the PREP students had at least caught up with the Non-PREP students, and scored significantly higher than the Non-Accepting PREP group. However, for the first annual group the PREP students failed to close the gap between them and the Non-PREP in nine cases on the CTBS Subtests. Furthermore, they did not surpass the Non-Accepting PREP group in four subtests.  Conclusion.

The authors conclude that parents and children may expand their shared book reading experience to include e-books, which may serve as promising contexts for developing young children's language. © The Author(s) 2013.",33,5,504-523,https://doi.org/10.1177/0142723713503148,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0142723713503148,NA,NA,NA

The version of the Programme evaluated by this study (Peep-LTS) consisted of an initial home visit, then 20 weekly one-hour sessions held in the nursery setting, delivered by nursery practitioners and attended by parents and their child. The sessions provided parents with background information about how children learn and practical ideas and activities to help parents build on what they were already doing at home to make the most of everyday learning opportunities including listening, talking, playing, singing, and sharing books and stories. The Programme was evaluated via a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess effectiveness in improving language and literacy in the early years and explore the impact on the home learning environment and parental skills. The research team undertook semi-structured interviews with practitioners and parents in intervention settings  a usual practice survey was administered to all settings at the beginning of the trial and to control settings at the end, and an implementation survey was administered to all intervention settings during the trial. The evaluation project operated between January 2017 and December 2018, with the trial intervention period starting in January 2018 and ending in July 2018.

All children who participated in the interventions were identified by teachers as having difficulty in phonological awareness and word reading skills at the end of senior kindergarten. Two additional groups served as comparisons. Children in the 'low' comparison group had early literacy skills similar to children in the intervention groups. The 'average' comparison group included children that were identified by teachers as normally achieving in early literacy. The intervention programs sought to improve children's word reading ability by providing explicit instruction in phonological awareness and opportunities to practice other emergent literacy skills.

Sample. One hundred and four 5‐ and 6‐year‐old children selected from eight schools in an inner city disadvantaged community in London participated in the intervention. Methods. This is a randomized control trial with pre‐ and post‐measurements designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention.

Twenty Spanish-speaking mother-child dyads were assigned to one of two conditions (shared-book reading curriculum, or control condition). Child participants were tested at three points in time on general Spanish receptive and expressive vocabulary, knowledge of targeted words taught by the shared-book reading curriculum, knowledge of concepts about print (CAP) and oral narrative abilities (microstructure and macrostructure elements). Based on prior research, it was predicted that children in the intervention group would outperform their peers in the control group on all outcome variables at post-testing and at the 12-month follow-up. Results at post-testing revealed positive effects of the Spanish shared-book reading curriculum on measures of generalized receptive vocabulary, targeted receptive vocabulary, CAP, microstructural oral narrative skills (lengthier mean length utterances  MLU) for the story retell task and macrostructural oral narrative skills (story grammar) for the two oral narrative tasks (story retell and story spontaneous). Results at the 12- month follow-up revealed a positive impact of the intervention for the story retell task. Although we were unable to detect long-term sustained effects of the intervention on all child outcome variables, the pilot study makes a contribution to the literature by showing that teaching Low-SES Spanish-speaking parents how to use a scripted shared-book reading curriculum that incorporates cognitively complex questions about words and stories before, during and after reading, can produce positive impacts on children’s oral language, CAP and narrative skills at short-term.

(2) Are the Planned Variation models, simply by virtue of sponsorship more effective than ordinary nonsponsored Head Start programs? and (3) Are some Planned Variation models particularly effective at imparting certain skills? The first chapter gives an overall picture of the Head Start Planned Variation study, while the second chapter summarizes data concerning background characteristics and distribution of test scores. Chapter 3 provides a general discussion of methodological issues and some of the major difficulties resulting from the study design. Chapters 4-7 attempt to present a picture of the pattern of overall effects of various programs through ranking analysis, residual analysis, analysis of covariance, and resistant analysis. The final chapters explore the question of whether the relative effectiveness of various programs is related to certain child background characteristics, such as sex, ethnicity, age, prior school experience, and mother's education. One major conclusion drawn as a result of the intermodel comparisons was that Head Start programs are quite homogeneous in their ability to promote general cognitive development.",NA,NA,509,NA,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED093497,Huron Institute,"Cambridge, MA",Huron Institute
