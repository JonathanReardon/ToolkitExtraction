A variety of early literacy lessons were used in the areas of picture naming (assessment of expressive language development), rhyming, and alliteration (assessment of phonological awareness).""\n""For example, a goal of a rhyming lesson was for\nchildren to ﬁnd the rhymeswithin a particular poem or\nshort story. The activity was designed to help children\nunderstand and identify rhyming words. During the\nlesson, children would march in place while the\nteacher repeated several lines of a poem and the child\nidentiﬁed the words that rhymed.

Whereas these concepts were\ncovered at both the intervention and control site,\nthe primary difference was that the intervention site\nintegrated these lessons into a PA rather than teach\nsolely through large-group time, reading, or other\nclassroom activities.\nThe program was designed to keep the children\nmoving in moderate PA for 30 minutes 2 times per day\n(60minutes daily). Sixty minutes per day of moderate\nintensity PA was chosen as it is recommended by the\nNational Association for Sport and Physical Education\n(NASPE)26 and the National Association for the\nEducation of Young Children (NAEYC).27 Despite\nthese recommendations most preschool children\ndo not meet these recommendations28 Therefore,\nintegrating PA within the early literacy curriculum\ncould be an effective way to increase daily PA. The\nprogram was administered inside or outside of the\nclassroom, to music or without music. The goal was\nto make it fun and engaging for both the teachers\nand students. Teachers were free to choose the time\neach morning and afternoon that best ﬁt into the\nday’s schedule but each teacher was required to\nadminister a morning and afternoon session at a\ntime when it was likely that most if not all students\nwere in attendance (eg, after breakfast in the AM\nbut before children are picked up by parents in\nPM). During the 8 months, daily direct observation\nby the investigators was used to ensure that the PA\nlessons were administered appropriately. Throughout\nthe study, teachers in the intervention group were\nrequired to complete a daily activity log. To complete\nthe log, teachers indicated in which PA lesson was\nused, the time of day they performed the activity\nlesson, the total number of minutes that each activity\nlasted, and estimate the intensity level at which they\nbelieved the children were performing (ie, light-,\nmoderate-, or high-intensity levels).
