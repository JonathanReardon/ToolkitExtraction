53902058,Aber (2016),2016,"This article examines the impacts of Opportunity New York City-Family Rewards, the first holistic conditional cash transfer (CCT) program evaluated in the United States, on parental financial investments in children, and high school students' academic time use, motivations and self-beliefs, and achievement outcomes. Family Rewards, launched by the Center for Economic Opportunity in the Mayor's Office of the City of New York in 2007 and codesigned and evaluated by MDRC, offered cash assistance to low-income families conditioned on family investments in three areas  children's education, family preventive health care, and parents' employment. Results that rely on a random assignment design find that Family Rewards resulted in statistically significant increases in parental spending and saving on education for all students, and increased savings for those students most academically prepared at baseline and for girls, as well as statistically significant increases in academic time use and achievement outcomes for these same academically prepared students.

53901222,Ahmed (2006),2006,"The Conditional Cash Transfer program in Turkey is a targeted social assistance program that is designed to provide support to the poorest 6 percent of the Turkish population. CCT is a sub-component of the Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP) of the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Solidarity (SYDGM). The specific objectives of the CCT in Turkey are to increase school attendance rates for the poor, decrease dropout rates, increase immunization coverage, and enhance the utilization of health facilities for the 1.1 million target beneficiaries. The program uses an indicator-based administrative targeting method to identify ultrapoor households with children aged 0-6 years, school-aged children 6-17 years, and childbearing-age women. The main purpose of this interim impact evaluation report is to provide rapid feedback on program implementation and estimates of impacts of the CCT program. The study is based on a large-scale quantitative household survey of beneficiaries of the education and the childhealth components of the CCT program, and the comparison group of nonbeneficiaryapplicants.

53901693,Alam (2011),2011,"The Punjab Female School Stipend Program, a female-targeted conditional cash transfer program in Pakistan, was implemented in response to gender gaps in education. An early evaluation of the program shows that the enrollment of eligible girls in middle school increased in the short term by nearly 9 percentage points. This paper uses regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference analyses to show that five years into the program implementation positive impacts do persist. Beneficiary adolescent girls are more likely to progress through and complete middle school and work less. There is suggestive evidence that participating girls delay their marriage and have fewer births by the time they are 19 years old. Girls who are exposed to the program later, and who are eligible for the benefits given in high school, increase their rates of matriculating into and completing high school. The persistence of impacts can potentially translate into gains in future productivity, consumption, inter-generational human capital accumulation and desired fertility.

53901694,Alatas (2011),2011,"Household conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs offer countries a new way to tackle poverty and prevent the transmission of poverty to future generations. They do so by providing regular cash payments to families on the condition that they fulfill basic obligations, which are typically related to the usage of health and education services. The Government of Indonesia launched its own household conditional cash transfer program, Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH or Hopeful Family Program), in order to improve lagging health and education outcomes among extremely poor households. The program delivers quarterly cash transfers to very poor households with children or lactating/pregnant women provided that they fulfill a range of health and education-related obligations. PKH has emerged as one of the government's strategies to reduce poverty and reach its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Government of Indonesia is currently considering expanding coverage to 3 million households by 2014. This report presents the main findings from the impact evaluation of the PKH pilot. Chapter two describes the design of the household CCT program and a description of quality of implementation at the time of the impact evaluation. Chapter three summarizes the findings from the implementation assessments of the pilot. Chapter four reviews the design of the impact evaluation and provides an explanation about the research methodologies used. The main findings of the evaluation are presented in Chapter five.
