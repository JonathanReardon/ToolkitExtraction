The National Reading Panel (2000) concluded that specific vocabulary growth is best assessed through researcher- developed measures because these measures are more sensitive to gains achieved through instruction than are standardized tools. To assess specific vocabulary growth, we developed a 20-word instrument in which students were asked to produce word meanings or tell anything they knew about target words. Ten specific words were randomly selected from the pool of explicitly taught vocabulary, and the remaining 10 words were randomly selected from the pool of words that appeared in the stories but received no explicit instructional emphasis. No more than one word per story occurred in the measure. The measure was individually administered at pre- and postintervention in two separate sessions of 10 words each. Each assessment item consisted of two questions  (a) asking the definition of the word (e.g., “What is a principal?” “What does roared mean?”), and (b) asking a what, when, or how question (e.g., “What does a principal do?” “What do you do when you roar?”). To guide scoring, definitions for each word were specified, including dictionary definitions, synonyms, and the informal definition used during storybook instruction. A panel of four scorers further determined the criteria, awarding points to responses that did not match the listed definitions or synonyms. Student responses were scored on a scale of 0 to 3 points per word.

Each utterance by the child might consist of a single utterance or a series of utterances, but each series of utterances was coded with a single code of spontaneous utterance or response. The spontaneous comments were analyzed for the number of communication units (c-units) they contained. A c-unit is an independent clause along with any dependent clauses it contains (Loban, 1976). The c-unit system is identical to the t-unit system (Hunt , 1965), but it also accounts for some spoken language characteristics such as elliptical utterances. The children's comments were measured in c-units to account for any variation in complexity of comments.

This instrument was developed by Lloyd M. Dunn of the George Peabody College for Teachers, Nashville, Tennessee. This instrument consists of three practice and ISO test plates, each of which contains four numbered pictures. Alternate forms are available by using the same plates, but designating a different stimulus word for Form A and Form B. The examiner says the stimulus word and the subject responds by indicating orally or by pointing to the picture which best illustrates the word. Items are arranged in ascending order. The subject's basal response is de­ termined by giving the correct response to eight consecutive stimulus words. The subject's ceiling is reached when he experiences six failures out of eight consecutive responses. The directions for administering the test suggest appro­ priate starting points for different ages. The subject's score is determined by subtracting the number of incorrect responses from his ceiling response score. The subject's score can be converted into three types of derived scores  percentile rank, mental age, or standard score deviation IQ with a means of 100 and a standard deviation of fifteen.",,"['Toolkit primary outcome', 'Other outcome']",,0.3596,,0.26,,Literacy: speaking and listening/oral language,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,-0.15,,0.8692,,Primary outcome,,['Sample: All'],,With business as usual,,['Pre-post gain'],,['Test type: Standardised test '],,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,,NA,

That is, the test consisted of one plate for each target item. Each plate consisted of four illustrations, one representing the target item and three representing foils. The foils also represented items pictured in the book. For example, the plate for the label infant included a baby, a young girl, a woman and an elderly lady which were all represented in the book. The procedure for the receptive vocabulary tests was the same as the PPVT–R, that is, children were asked to point to a named item. If children hesitated to respond or said that they did not know the word, the experimenter said that some of the words were hard but to try just the same. The experimenter did not proceed to the next plate until children made a selection. If children changed their selection, the experimenter recorded the children’s last choice.
