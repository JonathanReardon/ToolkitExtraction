The intervention, Early Access to Success in Education (Project EASE), was designed to increase the frequency and quality of language interactions through book-centered activities and to give parents information about and opportunities for engagement in their children\'s developing literacy abilities. Parents received information about ways to strengthen vo- cabulary, extend narrative understanding, develop letter recognition and sound awareness, produce narrative retellings, and understand exposition. Measures of home literacy support were collected from parents and a battery of language and literacy tests were adminis- tered to intervention and comparison children prior to the interven- tion and at its conclusion. Children whose families engaged in the at- school and at-home activities made significantly greater gains in lan- guage scores as measured on subtests of vocabulary, story comprehension, and sequencing in story-telling than comparison children. Th[¬e]""', 'Page 7:\n[¬s]""Intervention procedure The intervention began in September with a series of orientation sessions for parents whose children were in the intervention classrooms. Each family received an explanatory letter from the district administration outlin- ing the program and met with the intervention teachers individually to learn about the scope and intention of the program (only three parents refused to participate). Parents were invited to an evening meeting where the program was further explained and the proposed process of parental involvement outlined. At that meeting an overview of the year\'s program and an explanation of the research principles involved were given. Concurrently, control families were informed that the project was being carried out, and all agreed to allow their children to be tested as part of a comparison group. The parent training sessions were organized in five 1-month units; in each unit a parent coaching session was led by a trained parent educator, working from a scripted discussion outline to assure fidelity across schools. All relevant information was also included in a take-home guide so that the concepts addressed in the sessions could be reviewed at will. Each parent education session was followed immediately by opportunities to en- gage in structured parent-child activities designed to pro- vide practice in the desired interaction. Each of the subsequent 3 weeks, the teachers sent home a set of scripted activities incorporating the principles that were the focus for that month. These structured activities in- cluded scripted interactions and demonstrations of how to engage children in extended discussions surrounding a book. Each book to be used in the at-home activities was specifically selected because its content and text design offered lexical richness, extended discourse opp""\n""ties, and interesting ideas to talk about. Thus, the scripted parent-child interactions fostered the types of high-quality language interactions that research has shown to be ef- fective in promoting language development. The se- quence, including a parent education session during which literacy activities were modeled and opportunities to practice those activities with the child were given and then scripted activities that were sent home from school every week, was repeated for each of the five interven- tion units.

The three\nSLP-CLASS-HM teachers held Bachelor’s degrees, and their teaching experience ranged from\n8–24 years.\nWe initially recruited 61 families from the SLP-CLASS-HM classrooms; however, 20 did\nnot participate in the home component. These children, though, did participate in the classroom\nactivities and were followed throughout the year.

The workshop presentation discussed how each of these skills is related to\nchildren\'s reading ability. The group also discussed the importance of creating a relaxed,\nsupportive environment during shared book reading, and that parents need to structure the\nbook reading experience so that children enjoy reading.""\n""To ensure that children are enjoying books, the workshop presented tips for choosing\n\'good books\' - books that children enjoy but are also useful for teaching phonological\nawareness and word reading. The workshop included information on the importance of\npattern, of repetitive phrases or words, of lyrical or rhythmic flow in the text, and of content\nthat appeals to children\'s interests.\nAt the end of the first session, the facilitator read each of the five books used for the\nchildren\'s camp program, demonstrating different characteristics of the books and different\ntechniques for shared reading. The techniques demonstrated how different types of books\ncould be used to support growth in children\'s vocabulary, general knowledge, and\ncomprehension, and children\'s understanding of print concepts and syntactic structure[¬e]""', 'Page 59:\n[¬s]""Parents were encouraged to be \'expressive\' readers so that, in addition to learning emergent\nliteracy skills, children also would be entertained by the book reading experience.""\n""The second workshop focused on phonological awareness specifically. This session\nincluded an explanation of phonological awareness and an explanation of its importance for\nreading acquisition. Parents learned that there were three types of phonological awareness\n(syllable, rhyme, and phoneme) that most often develop in sequence. Parents learned to\nrecognize their own child\'s level of phonological awareness and were shown how to focus\nchildren\'s learning at their current level.""\n""The second part of the workshop presented different types of phonological awareness\nskills. To demonstrate, the workshop facilitator described the phonological awareness items\nin the assessment battery. The test battery includes tasks where children are asked to identify,\nsegment, and blend phonological units. Parents also learned that other tasks, not used in this\nassessment battery, ask children to manipulate or substitute phonological units. Parents were\nasked to consider these types of activities (identifying, segmenting, blending, and\nmanipulating) when thinking of different phonological awareness activities for their own""\n""At the end of this workshop, parents worked in small groups to discuss the ways that\nphonological activities could be incorporated into home routines. After working in small\ngroups, parents presented different phonological awareness activities that they could perform\nat home. Working together with the facilitator, the group considered ways to modify\nchildren\'s favourite activities into \'phonological\' activities, for example, while playing catch,\ntry to say another rhyming word each time you catch the ball; see how many rhyming words\nthe group can come up with in a row[¬e]""', 'Page 60:\n[¬s]""At the end of the second workshop, the facilitator again stressed the importance of\nparents taking an active role in supporting their child\'s learning. It was acknowledged that\nsome parents may have had negative experiences at school, but that children deserve a \'fresh\nstart\', and that parents should not project their own negative attitudes about education onto\nchildren. The final point encouraged parents to try the phonological awareness activities and\nbook reading activities with their own children; the activities may seem silly to adults but\nchildren often really enjoy them - or at the very least, enjoy that parents are engaged in the\nactivities with them.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['Page 3:\n[¬s]""to evaluate the influence of a summer intervention for\nchildren showing early signs of reading delay.[¬e]""']",NA,,"['University/ researcher design', 'Other (please provide details)']","['Page 168:\n[¬s]""The author co-facilitated one session in the pilot study\n(2004) and all parent sessions in 2006; the author\'s advisor facilitated one session in the pilot\nstudy; the community\'s \'Early Literacy Specialist\' facilitated sessions for three of the parent\ngroups in 2005; and the community\'s \'Early Years Coordinator\' co-facilitated one session in\nthe pilot study and sessions for one parent group in 2005[¬e]""', 'Page 168:\n[¬s]""As the research took place over a period of three years, different people were enlisted\nto facilitate the parent workshops.

(Description on page 150.) The core of the programme was a structured curriculum built on the matrix of proximal goals, specifying all kinds of educational activities to be carried out collaboratively at home by mother and child. The curriculum covered two years (effectively, 30 weeks in each year) and was presented to the mothers on weekly instructions and worksheets, which specified activities for five days each week. In total, there were 150 planned activities per year. Carrying out the daily activities was estimated to take about 20 minutes each day. In addition to the worksheets, the programme provided all kinds of materials to be used in the activities, such as pencils, scissors, audiotapes with nursery rhymes and songs, and picture books. Instructions to the mothers about how to carry out the activities were written on instruction sheets in clear, simple language and, in view of the low literacy skills of many of the target mothers, supported by pictorial illustrations. For fully illiterate mothers, stories and songs were also made available on audiotape. Worksheets, instruction sheets, materials, books, and tapes were all attractively designed. Picture books were written by well-known authors of children’s books.  The mothers were supported by paraprofessional aides who were to explain the worksheets and demonstrate appropriate interactional behaviour. These paraprofessionals were experienced mothers themselves, belonged to the same communities as the target families, lived mostly in the same neighbourhoods, spoke their languages, but were on average slightly better educated. Paraprofessional aides were recruited locally by the coordinators, from the Moroccan target group. They were usually known by the coordinators because of their active participation in the neighbourhood. They received an introductory training (8–10 days) and were further trained on the job by their local coordinator. According to the plan, the paraprofessionals visited the families every two weeks (planned number of visits  15 in each year) or, alternatively, organised small group meetings in a nearby neighbourhood centre. In addition to instructing and supporting the mothers, the paraprofessionals were also asked to keep records of the actual implementation of the programme activities, thus being an essential instrument of the programme’s implementation strategy and implementation monitoring system.  In addition to the support by paraprofessionals, the programme also organised monthly group meetings (planned number of meetings  12 per year) for the mothers in a neighbourhood centre, headed by the local coordinator. A portion of the group meetings was used for providing additional information on the worksheets. There was also time for discussing general child-rearing themes brought in by the parents. However, the main purpose of the group meetings was to provide information about general principles of authoritative and emotionally supportive, sensitive-responsive interaction styles. A videotape showing a model mother-child interaction was used for demonstrating these principles.
