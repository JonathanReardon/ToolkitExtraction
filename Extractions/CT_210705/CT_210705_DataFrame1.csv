Family Rewards, launched by the Center for Economic Opportunity in the Mayor's Office of the City of New York in 2007 and codesigned and evaluated by MDRC, offered cash assistance to low-income families conditioned on family investments in three areas  children's education, family preventive health care, and parents' employment. Results that rely on a random assignment design find that Family Rewards resulted in statistically significant increases in parental spending and saving on education for all students, and increased savings for those students most academically prepared at baseline and for girls, as well as statistically significant increases in academic time use and achievement outcomes for these same academically prepared students. There were no impacts on student motivations and self-beliefs.

CCT is a sub-component of the Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP) of the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Solidarity (SYDGM). The specific objectives of the CCT in Turkey are to increase school attendance rates for the poor, decrease dropout rates, increase immunization coverage, and enhance the utilization of health facilities for the 1.1 million target beneficiaries. The program uses an indicator-based administrative targeting method to identify ultrapoor households with children aged 0-6 years, school-aged children 6-17 years, and childbearing-age women. The main purpose of this interim impact evaluation report is to provide rapid feedback on program implementation and estimates of impacts of the CCT program. The study is based on a large-scale quantitative household survey of beneficiaries of the education and the childhealth components of the CCT program, and the comparison group of nonbeneficiaryapplicants.

53901694,Alatas (2011),2011,"Household conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs offer countries a new way to tackle poverty and prevent the transmission of poverty to future generations. They do so by providing regular cash payments to families on the condition that they fulfill basic obligations, which are typically related to the usage of health and education services. The Government of Indonesia launched its own household conditional cash transfer program, Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH or Hopeful Family Program), in order to improve lagging health and education outcomes among extremely poor households. The program delivers quarterly cash transfers to very poor households with children or lactating/pregnant women provided that they fulfill a range of health and education-related obligations. PKH has emerged as one of the government's strategies to reduce poverty and reach its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Government of Indonesia is currently considering expanding coverage to 3 million households by 2014. This report presents the main findings from the impact evaluation of the PKH pilot. Chapter two describes the design of the household CCT program and a description of quality of implementation at the time of the impact evaluation. Chapter three summarizes the findings from the implementation assessments of the pilot. Chapter four reviews the design of the impact evaluation and provides an explanation about the research methodologies used. The main findings of the evaluation are presented in Chapter five.

We compare these predictions with actual programme impacts as a way of assessing whether the programme has had the expected impact on children's human capital development given the institutional environment. We find that the programme has had an impact on the margins we would expect, and the size of the impact on secondary school enrolment of this unconditional programme is comparable with those from conditional programmes in other parts of the world.

53901695,Armand (2018),2018,"This report evaluates the impact of the Conditional Cash Transfer for Secondary School Education program in the Republic of Macedonia, and compares alternative designs of this program at the end of its second and third years. The progrtam provides cash transfers to poor households (those eligible for social assistance) if they have children of the secondary school age who attend secondary school at least 85 per cent of the time. The total amount of the subsidy is 12,000 Macedoniandenars (MKD) per year paid in quarterly instalments. The program was first implemented at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year. Different variants of the payment scheme were implemented from the start of the program. Firstly, the quarterly payments could be MKD 3000 each or there could be a bonus at the end of the school year. In the latter scheme, the first three payments are of MKD 2000 each and the last payment is of MKD 6000. Secondly, the identity of the transfer recipient could be either the child's mother or the head of the child's household. The comparison of different designs of the program is experimental, with different schemes implemented in different municipalities. There was random assignment of alternative payment designs to municipalities, through a lottery. We first randomized the 84 municipalities in Macedonia into two groups. In one group of 42 municipalities, the mother receives the payment. In the other group of 42 municipalities, the household head receives the payment, regardless of gender. We then conducted a secondary lottery, again dividing the municipalities into two equal groups of 42. One group receives the payment in equal installments and the other receives a graduation or end of year bonus. These two lotteries ensure that the municipalities receiving different payment mpdalities are very similar, and therefore comparable. Measuring the overall impact of the program (rather than comparing different designs) is more difficult since the program is implemented simultaneously in the whole country, so the choice of a control group to evaluate the program is not straightforward. We use a difference-in-differences strategy in this study. The group of eligible households comprises social financial assistance recipients with children of secondary school age. The comparison group (slightly better off group) consists of child allowance recipients with children of secondary school age. Although the two groups are different and therefore not immediatly comparable, the assumption of this method is that the trend in outcomes experienced by child allowance households is the same as what would be experienced by social financial assistance households in the absence of the conditional cash transfer. In order to evaluate the program and its different modalities, we collected three waves of a rich household survey that we matched with school records on school attendance and performance.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

The analysis relies on data from the Living Standards Measurement Survey of 2008. It uses a propensity score matching technique to identify the impact of the program by replicating the selection criteria followed by the government. Our results show that the program increased school enrollment and was able to reduce child labor in both areas. In rural areas, the impact of the program on education outcomes was restricted to enrollment in middle school where we estimated an increase of 10.2 percentage points (pp). The program also increased the proportion of children that completed elementary school by 13.8 pp, although it did not have an impact on enrollment in elementary or high school. In indigenous areas, the impact of the program on education outcomes was restricted to enrollment in elementary school where we estimate an increase of 7.9 pp. Additionally, the results show that the program reduced child labor in children ages 12 to 15 in both areas  by 10.1 pp in rural areas and 15.8 pp in indigenous areas. With regard to preventive health care services, we found no evidence of impact on the numbers of visits to health care providers or the number of vaccines that children received. However, we estimated that the proportion of women who had a Papanicolau test screening because of the program increased by 11.7 pp in rural areas and 14.7 pp in indigenous areas. Sadly, we found that the program might also have led to an increase in the number of pregnancies in rural areas  the proportion of pregnant women in 2008 was 3.2 pp higher in the beneficiary group than in the control group, and the number of pregnancies since the beginning of the program increased by 0.44 among beneficiaries – despite the fact that the number of children ages 3 to 6, who were born before the implementation of the program, was not statistically different between the groups.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,
53901268,Attanasio (2004),2004,"From introduction  In recent years, international financial institutions, policy-makers and economists have paid considerable attention to micro development policies based on cash transfers targeted to poor families and released only if the potential beneficiaries comply with specific conditions. Such conditional cash transfers have been particularly popular in education and nutrition policies – that is, in policies whose aim is to foster the accumulation of human capital among young children. In the case of the nutrition interventions, the conditions are often that the mother of the children, who receives the transfers, enrols them to development and growth check-ups and/or attends hygiene, vaccination and contraception courses. Much of the attention on conditional transfer programmes originated from the perceived success of a large programme of this nature started in rural Mexico in 1998 and evaluated scientifically with semi-experimental methods. Since the evidence on PROGRESA, as the Mexican programme was known, has received much attention, several international organisations have been promoting similar interventions in many developing countries and in particular in Latin America. It should be stressed that while PROGRESA has been widely branded as a success and has surely improved the nutritional and development outcomes of very young children and enrolment for secondary school, the reasons behind this success are not entirely obvious. In particular, it is not completely clear whether the conditionalities imposed by the programme played a role in determining the outcomes and what that role was.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

Although there is significant evidence showing that they have positive impacts on school participation, little is known about the long-term impacts of the programs on human capital. This paper investigates whether cohorts of children from poor households that benefited up to nine years from Familias en Acción, a conditional cash transfer program in Colombia, attained more school and performed better on academic tests at the end of high school. Identification of program impacts is derived from two different strategies using matching techniques with household surveys, and regression discontinuity design using a census of the poor and administrative records of the program. The authors show that, on average, participant children are 4 to 8 percentage points more likely than nonparticipant children to finish high school, particularly girls and beneficiaries in rural areas. Regarding long-term impact on tests scores, the analysis shows that program recipients who graduate from high school seem to perform at the same level as equally poor non-recipient graduates, even after correcting for possible selection bias when low-performing students enter school in the treatment group. Although the positive impacts on high school graduation may improve the employment and earning prospects of participants, the lack of positive effects on test scores raises the need to further explore policy actions to couple the program's objective of increasing human capital with enhanced learning.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

This paper summarizes the short-term impacts of a cash transfer program on the empowerment of adolescent girls in Malawi during and immediately after the two-year intervention. We find that the program, which transferred cash directly to school-age girls as well as their parents, had effects on a broad range of important domains - including increased access to financial resources, improved schooling outcomes, decreased teen pregnancies and early marriages, better health - and generally enabled beneficiaries to improve their agency within their households. Underlying these overall impacts, the experiment revealed important differences in program effects between young women who were in school at the start of the intervention and those that were not, as well as between young women who received cash transfers conditional on regular school attendance and those who received cash unconditionally.

This paper presents one-year schooling impacts from a conditional cash transfer experiment among teenage girls and young women in Malawi, which was designed to address these shortcomings  conditionality status, size of separate transfers to the schoolgirl and the parent, and village-level saturation of treatment were all independently randomized.

53901982,Barham (2012),2012,"CCT programs have become the anti-poverty program of choice in many developing countries. Numerous evaluations, often based on rigorous experimental designs, leave little doubt that such programs can increase enrollment and grades attained--in the short term. But evidence is notably lacking on whether these short-term gains translate into longer-term educational benefits needed to fully justify these programs. This paper uses the randomized phase-in of the RPS CCT program in Nicaragua to estimate the long-term effects on educational attainment and learning for boys, measured 10 years after the start of the program. We focus on a cohort of boys aged 9-12 years at the start of the program in 2000 who, due to the program's eligibility criteria and prior school dropout patterns, were likely to have benefitted more in the group of localities that were randomly selected to receive the program first. We find that the short-term program effect of a half grade increase in schooling for boys was sustained after the end of the program and into early adulthood. In addition, results indicate significant and substantial gains in both math and language achievement scores, an approximately one-quarter standard deviation increase in learning outcomes for the now young men. Hence in Nicaragua, schooling and achievement gains coincided, implying important longterm returns to CCT programs.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,
53901992,Behrman (2000),2000,"Increasing human capital investments in children is considered to be among the most effective ways of alleviating poverty and encouraging growth in developing countries. One possibly important channel through which such investments may have such impacts is through increasing cognitive achievement of children. Previous literature suggests that improved cognitive achievement has payoffs in terms of greater wages and perhaps productivities in labor markets in developing countries. This paper evaluates the short-run effects on children’s cognitive achievements of PROGRESA. One major component of PROGRESA is transfer payments to poor families with children enrolled in grades 3-6 of primary school and grades 1-3 of secondary school. Other components of PROGRESA include general transfers to such families and explicit nutrition supplements and health support for infants and small children. PROGRESA might have impact on children’s cognitive achievement through a number of channels, some of which are relatively short run and others are relatively longer run. Previous IFRPIPROGRESA Evaluation Project papers have considered some aspects of possible changes induced by PROGRESA that may have led or may eventually lead to improved cognitive achievement. But none of these studies consider the effects on child achievement test scores. Section 1 introduces the topic. Section 2 describes the PROGRESA program, with emphasis on the features directly related to schooling, which focus on enrollment and attendance. The payment schedule for transfers for school attendance is presented and discussed, with reference to the increasing payments with grade level because of perceived increasing opportunity costs with grade levels and higher payments for females than for males atthe secondary level because of perceived lower enrollment rates for females than males at those levels. Section 3 outlines methods for estimating the impact of PROGRESA on test scores. These include methods to control to the extent that the data permit for changing composition of those who take the tests. If, for example, PROGRESA induces greater enrollments of marginal students, the change in composition of the students taking the tests in itself will cause test scores to fall. Section 4 presents data on enrollments and summarizes the patterns in enrollment because the program is directly conditional on enrollment, as well as patterns in age-specific schooling attainment gaps. These estimates address three general points  1. The Relation Between Pre-program Enrollments and Differential Incentives by Age and Sex in the Payment Structure  (i) In the pre-PROGRESA 1997 data, enrollment rates averaged over 90% for the 7-11 age range, and then fell by about 10 percent for every added year of age. This is consistent with the general pattern of incentives from transfers becoming positive for later grades of primary school and increasing with the grade level But itsuggests that the incentives could have little effect for primary grades 3, 4 and possibly 5 because most children in these grades are in the 8-11 age range and over 90% of this age range were enrolled prior to PROGRESA. Thus, from looking at the pre-program data alone, it would appear that the same resources could have been used more effectively to increase enrollments by directing them more to higher grades and older children. (ii) In the pre-PROGRESA 1997 data, enrollment rates fell substantially for ages right above those at which most children finished primary school – ages 12-14, which relates to the rationale for the large percentage increase in the transfers for secondary grade 1. But enrollments continued to fall fairly sharply for still older ages, at which ages many children who are still in school are in secondary grade 2 or higher. So it is not clear that such a sharp increase in the transfer between primary grade 6 and secondary grade 1 compared to the increases for advancing in secondary school beyond grade 1 is warranted as is embodied in the program. (iii) In the pre-PROGRESA 1997 data, there was not a systematic difference in enrollment rates between females and males for the 6-10 age range. For ages 11 and older enrollment rates were higher for males than for females. These data, thus, prima facie seem consistent with the rationale for higher transfers for femalesthan for males because the former have lower enrollment rates for secondary school ages that are embodied in the PROGRESA transfer schedule. But part of this gender difference in age-specific enrollment rates does notreflect that females are receiving less schooling, but that males lag behind the standard grade progression rate more than do females because of lower grade progression rates. The average gaps in schooling attainment were in fact generally larger for males than for females. Thus there seems to be no basis in terms of schooling gaps or schooling attainment prior to PROGRESA for favoring females relative to males. Males apparently had higher enrollment rates in the age range 11-18 because they were on the average behind the females in age-specific schooling attainment, not ahead. So if it were desirable to have differential incentives by gender, it would seem that they should have favored males, not females. 2. Whether Enrollments and Schooling Gaps Were Different Between the Treatment and Control Samples Prior to PROGRESA  There was random assignment of localities between treatment and control groups. But that does not mean that households or individuals are randomly assigned between treatment and control groups. In fact, a previous project study finds that although on the locality level characteristics appear to be random between control and treatment samples, on the household and individual levels they differ systematically more oftenthan would be expected were there random assignment by household or individuals. But prior to PROGRESA enrollment rates and schooling gap rates indeed were not different between the control and treatment groups at the individual level. 3. The Impact of PROGRESA on Enrollments and Schooling Gaps  These estimates indicate significant enrollment rate increases for the treatment group beyond those for the control group between 1997 and 1999 for 12-14 year olds. For each of these ages for which the estimates are significant the estimates are larger for females than are those for males -- 11.9% versus 2.1% for 12 year olds, 8.8% versus 7.2% for 13 year olds, and 13.2% versus 5.8% for 14 year olds – and only the estimates for females, not for males, are significantly nonzero. Therefore PROGRESA seems to have been effective basically in increasing enrollments of females in the 12-14 age range. This success is consistent with the intent to focus on the ages related to the transition from primary to secondary school and the initial grades of secondary school for which previous dropout rates were high and with the intent to favor females. This latter success, however, may have exacerbated the gender gap in schooling attainment because, as noted above, even though age-specific enrollment rates prior to the program were lower for females than for males, age-specific schooling gaps were higher (and schooling attainment lower) for males than for females apparently because females had higher promotion rates than males. The lack of significant impact on enrollments of individuals younger than 12 is not surprising given the observation above about the high enrollment rates for such individuals in the pre-PROGRESA data – but it reinforces the point made above about whether the resources for transfers currently used for enrollment in primary 3 and 4 and perhaps 5 could be more effective if they were used for higher grades of school. With regard to the schooling gap, the overall estimates indicate significant reductions of this gap in the treatment relative to the control group of -0.15 grades for 11 year olds and of -0.31 grades for 15 year olds. Thus the latter provides some evidence of effects on teenagers, but for fewer ages than for enrollments. This is plausible both because the program is focused more on enrollments than attainment and because enrollments reflect shorter-run decisions and outcomes at the start of the year rather than for the whole year as for grade completion. The suggestion of an impact on 11 year olds is interesting because there is no evidence of significant impact on enrollments for that age or younger individuals. That means that any effect on the schooling gap for that age was due to a higher grade progression rate. The magnitudes of the estimates for females and malesseparately for these two ages, finally, indicate that the effects are the same by gender (though only those for 15 year olds are significantly nonzero at the 5% level). This contrasts with the enrollment results and also means that for the limited time period for which schooling gap estimates can be made, so far PROGRESA does not seem to have exacerbated gender gaps despite the results for a longer period for enrollment that suggests that it may have done so. Section 5 presents data on achievement and estimates of the impact of the program on achievement test scores. To permit evaluation of the impact of PROGRESA on achievement test scores, PROGRESA arranged for the Secretary of Pubic Education (Secretaría de Educación Pública, SEP) to administer the same tests for students in schools attended by individuals in the PROGRESA Evaluation Sample as SEP administers annually to a national sample of schools. These tests were administered to students in about 500 primary and secondary schools in the localities in the PROGRESA Evaluation Sample plus schools close to these localities. These test data have some important limitations for the analysis ofthis paper  (1) Only the shorter-run effects -- basically for the first year -- can be investigated even though some of the more important impact of PROGRESA on cognitive achievement,",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,
53901232,Behrman (2004),2004,"The Program Oportunidades (formerly PROGRESA) has been operating in small rural communities since 1997, providing cash grants to families in exchange for regular school attendance of children and youth as well as regular health clinic attendance and nutritional supplements for infants and very young children and for pregnant and lactating women. This paper provides estimates of the medium-term impacts on education for rural children aged 0 to 8 in 1997 just prior to the initial rural intervention, or those aged 6 to 14 in the 2003 Rural Evaluation Survey. The education of the oldest children within this age range would have been expected to have been affected primarily by the scholarship component of the program. The education of the youngest children within this age range, in contrast, would not have been affected directly by the scholarship component of the program by 2003 because they were too young to have advanced by then to the third grade at which the scholarships begin (though there may have been indirect effects through expectations about scholarships in the future). But on the other hand, these children were beneficiaries of the infant nutritional supplements, which may have improved their educational performance when they became of school age. The results in this paper extend those of previous evaluations based on the Rural Evaluation Surveys between 1998 and 2000 and are complementary to the concurrent evaluation for rural children aged 15-21 in 2003. Our analysis is based on new information provided in the 2003 Rural Evaluation Survey (ENCEL), which is linked with earlier data, in particular the 1997 pre-program Survey of Household Socio-economic Characteristics (ENCASEH) data. The ENCEL2003 provides another round of information on the original evaluation treatment and control households who began receiving Oportunidades benefits in 1998 and 2000 respectively. The original program evaluation was characterized by a random experiment with households from 320 communities with less than 2,500 inhabitants being assigned to receive benefits (T1998) and households from 186 being assigned to receive benefits approximately 18 months later (T2000).

This article uses a Markov schooling transition model applied to the experimental data to assess the impact of the subsidy program on schooling attainment and on the underlying behaviors that determine schooling attainment, including ages of matriculation, dropout rates, grade repetition rates, and school reentry rates. Results show that the program increases schooling attainment effectively by reducing dropout rates and facilitating grade progression, particularly during the transition from primary to secondary school. Many of these effects would not be clear if attention were limited to enrollments as in much of the previous literature.

The per household transfer was much larger than an earlier experiment, but it yielded smaller short-run effects on school enrollment, child labor participation, and use of health services. One explanation is that Bono 10,000 did not apply conditions to all children  only one school-age child in participating households was subject to the education condition, and young children and mothers were only subject to the health conditions in the absence of school-age children. Consistent with this, we find a large enrollment increase (and offsetting decrease in labor participation) among households with one eligible child and smaller and insignificant effects on children in larger households. We only find significant effects on health service use among children and mothers in the absence of a school-age child (despite a smaller household transfer).

It was expected that many families would find it difficult to keep their children in school and that dropout rates would be high, as they were during a recession in the 1980s. But dropouts did not increase markedly and enrollment rates remained relatively steady. The author examines the role the scholarship program played in producing this result. She found the scholarships to have been effective in reducing dropouts in the lower secondary school (where students are more susceptible to dropping out) by about 3 percentage points. They had no discernible impact in primary and upper secondary schools. The author also examines how well the program adhered to its documented targeting design and how effective that design was in reaching the poor. Committees that allocated the scholarships followed the criteria diligently, but a significant percentage of scholarships did go to students from households with high reported per capita expenditures, if household expenditure data are reliable. It is unclear how targeting can be improved, giving the scarcity of accurate local household data in most countries. Using local monitoring could help but then monitoring for accountability would be more difficult. Preliminary evidence favors focusing safety net scholarships--designed to reduce dropout rates during an economic crisis--on lower secondary schools, continuing to target children (especially older students) from large families, scaling back scholarships to private schools at the lower secondary level, or targeting the households hurt most by the crisis.""",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

It describes Brazil's transfer programs and presents statistics on school attendance and child labor.

Although conditional cash transfer programs in Brazil have been in place since 1996, studies on their ex-post impact are very few.

These preliminary results suggest that these programs have not been effective in fighting child labor in Brazil.

Using interactions between the targeting criteria and the treatment indicator, estimates suggest that children located in more impoverished localities experienced a larger impact of the program on schooling in 2001, but this finding is reversed in 2002. Estimated quantile treatment effects indicate that there is considerable heterogeneity in the impacts of the program on the distribution of food expenditures, as well as total expenditures. In particular, households at the lower end of the expenditure distribution experienced a smaller increase in expenditures. This study also presents evidence of the rank invariance assumption to help clarify the interpretation of the quantile treatment effect in the development literature context.",NA,NA,,"Journal, Article",NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,
53902005,Davis (2002),2002,"In this paper, we examine how the design of cash transfer schemes influences household welfare outcomes with particular reference to the influence of transfers on conditioned outcomes, such as schooling, health and investment. We do this by examining two innovative cash transfer schemes initiated by the Mexican government in the last decade  PROGRESA, which is a national antipoverty scheme directed at chronic rural poverty, and PROCAMPO, which is a scheme designed to compensate farmers for the negative price effects of NAFTA. The schemes differ in that PROGRESA is targeted at women and conditioned on schooling and health outcomes and PROCAMPO is generally targeted at men and conditioned on land use. The analysis of data collected for an evaluation of PROGRESA suggest that the overall effects of the programs, as measured by total and food consumption expenditure, are not different. However, PROGRESA leads to greater schooling expenditure and school attendance as well as increased health outcomes. On the other hand, PROCAMPO is found to lead to increased investment in agriculture. The results suggest that conditionality may have little effect in terms of short-term welfare outcomes, but do influence both longer-term (human capital) and medium term (productive) investment. Policy makers must consider both whether or not conditions should be placed on a program, and the type of condition, depending on what they perceive to be the desirables outcomes of the transfer scheme.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

An initiative of the government of Lebanon, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme (WFP), the programme provided cash for the benefit of children enrolled in afternoon shifts at public primary schools. It was designed to cover the cost of commuting to school and to compensate households for income forgone because children were attending school instead of working. Commuting costs and forgone income are two critical barriers to child school participation. The analysis relies on a geographical regression discontinuity design to identify the impact halfway through the first year of programme operation, the 2016/2017 school year. The analysis finds substantive impacts on school attendance among enrolled children, which increased by 0.5 days to 0.7 days per week, an improvement of about 20 per cent relative to the control group.

53901240,De Janvry (2006),2006,"Bolsa Escola was a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program that offered mothers in poor households a monthly stipend if their children ages 6 to 15 attended school on a regular basis. The program was implemented across all of Brazil between the years 2001 and 2003, until it was folded into the broader Bolsa Familia program (Lindert, 2005). An original feature of the program is that it was decentralized at the municipal level, entrusting the municipality with roles in the selection of beneficiaries and implementation of the transfers. Expectedly, with decentralization, there can be considerable variation in the quality of implementation of the program and the magnitude of its impact on school outcomes according to municipal characteristics, due in particular to elements of local political economy in decision making. This paper follows on a 2005 report that analyzed the role of municipalities in implementing the Bolsa Escola program (de Janvry, Finan, Sadoulet, Nelson, Lindert, de la Brière, and Lanjouw, 2005, subsequently referred to as the 2005 Report). The analysis was based on a survey of 261 municipalities in four states of the Northeast. In that report, analysis was conducted at the municipal level, focusing on four municipal roles  beneficiary identification, beneficiary selection, monitoring-verification-enforcement of the school attendance conditionality, and implementation of accountability mechanisms through both a short route via a local council and a long route via electoral rewards on incumbent mayors.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,
53902101,Dearden (2005),2005,"This paper examines the impact of a program that subsidizes children to remain in school for up to two years beyond the statutory age. The programme was first piloted in a number of areas in England from September 1999. Evaluating such interventions is of course critical to the shaping of education policy and the effectiveness or otherwise of a conditional cash transfer to 16 and 17 year olds on school dropout rates is of general policy interest to policy makers worldwide. The authors find that the impact of the subsidy is quite substantial, especially for those who receive the maximum payment. The subsidy increases the initial education participation of eligible males by 4.8 percentage points and eligible females by 4.2 percentage points. In the second year this increases to 7.6 percentage points for eligible males and 5.3 percentage points for females, suggesting that the effect of the policy is not only to increase participation, but also retention in full-time education. The initial effects are largest for those who receive the maximum payment although the retention effects are concentrated among individuals who are only partially eligible. The authors estimate that just over half of individuals who stayed in education were drawn from inactivity rather than work. The overall impact of the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) was not diminished when it was paid to the mother rather than to the child, though there is some weak evidence that paying to the child is more effective for those fully eligible whereas the opposite is true for those who are partially eligible. The authors also find that the effect of EMA is largest for children coming from a poorer socio-economic background. Both girls and boys coming from low-income families who qualify for the full EMA payment have very high drop out rates and the EMA has proved especially effective in plugging the dropout gap for this vulnerable group.

Purpose We investigate the overall impact ofJuntosupon educational outcomes of beneficiary children. Specifically, we address two questions  doesJuntoshave an impact on school participation? Can programme participation be linked to impacts upon cognitive skills? Approach and methods We use a quasi-experimental design that combines kernel matching with difference-in-difference estimation.

Findings The article reports three main findings  (a)Juntosincreases the chances of school enrolment and finishing primary school among children aged 12 to 18 years  (b) there is a positive effect on the transition to secondary school among the same age group, which is, however, only weakly significant at the 10% level  and (c) there is no positive impact on test scores of maths and language development among primary or secondary school-aged children.

53902109,Edo (2017),2017,"Argentina has traditionally stood out in terms of educational outcomes among its Latin American counterparts. Schooling of older children, however, still shows room for improvement especially among the more vulnerable. Fortunately, during the last years a sizeable improvement in attendance rates for children aged 15 through 17 took place. This could be related to the 2006 National Education Law that made upper-secondary education compulsory. In this paper, instead, we claim that the Asignación Universal por Hijo (Universal Child Allowance, AUH) --a massive conditional cash transfer program implemented in 2009 in Argentina-- may be mostly responsible for this improvement. Using a difference-in-difference strategy we estimate that the program accounts for a 3.9 percentage point increase in the probability of attending secondary school among eligible children aged 15 through 17.

53901624,Figueroa (2014),2014,"The Mexican Oportunidades program is designed to increase human capital through investments in education, health, and nutrition for children in extreme poverty. Although the program is not expressly designed to promote a child's cognitive and non-cognitive development, the set of actions carried out by the program could eventually facilitate improvements in these domains. Previous studies on the Oportunidades program have found little impact on children's cognition but have found positive effects on their non-cognitive development. However, the majority of these studies use the average outcome to measure the impact of the program and thus overlook other ""non-average"" effects. This paper uses stochastic dominance methods to investigate results beyond the mean by comparing cumulative distributions for both children who are and children who are not aided by the program. Four indicators of cognitive development and one indicator of non-cognitive development are analyzed using a sample of 2595 children aged two to six years. The sample was collected in rural communities in Mexico in 2003 as part of the program evaluation. Similar to previous studies, the program is found to positively influence children's non-cognitive abilities  children enrolled in the program manifest fewer behavioral problems compared with children who are not enrolled. In addition, different program effects are found for girls and boys and for indigenous and non-indigenous children. The ranges where the effect is measured cover a large part of the outcome's distribution, and these ranges include a large proportion of the children in the sample. With regard to cognitive development, only one indicator (short-term memory) shows positive effects. Nevertheless, the results for this indicator demonstrate that children with low values of cognitive development benefit from the program, whereas children with high values do not. Overall, the program has positive effects on child development, especially for the most vulnerable, who are at the bottom of the distribution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,NA,,"Journal, Article",NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

We found that food transfers had no significant impact, but cash transfers led to a significant increase in cognitive measures - about 9 percentage points (and about 0.33 standard deviations) - relative to the control group. We also explored mechanisms and found plausible evidence of the cognitive impacts of cash through both a nutrition pathway (cash improves diet and hygiene, leading to reduction in anemia and improved cognition) and a stimulation pathway (cash increases contributions to preschool teachers, leading to improved preschool capacity and higher preschool attendance, thus resulting in higher quantity and quality of exposure to stimulation).

Over this 24-month evaluation period households received only 20 months’ worth of payments. There was a long gap in cash payments to households in 2011, followed by a triple payment in February 2012 to settle arrears. Thus, LEAP households did not receive a steady flow of predictable cash with which to smooth their consumption. However the implementation of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) coverage among LEAP households was impressive, with 90 percent of LEAP households having at least one member enrolled in NHIS at the follow-up. Positive impacts on children’s schooling  LEAP has increased school enrollment among secondary school aged children by 7percentage points (pp), and reduced grade repetition among both primary and secondary aged children. Among primary aged children LEAP has reduced absenteeism by 10 percentage points. Despite increased NHIS coverage mixed results on health utilization and morbidity  Despite the large increase in NHIS coverage, LEAP has not had an impact on curative care seeking but has increased preventive care for children age 0-5 in male headed households. Results on morbidity are mixed, increasing for children 0-5 but decreasing for children 6-17. Gender impacts on children  There are some gender differentiated impacts of LEAP on children. Secondary school enrollment impacts are limited to boys, but attendance impacts are bigger for girls. At the household level, impacts on food security and happiness are larger among female headed households. No impacts on consumption  The impact of LEAP on household consumption is essentially zero, likely due to the irregular payments, the lumpy nature of payments when made, and the low level of benefits. Positive impacts on non-consumption  LEAP has led to a significant increase in the likelihood of holding savings (11 pp) and a significant increase in gifts received. LEAP has also had an impact on debt repayments and reduced loan holdings, particularly among female headed households. There are some productivity impacts of LEAP. Among households with four members or less there are positive impacts of own labor supplied to the farm by men and women, and on expenditure on seeds. On the other hand, there are reductions in labor hired in by households though this reduction is lower than the increase in own labor. LEAP appears to be strengthening social networks  The pattern of impacts of LEAP suggests that the program is allowing beneficiaries to re-establish or strengthen social networks. LEAP has had a positive impact on both the value of gifts received and the amount of credit extended to others. LEAP household heads are happier  LEAP has led to a 16 pp increase in household heads who feel happy about their life, especially among female-headed and smaller households. Alignment of results with qualitative study  The qualitative study by OPM (2013) corroborates the positive impacts of LEAP that we find from the quantitative study. These include the findings on increased consumption of fats (palm oil), strengthening of social networks through gifts and transfers, debt repayment, savings, and overall self-esteem, aspirations and happiness. The pattern of impacts revealed here is consistent with the implementation of LEAP. The overall low level of LEAP benefits coupled with sporadic payments and the large lump-sum in February 2012 explains the lack of impacts on consumption and the increase in nonconsumption activities such as savings and reductions in debt. These activities appear to have strengthened the social networks of LEAP households. Implication of results  There are three key issues that arise from the results presented here. First is the low value of the LEAP transfer—this issue has been partially resolved by a tripling of the transfer level from January 2012. Second is the irregular payment cycles which do not allow households to smooth their permanent consumption. This is a key operational bottleneck for LEAP. The third issue is the somewhat inconsistent finding of a strong increase in NHIS coverage among LEAP households but no commensurable impact on utilization of health services or reductions in out-of-pocket health expenditure. This suggests there are weaknesses in linking LEAP beneficiaries to health services which requires further attention.",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,

It finds that the program is successful in increasing the enrollment of girls in classes 6 to 8 as intended. It also finds evidence to suggest that the program generated positive spillover effects on the enrollment of boys. This success does, however, appear to be poised to come at a cost. The student-teacher ratio in treated districts is also climbing. This suggests that in the absence of active steps to address these increasing student-teacher ratios, instructional quality is likely to suffer.

Since households receive the cash and parents are responsible for making spending decisions, we also examine the intervening pathways between cash transfers and child schooling. Data comes from a cluster-randomized study of Malawi's Social Cash Transfer Program (SCTP). After a baseline survey, households in village clusters were randomly assigned to treatment and control arms with treatment villages receiving transfers immediately and control villages assigned a later entry. We test for treatment impacts on a panel of school-aged children (6–17) using a differences-in-differences model. After a years’ worth of transfers, we find the Malawi SCTP both improves enrollment rates and decreases dropouts. The main intervening pathway between the program and schooling is education expenditures, suggesting that the cash improves the demand for education by reducing financial constraints.

53902155,Latham (2013),2013,"Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs are increasingly being used through the developing world to reduce inequality, break the intergenerational poverty cycle, and build human capital. These programs vary by country but typically make cash transfers conditional upon children meeting certain healthcare and educational standards. While previous research finds that these programs are effective at increasing school enrollment and attendance, there is little evidence that it actually increases academic achievement. This paper examines the impact of Familias en Acción, a CCT in Colombia, on the academic achievement of students from households receiving the subsidies, and the impact of the program on school quality. Program evaluation data is used to conduct a logistic regression to measure the programs effects on literacy and grade retention, and national standardized test results are used to conduct an Ordinary Least Squares Regression on academic performance at the school level. The results show that Familias en Acción increases literacy and decreases grade retention amongst the students receiving the subsidy. While the students participating in the program are not found to have no impact on schools, the overall increase in enrollment does have a negative impact on school level math scores. These findings support the growing use of CCT strategies to increase human capital and alleviate poverty. However, the program still allows for geographic and socio-economic differentials in academic attainment to persist. Additional program options should be investigated to address these concerns.

These included supplementing income to increase household expenditures on food, reducing primary school desertion, and improving the health care and nutritional status of children under age 5. The evaluation design is based on a randomized, community-based intervention with measurements before and after the intervention in both treatment and control communities. Where possible, we erred on the side of assessing effects in conservative manners, for example, in the calculation of standard errors and the treatment of possible control group contamination. Overall, we find that RPS had positive (or favorable) and significant double-difference estimated average effects on a broad range of indicators and outcomes. Where it did not, it was often due to similar, smaller improvements in the control group that appear to have been stimulated indirectly by the program.

This paper uses the municipal-level randomized assignment of a CCT program implemented for five years in Honduras to estimate long-term effects 13 years after the program began. We estimate intent-to-treat effects using individual-level data from the population census, which allows assignment of individuals to their municipality of birth, thereby circumventing migration selection concerns. For the non-indigenous, we find positive and robust impacts on educational outcomes for cohorts of a very wide age range. These include increases of more than 50 percent for secondary school completion rates and the probability of reaching university studies for those exposed at school-going ages. They also include substantive gains for grades attained and current enrollment for others exposed during early childhood, raising the possibility of further gains going forward. Educational gains are, however, more limited for the indigenous. Finally, exposure to the CCT increased the probability of international migration for young men, from 3 to 7 percentage points, also stronger for the non-indigenous.

The purpose of this project is to experimentally evaluate the effects of this three-year innovative holistic conditional cash transfer (CCT) initiative. This paper presents initial findings from an ongoing and comprehensive evaluation of Family Rewards. It examines the program's implementation in the field and families' responses to it during the first two of its three years of operations, and early findings on the program's impacts on children's educational processes and outcomes. More specifically, this paper addresses the following questions  (1) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on family income, poverty, and financial hardship?  (2) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on use of health care and health insurance?  (3) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on parents' employment and educational attainment?  and (4) What are the effects of ONYC-Family Rewards on children's educational outcomes? Overall, this study shows that, despite an extraordinarily rapid start-up, the program was operating largely as intended by its second year. Although many families struggled with the complexity of the program, most were substantially engaged with it and received a large amount of money for meeting the conditions it established. Specifically, nearly all families (98 percent) earned at least some rewards in both program years, with payments averaging more than $6,000 during the first two program years combined. The program reduced current poverty and hardship  increased savings  increased families' continuous use of health insurance coverage and increased their receipt of medical care  and increased employment in jobs that are not covered by the unemployment insurance (UI) system but reduced employment in UI-covered jobs. The program has had mixed success in improving children's academic performance specifically. Contrary to expectations, Family Rewards did not affect school attendance or annual standardized test scores in Math and English Language Arts (ELA) for either group of youngest children, but did lead to notable gains for a group of more academically prepared high school students. The program also had important effects on several key proposed mediators of the intervention. However, these effects vary by parents with different age groups of children.

53902168,Miller (2016),2016,"Family Rewards was an innovative approach to poverty reduction in the United States that was modeled on the conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs common in lower- and middle-income countries. The program offered cash assistance to low-income families, provided that they met certain conditions related to family health care, children's education, and parents' work. The first version of Family Rewards, called Opportunity NYC--Family Rewards (""Family Rewards 1.0""), was evaluated in New York City beginning in 2007 using a randomized controlled trial, in which families were randomly assigned to a program group that was offered the program or a control group that was not. Family Rewards 2.0, the subject of this report, was launched in July 2011 in the Bronx, New York, and Memphis, Tennessee. While still offering rewards in the areas of children's education, family health, and parents' work, Family Rewards 2.0 refined the original model in several ways  it offered fewer rewards in each domain, paid those rewards more frequently, offered the education rewards only to high school students, and offered proactive and personalized guidance to help families earn rewards. The addition of guidance from staff members, who actively helped families develop strategies to earn rewards, represented the biggest change from the original model. This report examines whether those changes led to bigger impacts and whether the program had similar effects in a context different from New York City. The findings show that the new program achieved many of the same effects as the original model, but fell short in other, important ways. Family Rewards 2.0 met its short-term goals of increasing income and reducing poverty, although the effects were smaller, given that less money was transferred overall. The program also increased dental visits and adults' self-reported health status, particularly for those in poorer health at study entry. Similar to the earlier program, the new model led to reductions in work and earnings for some participants. However, the new program did not affect students' school progress through Year 4, neither for the full sample of students nor for a more academically prepared subgroup. Overall, the findings indicate that Family Rewards 2.0 did not lead to bigger or more widespread effects. In addition, the failure to replicate the positive effects on school progress for more academically prepared students suggests that the model's effects on education were not very robust.

53902559,Mostert (2020),2020,"Cash transfer (CT) policy is promoted as an important financial vehicle to address household poverty and bring positive societal development. This study investigates the impact of an unconditional CT policy on children's education outcomes focusing on both the primary and secondary phases of education. We also examine the spillover effect of CT policy on parents' employment. To identify these effects we focus on South Africa and exploit the changes in age eligibility requirements of the CT policy to build credible control and treatment groups based on birth cohort. Our results show that CT policy improves reading and writing abilities at both the primary (by 3.7% and 3.3% respectively) and secondary education levels (by 10.2% and 10.1%, respectively) but it fosters school attendance only in secondary education. We also provide evidence that, for primary education students, the effects are only significant for boys. Notably, the positive effects of CT programs are also confirmed by the presence of spillover effects to other members of the family in our observance of increases in both mothers' and fathers' employment outcomes (by 35% and 34%, respectively). Therefore, in this paper we provide robust evidence that unconditional CT policy supports resilient development of the country's population in several dimensions that go beyond the educational achievement of targeted children.

The evaluation design consists of a randomized experiment for families around the first quintile of the poverty index and of a regression discontinuity design for families around the second quintile of this index, which is the program's eligibility threshold.

These programs aim to influence the accumulation of human capital, as well as reduce poverty. In terms of educational outcomes, a number of impact evaluation studies have shown that such programs have led to an increase in school enrollment, ensured regular school attendance and led to a reduction in child labor. Theoretically, such cash transfer programs may also be expected to exert a positive impact on students' test scores, but related empirical evidence is scarce. Accordingly, this paper evaluates the impact of a cash transfer program, the Bono de Desarrollo Humano of Ecuador, on students' cognitive achievements. The paper uses a regression discontinuity strategy to identify the impact of the program on second grade cognitive achievement. Regardless of the specification and sample used, we find no impact of the program on test scores, suggesting that attempts at building human capital, as measured by cognitive achievement, require additional and alternative interventions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract This paper explores the short and medium term impacts of unconditional cash transfers on school-related choices for children of beneficiary households in Rwanda. We draw on an independent evaluation of the Concern Worldwide Graduation Programme, which supported beneficiaries with monthly cash transfers and livelihood training. Our study finds that the programme enabled poor households to overcome income constraints and, consequently, allowed them to make investments in education. However, since school attendance already exceeded 80 percent at baseline due to the government's focus on universal access to basic education, the programme was unable to induce additional educational access. Thus, for children who remain out of school, income effects and policy efforts were found to be ineffective.

This is a large program -- in 2004, the BDH budget was approximately 0.7% of gross domestic product. Estimates show that program effects on enrollment are only significant among conditioned households. In Ecuador, schooling requirements were announced, but never enforced.

PROGRESA is a new program of the Mexican government aimed at alleviating extreme poverty in rural areas. It combats the different causes of poverty by providing cash benefits that are targeted directly to households on the condition of children attending school and visiting health clinics on a regular basis. Some of the questions addressed are as follows  Does the program reduce child labor? Does it increase participation in school activities? Does the latter occur at the expense of children's leisure time? And how do the effects of the program vary by age group and gender? Our empirical analysis relies on data from a quasi-experimental design used to evaluate the impact of the program involving a sample of communities that receive PROGRESA benefits (treatment) and comparable communities that receive benefits at a later time (control).

While numerous rigorous impact evaluations have shown that they have been successful in increasing school enrollment and attendance, the evidence on learning achievement is still mixed, and there are no studies that analyze the effect on school placement. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that the Programme of Advancement through Health and Education (PATH), Jamaica’s CCT program, contributes to breaking the intergenerational poverty cycle by placing its urban beneficiaries on a higher educational trajectory. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that PATH urban male beneficiaries who sat the Grade Six Achievement Test (GSAT) over the period 2010–14 performed better on the test (scoring 22.48 points, or 5.1%, higher than non-beneficiaries)  consequently, they were placed in better secondary schools (7.2 percentiles higher in a national school ranking based on preprogram GSAT scores).

I find that increased probability of receiving a Child Support Grant is associated with increased school attendance, decreased child hunger, and increased broad labor force participation, while it has no identifiable effect on narrow labor force participation or employment. The magnitude of these effects is economically significant  most notably, grant receipt appears to decrease the probability that a schoolage child is not attending school by over half. Although not strictly comparable, this effect is actually larger than Skoufias (2001) measures for Progresa transfer program in Mexico, which conditions grant payment on child school attendance. These results are robust across different specifications, but the CSG’s effects appear to be most positive among mothers living in informal dwellings and mothers and household heads with less education. Although the grant’s impact on school attendance is the same for boys and girls, the effect is much larger for children that are living with their mother. The CSG has its effect on school attendance almost entirely on the child who receives the grant, rather than being spread equally among all children in the household, which suggests that grant income is not pooled with other household income sources, contrary to previous studies conducted on the Old Age Pension",NA,NA,,Report,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,N,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,
